"A 25-year-old man abducted, raped and robbed two women under the influence of alcohol in six months. He reported that his father often physically and psychologically abused him and his mother during his childhood and that a teenager raped him when he was a child. He was unschooled and few years before the rapes he was convicted for having stabbed a man who had insulted him. After having been released, he committed several burglaries. Moreover, he reported to have frequently beaten his wife and to have often fantasized about raping women since he was very young, even if he knew rape was illegal. Finally, he reported to have begun to consume alcohol during his childhood, albeit he never became an alcoholic.\nHence, the court requested a forensic psychiatrist to assess the capacity of the defendant.\nA full clinical/neuropsychological examination was performed. No clinical/electroencephalographical signs of neurological impairment and no signs of alcohol-dependence were observed. An intelligence quotient (IQ) of 59 was found and an antisocial personality disorder was diagnosed. A genetic test focused on five genes (MAOA, COMT, SLC6A4, HTR1B, and DRD4) found a 3-repeat variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) variant of MAOA and a TT genotype for the rs13212041 polymorphism of the HTR1B gene."
"A 25-year-old man was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy 12 years ago, which was treated with carbamazepine and zonisamide. Subsequently, valproate and lacosamide were added 5 and 3 years ago, respectively, due to poor seizure control. During a regular visit, a neurologist noticed that the patient's serum creatinine level increased from 0.98 to 1.29 mg/dL over 6 months. As his serum creatinine level continued to increase to 1.74 mg/dL, he was referred to the nephrology department. He presented no symptoms, and physical examination revealed no abnormal findings. Laboratory analyses showed renal dysfunction, mildly elevated C-reactive protein levels, and increased levels of urinary markers for tubular injury (see Table ). Renal biopsy was performed. Although the glomeruli were intact, there was marked interstitial lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration (Fig. A, B), suggestive of AIN. No immunoglobulin or complement deposition was observed. Since he had no other organ involvement (including uveitis) and no laboratory findings suggestive of autoimmune disorders such as sarcoidosis and Sjögren's syndrome, the AIN was ascribed to drug allergy. Based on a positive result of lymphocyte stimulation test (LST), zonisamide was discontinued and daily oral prednisolone (40 mg, 0.8 mg/kg) was started.\nSerum creatinine levels decreased to 1.35 mg/dl and prednisolone dose was tapered monthly. However, 10 months later, serum creatinine levels increased again to 2.07 mg/dL (Fig. ). 67Ga scintigraphy revealed significant radioactive tracer uptake in both kidneys (Fig. C), suggestive of AIN recurrence. Oral prednisolone (40 mg/d) was restarted, and valproate and lacosamide were discontinued based on a neurologist's recommendation. Renal function immediately improved, although minor epilepsy occurrence increased. Oral prednisolone was gradually tapered to 10 mg/d, after which serum creatinine levels increased again to 1.99 mg/dL. Repeat renal biopsy revealed similar findings of tubulitis with both lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrations. Prednisolone dose was increased to 60 mg (1.0 mg/kg) daily; nevertheless, it was difficult to discontinue carbamazepine due to the need for major epilepsy prevention. Since the patient had multiple AIN recurrence and was corticosteroid dependent, 1500 mg daily of oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was added to the corticosteroid therapy. This treatment was well tolerated and enable successful prednisolone dose tapering to 5 mg daily, with serum creatinine level stabilization (Fig. ). He experienced no AIN recurrence with MMF treatment for over 20 months."
"This is an otherwise healthy 25-year-old male who was brought to our emergency department by ambulance after a fall of 8-10 meters; while leaning against the railing of a third-story balcony he lost balance and fell backward over the rail to the ground below. Emergency personnel at the scene found him comatose and pulseless. After several rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and rapid sequence intubation, he was stabilized for transport to our hospital. On arrival to the emergency department, he had developed refractory hypotension and lost a carotid pulse for which he again required a round of CPR before return of spontaneous circulation. Once resuscitated and stabilized, head, spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans were obtained. He was found to have bilateral temporal bone fractures as well as a transverse clival fracture, as well as diffuse but predominantly right-sided traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhages with scattered locules of pneumocephalus (Figure ). Spinal imaging revealed intradural air at the L3-L4 levels (Figure ). There was no imaging evidence of direct spinal trauma, nor any evidence of pneumothorax or pneumoperitoneum.\nNeurological examination on arrival revealed an intubated young male with a GCS of 6T: he did not open his eyes nor display any localizing movements but was able to withdraw all of his extremities from painful stimuli. He had dried blood in both ears but was otherwise without otorrhea or rhinorrhea.\nHe was admitted to our trauma ICU and an intracranial pressure monitor was placed and monitoring was noted as normal. A follow-up head CT was unchanged. His GCS improved rapidly and he was extubated 11 hours after admission, and his intracranial monitor was removed. Repeat neurological examination noted that he was coherent and oriented, but amnestic to his injury. He had developed a left facial nerve paresis and was prescribed a two-week course of prednisone without significant improvement noted by the time of discharge. He remained without strength or sensation deficits of his extremities. Pelvic injuries necessitated operative fixation on hospital day 2. He was discharged to rehabilitation in good condition on post-injury day 8."
"Case 13 concerns a 25-year-old man who was found dead in his flat. The autopsy revealed that the immediate cause of death was acute cardiac failure in the mechanism of arrhythmias due to chronic focal lesions in the myocardium. Moreover, according to the forensic pathologist, considering the pathomechanism of his death, the acute cardiac failure does not contradict the possibility of an unknown substance being co-responsible for the intoxication. This is suggested by the presence of gastric contents in his respiratory tract as a result of vomiting. Therefore, this case may be considered death resulting from a mixed causes of myocardium lesions with 4-CMC and amphetamine intoxication, as the concentrations determined in his blood (394 and 2200 ng/mL, respectively) are relatively high, and the detected concentration of amphetamine can be fatal to a nonaddict []."
"A 25-year-old woman was hospitalized due to frequent premature ventricular beats of high grade (17,000 per day) and repeated episodes of bidirectional non-sustained ventricular tachycardia without syncope. Echocardiography revealed enlarged left ventricular dimension and local ventricular wall thinning. Upon routine clinical examination bilateral symmetrical hand abnormality was noted, namely the fifth finger camptodactyly (Figure ). Additionally, hypoplasia of the breast with inverted nipples was observed (Figure ). Facial features included wide-set eyes, a broad nasal tip and thin upper lip vermilion and strabismus (Figure ). Dental abnormalities were represented by tooth malalignment and hypoplasia involving canines and back teeth (Figures ). No defects were documented in her lower limbs. Apart from physical defects, intellectual deficit was noted and included mild mental retardation and learning disabilities. Family history reported that proband’s mother died due to congenital heart defect and congestive heart failure at the age of 30. Grandmother from mother side was not affected. No other relatives were available for examination. Due to the lack of family data, it is hard to conclude the mode of inheritance unambiguously. However, keeping in mind the mother’s phenotype, the dominant inheritance could be suggested (Supplementary Figure )."
"A 25-year-old female with a two-year history of erythema, papules, nodules, and scales on her sole of left foot was presented to our outpatient center. She has no history of autoimmue disease and untreated with immunosuppressive therapy. Considering her pregnancy, she was not given treatments for 1 year. The left foot skin lesion on the medial and lateral margins and on the fourth toe dorsum became enlarged with evident pain after more than 1 year (Fig. ). Approximately 1 month before visiting our department, she received treatment ineffectively in a local clinic, and the diagnosis was unclear.\nSamples were obtained by the scraping of lesion and for light microscopy. Hyphae were observed by microscopic examination (Fig. ).\nWe carried out a skin tissue biopsy, which showed multiple granulomatous nodules (Fig. ). The Ziehl–Neelsen stain was negative. Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) staining were carried out two times. Results were also negative. Biopsy specimens were also inoculated onto two kinds of media: Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA), where one of which contained chloramphenicol and cycloheximide, and the other one contained chloramphenicol only. After being cultured on SDA at 27 °C for 7 days, spreading-woolly-white colonies grew on the inoculation sites of media containing chloramphenicol only and there,s no other colonies grew (Fig. ). The colonies produced an unpleasant smell like biogas. No colony was observed on the media with chloramphenicol and cycloheximide. Clamp connections, spicules, tear-like secretions, and medusa-like isomers were observed on the slide culture at 27 °C after 3 days (Fig. ). Urease activity tests were also performed. Trichophyton rubrum standard strain and the isolated strain were cultured on urease media at 27 °C for 7 days. The T. rubrum standard strain was negative, whereas the isolated strain turned red (Fig. ).\nSequencing of large subunit rDNA was performed by using the E.Z.N.A.™ Fungal DNA Mini Kit (Omega Biotek, USA). We utilized set primers for the region of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and performed PCR. The PCR primers were ITS1: 5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′ and ITS4: 5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′. The PCR-amplified DNA was matched with that of S. commune (Nos. KP 326677.1 and KP 004975.1) with a homology of 100%. After identification, the sequence was submitted to the GenBank (MF 495704).\nPathological finding and mycological examination indicated a cutaneous granuloma caused by S. commune. Oral itraconazole (100 mg) was applied twice a day. The rashes on the left foot and the pain regressed after 1 month of treatment (Fig. ). Follow-up is currently under way."
"A 25-year-old woman underwent ultrasound examination for a palpable mass in the middle phalanx of her left ring finger. A hypoechoic mass of 20 mm diameter was found. The boundary of the mass was unclear and punctuate or patchy hyperechoic calcification was present in the mass. The bone cortex was involved, with a broken continuity. In addition, a point-like blood signal was observed on switching to Doppler mode (Fig. ). Notably, the pathology report showed active proliferation in the tumor cells. A mass with bone erosion was diagnosed."
"A 25-year-old man with no past medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with two days of intractable vomiting, increasing confusion, and progressive difficulty breathing. The patient denied tobacco or recreational drug use.\nUpon arrival to the ED, vital signs were within normal range with a blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg, a temperature of 36.8 degree Celsius, a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 19 respirations per minute. The physical exam showed an obese, lethargic patient, responsive to verbal stimuli. The lung, heart, and abdomen exam were unremarkable and there was no neck crepitus noted. The laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis of 25.96 x 1000/mm3, elevated creatinine of 2.17 mg/dL, hyperglycemia of 836 mg/dL, hyponatremia of 128 mEq/L, hyperkalemia of 5.2 mEq/L, and bicarbonate of 5 mEq/L. The anion gap was 25 and a venous blood gas showed a pH of 6.91. Urinalysis was positive for 2+ ketones and 1+ protein.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus complicated with DKA. Intravenous normal saline, bicarbonate, and insulin drip were initiated. The chest X-ray on admission suggested findings compatible with pneumomediastinum (Figure ). Chest computed tomography (CT) was obtained and reaffirmed the findings (Figures -). Pneumomediastinum in the setting of intractable vomiting was worrisome for esophageal rupture and since our facility was not staffed to manage this clinical entity, the patient was emergently transferred to another facility. The patient was treated conservatively with analgesia and respiratory support and was discharged several days later without any complications."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred to our radiology department by her family doctor for an MRI examination of the left knee because of a “crackling” noise of three months duration. There were no complaints of instability, swelling or pain. Physical examination showed anterior laxity of the knee. There was no recent history of trauma. The patient is known with a congenital shortening of the left leg for which she has already undergone a leg lengthening procedure.\nThe MRI examination shows multiple anatomic anomalies. The most notable is the absence of the anterior cruciate ligament (Fig. ). The posterior cruciate ligament is present but appears hypoplastic (Fig. ). The lateral intercondylar spine is absent and the lateral meniscus is hypoplastic (Fig. ). There is severe trochlear dysplasia due to hypoplasia of the lateral femoral condyle and medial patellar facet hypoplasia (Fig. ). Sequellae of earlier leg lengthening procedure can be seen: the left fibula is absent and metallic artefacts are present in the tibia.\nUp to this date, the patient was treated conservatively."
"A 25 years old unmarried female developed a painless, firm, round, mobile swelling in right breast since one year which was growing in size progressively. It was incised by a quack under local anesthesia three month back, which started growing with a great speed since that period.\nIt was hanging from the chest, painless, fungating ( and ), discharging offensive fluid. Its size was 30x25cms. It was hindering in performing her daily routine jobs. She was grossly anemic and clinically there were no glands in axilla. X-ray chest was clear; Hb was 6g/dl. There was no history of any breast ailment in the family. Preoperative open biopsy was taken which revealed benign phyllodes tumor on histopathology. The tumor had a loose adhesion with the pectoral major."
"A 25-year-old woman underwent fluoroscopic-guided lumbar puncture for new-onset occipital headaches primarily on the right side occasionally radiating to the temporal region. The initial pressure was 10 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 11 cm of H2O by fluid column method. A total of 18 cc of clear CSF was obtained. The final pressure was 6 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 7 cm of H2O by fluid column method. The patient developed headaches (rated as 10/10 in severity) that were exacerbated by upright posture postprocedure. The headache continued for 5 days postprocedure and had not improved with hydromorphone, acetaminophen, decadron, indomethacin, lorazepam, caffeine sodium benzoate, and hydrocodone-acetaminophen treatment. The patient underwent an occipital nerve block which did not reduce the severity of the positional headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement demonstrated protrusion of cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, slit ventricles, and enhancement of dura. The patient underwent epidural injection of whole blood and reported complete resolution of headaches (0/10) and was able to ambulate without any difficulty."
"An otherwise healthy 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a substernal chest pain for an hour accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting. The chest pain was sudden in onset, 8/10 in intensity, and radiating to his right arm. The chest pain was slightly relieved on lying flat and aggravated by walking. He had no associated symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, or rash. He did not have any antecedent infection.\nPatient’s past medical, surgical and family history was unremarkable, and he had no modifiable or non-modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. He had no known allergic reaction to food or drugs. He was a nonsmoker and did not use any illicit drugs. A comprehensive history revealed a daily intake of seven to nine cans of caffeinated energy drinks for the past week. The patient reported significant improvement in his chest pain after receiving sublingual nitroglycerin and diamorphine intravenously.\nHis vital signs on examination were (1) Temperature: afebrile, (2) Blood Pressure: 155/95 mmHg in his right arm and 150/90 mm Hg in his left arm, (3) Respiratory Rate: 25 breaths/min, d-Heart Rate: 110 beats/min. Pulse oximetry showed 98% oxygen saturation on room air. Cardiac examination revealed S4 on auscultation of the chest. On palpation of the chest, there was no point tenderness. Rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.\nThe initial electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission (Figure 1) showed sinus rhythm with ST depression in precordial leads V2-V6. Chest X-ray was insignificant with no signs of pulmonary congestion. Laboratory findings were as follow: (1) an elevated level, 32.22 µg/ml, of 12-h troponin I (normal range <0.07); confirming definite acute coronary syndrome. (2) d-Dimers were 380 ng/ml (normal range <500). (3) Thrombophilia and drug screen were negative. After appropriate initial resuscitation for the coronary syndrome, the patient was transferred to the catheterization laboratory for the percutaneous coronary intervention.\nCoronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed ejection fraction of 60% with left ventricular diameters within normal limits. The patient was discharged after five-day observation period and was counseled to limit/stop the ingestion of energy drinks. He was discharged with aspirin, spironolactone, perindopril, and atenolol.\nOn the post-hospital follow-up visit, the patient had completely stopped consuming energy drinks and was symptom-free. TEE at this visit revealed ejection fraction of 62% with preserved global left ventricular function."
"A 25-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a complaint of left-sided body weakness since 12 hours. On clinical examination, the power of the left upper and lower limbs was seen to be limited to just slight movement. Planter reflex was up going on the left side (Babinski positive). Clinical anemia was also present, and the nails showed massive clubbing. According to her parents, she had a history of cyanosis since birth, but they never got treatment for it. There was no history of any psychiatric illness, hypertension, or diabetes.\nA CT (computed tomography) scan showed no evidence of a haemorrhage, but some changes in the temporoparietal area were observed, as shown in Figure . Later, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with contrast was advised and performed, which showed an infarct of the right temporoparietal lobe with mild brain atrophy as shown in Figure and Figure ."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a 14-year history of intellectual disability (since 11 years of age), clumsiness (12 years), spastic ataxia (16 years), slow and slurred speech (17 years), schizophrenic delusions (18 years), dysphagia (19 years), and frequent falls (21 years). He had prolonged neonatal jaundice, for which exploratory laparotomy and simultaneous cholecystectomy were performed at that time. He was also diagnosed with Crohn’s disease at the age of 16 years. Neurological examination at presentation revealed VSGP and involuntary movements including choreoathetosis, dystonia, and myoclonus. Ultrasonography revealed unpalpable mild splenomegaly. The NPC-SI was 98% with a risk prediction score (RPS) of 183 (high likelihood of NPC when the NPC-SI is more than 14% and the RPS is more than 40). Filipin staining of skin fibroblasts showed a variant pattern (Fig. ). Gene analysis of NPC1 using genomic DNA extracted from the patient’s blood via Sanger sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations, including the known c.1421C > T (p.P474L) mutation [] from the father and a novel c.3722 T > C (p.L1241S) mutation from the mother. We deposited the latter mutation to the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD); the individual number of this data entry is 00165102. Oral intake of miglustat for 12 months did not relieve his symptoms. The treatment had to be discontinued because the patient had succumbed to a vegetative state following massive pneumonia secondary to severe ileus due to Crohn’s disease."
"A 25-year-old female was admitted because of petechiae, hematuria, and menorrhagia. Blood tests showed hemolytic anemia and thrombopenia. ADAMTS13 activity was reduced (59 ng/mL) and an inhibitor was detectable (0.75 BU/mL, reference: <0.2 BU/mL). The patient made a quick and complete recovery with steroids, three PEs and a single 1g dose of rituximab. At that time her TSH was normal (0.98 mIU/L).\nTwo years later, after an uneventful pregnancy and a cesarean section, she relapsed with ADAMTS13 of 38 ng/mL and a positive inhibitor test (2.6 BU/mL). She was treated with steroids, ten PEs, and 1g rituximab followed by 0.5g after the first PE and 1g after the plasma exchange series. At that time, her thyroid function was not assessed, but TSH had been normal (0.93 mIU/L) three months earlier.\nAnother two years later the patient had a second relapse with severe headache and petechiae. Again, ADAMTS13 activity was reduced (128 ng/mL) and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies were present (1.89 BU/mL). Besides, she had tachycardia of 120 beats per minute and thyroid function tests confirmed a thyrotoxicosis (). A retrospective analysis of a stored blood sample taken before the first plasma exchange showed elevated TRAbs. Sonography revealed thyroidal hyperperfusion, and pertechnetate uptake was increased upon scintigraphy. TTP was treated with methylprednisolone 1mg/kg body weight as starting dose, thirteen PEs, and 1g rituximab followed by two doses of 0.5 g. Two weeks later the TRAb titer had fallen by three-quarters. GD was treated with thiamazole 20 mg and propranolol 20 mg, each twice a day. Five weeks later the patient had developed subclinical hypothyroidism with low FT4 (). Thiamazole was reduced to 5 mg daily. Three months later the patient had reached a stable euthyroid state and thiamazole was further reduced to 5 mg on alternate days. Eight and twelve months after diagnosis of GD, TRAb levels were in the normal range below 1.75 U/L."
"Patient 2 was a 25-year-old healthy, gravida 4 para 2, woman with a past history of stillbirth at 7 months gestation of unknown etiology. Screening test for aneuploidy was at low risk (1/10,000). At 19 + 5 WG, the patient experienced a maculo-papular pruritic rash associated with mild fever, arthralgia and headaches, compatible with a viral infection. The anatomical scan at 22 + 5 WG showed hydrops fetalis with skin edema, ascites, a large pericardial effusion and prefrontal edema (5.9 mm), associated with symmetric IUGR (estimated fetal weight 427 g; <3rd percentile, biparietal diameter (BPD) of 44 mm (<3rd percentile), HC of 165 mm (<3rd percentile), abdominal circumference of 193 mm (measurement unreliable secondary to presence of ascites), and femur length of 29.7 mm (<3rd percentile). No morphological anomalies were detected (Fig. and ). Non-alloimmune fetal anemia was highly suspected. Amniocentesis and fetal blood sampling were performed, which confirmed severe fetal anemia and thrombocytopenia (Table ) (Hb 3.6 [>15 g/100 ml]; platelets 68 [>150 G/L]). Fetal blood transfusion was performed. The amniotic fluid was positive for PVB-19 DNA, while negative for ZIKV RNA and CMV DNA. However, ZIKV RNA was detected in fetal blood and placenta confirming a combined PVB-19 and ZIKV fetal infection. Congruently, ZIKV RNA was detected in both maternal blood and urine. As persistent viremia has been described in pregnant women [], timing of maternal infection was confirmed based on retrospective serum analysis. The identification of PVB-19 specific IgM at 13 + 5 WG, while both ZIKV specific IgG and IgM were negative confirmed a primary PVB-19 infection in the first trimester (see Timeline presented in Fig. ). Maternal ZIKV infection occurred later and probably correlated with maternal symptoms at 19 + 5 WG. These unspecific symptoms could have corresponded to either a primary ZIKV or PVB-19 infection. Fetal blood analysis revealed an elevation of general inflammatory markers (β2-Microglobulin 7.8 [mg/ml] (<5), total IgM 49 [mg/l] (<20)). Unlike case 1, the GGT remained low, while hepatic cytolysis was observed (GGT 12 [UI/l] (<100), AST 96 [UI/l] (<20)). Due to worsening fetal clinical status after transfusion (absent end diastolic flow on umbilical artery Doppler, increasing ascites, pericardial effusion and skin edema), the patient requested medical termination of pregnancy, which was performed at 25 WG. A stillborn male infant weighing 530 g (<3rd percentile) presenting with significant edema was delivered. No other macroscopic anomalies were noted. Autopsy was declined."
"A 25-year-old gravida-2-para-1 at 20 weeks’ gestation was referred to our department for TTTs. The patient reported abdominal bloating. The diagnosis of TTTs stage 2 was made on the basis of Quintero staging. The deepest vertical pocket was 154 mm for the recipient and 10 mm for the donor twin. The estimated foetal weight (EFW) was less than 10th centile for donor twin. Placental laser surgery was performed after preoperative counselling. Postoperatively, a single-dose 100 mg indomethacin suppository was inserted into the rectum to prevent uterine contractions. On the next day (postoperative day 1), constriction of the ductus arteriosus and tricuspid regurgitation were observed in the donor twin. There was a marked ductal narrowing (). The peak systolic velocity was 149 cm/s (). On postoperative day 3, the transverse diameter of the ductus arteriosus and peak systolic velocity returned to normal (). On postoperative day 5, the tricuspid regurgitation had disappeared and the patient was discharged. On the next day, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to regular contractions and cervical opening and she delivered at 21 weeks and 3 days’ gestation."
"A 25-year-old primigravid female presented to the general surgery outpatient clinic with intermittent epigastric pain, which radiated to the left hypochondrium and left shoulder. This pain was moderate in severity and had persisted for around two months. It was associated with projectile vomiting upon ingestion of solid food materials, as well as watery diarrhea. The patient complained of anorexia and subjective abdominal distension focused in the epigastrium. At that time, the patient had reached her second trimester of pregnancy with no complications in that regard. She reported she was pregnant with twins.\nUpon examination, a large nontender mass was palpated in the epigastric region, extending to the left hypochondrium and umbilical region. It was firm in consistency, immobile, and dull to percussion. Auscultation revealed normal bowel sounds. It did not seem to be attached to the overlying skin and the margins could not be palpated superiorly. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable, with the exception of the expected gravid uterus with twin foetuses.\nAfter further questioning, it became apparent that she had a remote positive history of trichophagia and onychophagia during her childhood. She ate her own hair till the age of 10 and her nails till the age of 17. She had a previous history of iron-deficiency anemia at the age of 18 but had sought treatment with complete resolution.\nAs the mass was large and the extent of it was unknown, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed as an initial investigation to explore the provisional diagnosis of a bezoar. The MRI revealed gastric distension with the presence of a soft tissue mass extending throughout the stomach (Figure ). This confirmed the diagnosis of gastric bezoar, and the patient was admitted as an in-patient and advised for immediate surgery.\nSubsequent to assessment of risk factors and initial blood-work, the patient was scheduled for open laparotomy and surgical bezoar removal five days later. After sterile precautions were taken and appropriate draping was performed, an upper midline incision was made, the muscle layers were retracted, and the stomach was opened between two vicryl sutures. A large trichobezoar was removed, which had taken the exact shape of the distended stomach with a small extension into the duodenum. At the time of removal, its weight was 1.2 kg (Figure ). The stomach was sutured, and the abdomen and skin were closed in layers. With an unremarkable postoperative stay, the patient was discharged at the sixth postoperative day, with a follow-up visit scheduled in the surgery clinic."
"A 25-year-old Asian female with a past medical history of myotonic muscular dystrophy presented to an otolaryngologist with complaints of otalgia. She reported intermittent right ear pain of mild severity, as well as sneezing, itchy nose, and watery eyes for one month. Nasal endoscopy revealed a lobulated, fleshy mass just medial to the right middle turbinate. A CT scan of the sinuses revealed a 3.0 cm mass in the right nasal cavity extending to the roof of the nasal cavity, without an obvious cranial base defect ().\nIt was unclear by imaging characteristics whether the mass represented a nasal polyp, papilloma, or malignant tumor. A biopsy was then performed, which revealed a proliferation of cytologically bland cuboidal cells forming crowded glandular structures, together with many squamoid morules as well as more confluent areas of squamoid metaplasia (Figures and ). Immunohistochemical stains showed tumor cell expression of CK7 and SOX-10 in the glandular but not squamoid areas of the tumor (Figures and ). CK20, CK5/6, and DOG1 were negative. Nuclear β-catenin and CDX2 were strongly expressed in the areas of squamoid morular metaplasia (Figures and ).\nThese findings supported the diagnosis of a low-grade sinonasal non-ITAC. NGS was performed by Foundation Medicine, which detected a missense mutation (S33C) in CTNNB1.\nThe patient subsequently underwent endonasal craniofacial resection of the tumor to negative margins. Given the low-grade histology and the pathologic stage of T1N0M0, the patient did not require adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation and will undergo close clinical surveillance."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented to emergency department after an assault with an incise wound in the external canthus of the left eye and severe alcohol intoxication, which prevented history taking. The physical exam of the ocular globe was not possible due to the large hematoma that hindered opening the eyelid. The exploration of right eye was normal. Therefore, the skin wound was initially sutured with a polypropylene 5/0 interrupted suture and an orbital computed tomography (CT scan) and skull X-ray were performed. An intraorbital foreign body with triangular shape of 4.6 cm x 2 cm was seen in the left orbit, passing through the orbit and the ocular globe, fracturing the superomedial wall of the orbit, with a probable associated fracture of the ethmoidal cells, and reaching the anterior cranial fossa, causing pneumocephalus (Figures and ). The patient did not present any neurological symptoms beyond his alcohol intoxication nor did he develop rhinorrhea at any time, and the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score was normal (15/15). He remained under observation and was treated with intravenous antibiotic (ciprofloxacin 200 mg twice daily, for five days, selected due to its broad spectrum for gram negative and positive) and corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 80 mg per day for 3 days). Surgical extraction was performed. The foreign body turned out to be a fragment of a dagger. The extraction was done locating the end of the foreign body after removing the suture of the wound and disinserting the lower eyelid to have a wider surgical field. The foreign boy was carefully extracted without exerting force. It was then possible to see a corneoscleral wound 2 cm long affecting the upper cornea 7 mm and the sclera 8 mm located from 9 to 2 o'clock positions. It was closed with nylon 10/0 suture and polyglactin 910 7/0 suture. The entrance area in the orbit was revised, with special attention to the upper nasal quadrant, ruling out the need for repair by neurosurgery (). One week after the surgery, the cornea was transparent, but there were amaurosis, hemophthalmos, and hypotony (). The patient remained painless. Evolution to phthisis bulbi was evident, with clouding and folds in the cornea, shrinkage of the eyeball and a very soft tone, and six months later the eye was eviscerated. Two years later there were no signs of sympathetic ophthalmia in the right eye, whose examination remained completely normal."
"A 25-year-old woman temporarily living in Grenada visited a local otolaryngologist presenting with a past history of Meniere’s disease without treatment (based on a lack of active symptoms such as tinnitus, vertigo, and hearing loss). On presentation, she expressed that the motivation behind the visit was to investigate the significance of her neck swelling. She had missed her period for two consecutive months. Routine examination showed a swelling over the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, midway along its anterior border (Figure ). The swelling was small, firm, subcutaneous, and partially attached to the skin. It had been present for as long as she could remember, with no associated symptoms. The history suggested a benign lesion consistent with the characteristics of a CCBR-choristoma.\nFamily history was unremarkable. No visible congenital anomalies such as aberrant implantation of the ears, auricular pits, auricular appendages, or fistulae were present. The swelling was about 0.75 cm in length x 0.5 cm in width. Palpation revealed a nontender structure in the subcutaneous plane unattached to the underlying tissue and mobile in every direction. The overlying skin was partially attached to the swelling, but it did not originate from within the skin (the skin above the swelling could be pinched up). No cervical lymph nodes draining the area were palpable. Examination of the left neck was unremarkable.\nDue to her anxiety with respect to conceiving, and the risk of teratogenic radiological exposure, an ultrasound-based examination of the neck and cardio-abdomino-pelvic organs was performed to identify if her CCBR had associated defects. Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic (likely cartilaginous) mass measuring 0.94 cm x 0.43 cm (Figure ). Abdominal ultrasound and cardiac examination are recommended because of possible associated anomalies []. These anomalies must be taken into consideration, as there is marked variation in the reported prevalence of associated anomalies, ranging from 11% to 76% []. Thus ultrasound, being the least invasive diagnostic technique, while also serving the patient with maximum utility, was the modality of choice.\nThe patient did not request surgical excision, as she was asymptomatic with the lesion for the duration of her lifetime. She was told, and reassured, that the ultrasound examination showed a benign cartilaginous mass. The ultrasound of her heart, abdomen, and pelvic organs also showed no abnormalities. This diagnosis allowed the patient to feel some comfort after what she assumed could have affected the health of her baby."
"We report the case of a 25-year-old female patient with a long-standing history of psychiatric disorder on medical treatment who was referred to our unit from a health centre with a history of abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and failure to pass stool and flatus for one week. On examination, the patient had disorganized speech, abnormal motor behavior, and lack of emotional expression. The abdomen was distended to below the umbilicus, irregular hard multiple masses were palpable below the umbilicus, and bowel sounds were found to be exaggerated. Abdominal pelvic ultrasound was done and revealed abnormal materials in the abdominal cavity. Barium meal X-ray was done and showed the stomach being located in the pelvic brim. It also showed stenosis in some parts of the gastrointestinal tract and irregularities in other parts (Figures and ).\nBased on the clinical presentation and X-ray findings, a decision to operate was reached. Laparotomy was done, and the stomach was found to be distended reaching the pelvis. Gastrotomy was then performed ().\nDifferent metallic and nonmetallic materials were found in the stomach and proximal part of the small intestine. They were both carefully retrieved. The instruments were of various sizes and included iron nails, arrows, wheel spokes, dinner forks, broken handles of spoons with sharp edges, and many other objects weighing a total of 780 mg (Figures –). The longest instrument was found to be approximately 80 mm long, and it was a nail. There was no evidence of either perforation or ulceration of both the stomach and proximal bowel. The final diagnosis of metalophagia was reached. The patient recovered and did well a few days postoperatively and was referred back to the psychiatric hospital."
"A 25-year-old Mexican female with family history of ovarian cancer at her maternal side and personal history of a mass on her right breast clinically and radiologically diagnosed as fibroadenoma 2 years ago. The same mass had a growth of 2 cm so an incisional biopsy was performed at another institution. This was positive for mucinous carcinoma, and the patient was referred to our institution for treatment and follow up.\nAt our institution in the biopsy slides revision, we found a tumor composed of mucinous lakes with numerous tumor cells of medium to large size with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm confirming the presence of pure mucinous carcinoma. We could not identify the tumor size and surgical margins by no prior radiological and pathological report. []. The tumor was classified as a Low grade tumor (G1) based on the Scarff Bloom Richardson scale. We did not observe perineural or vascular invasion. On immunohistochemistry the results were 100% and 90% positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors respectively with high intensity, and HER2 receptors negative.\nOn physical examination a surgical injury was seen. Upon palpation, this zone felt indurated, edematous and presented as a rough irregular texture. No other lesions were found. An ultrasound was performed, showing avascular distortion and a heterogeneous mass with microcysts (white arrows) []. MRI showed a hypointense irregular mass that indicates a mild enhancement in contrast sequences and a hyperintense sequence in SPAIR. The evaluation of the lymph nodes was not suspicious for metastasis.\nWith the radiological suspicious of residual tumor and pathological findings accomplished at our institution a partial mastectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Pathological findings showed a residual mass of 25 mm of pure mucinous carcinoma with negative surgical margins. Sentinel lymph node was negative for metastasis.\nMolecular screening with EndoPredict clinic showed a score of 2.7 classifying it as a low risk, reason why this patient was treated with tamoxifen because her positivity to receptors and low risk showed in molecular assay. The clinical and pathological stage IB was confirmed."
"We present the case of a 25 year old lady from Papua New Guinea who was admitted to the Cairns base hospital (CBH) with a 3 day history of abdominal pain and distension on a background of being 20 weeks pregnant. She had a slightly elevated white cell count upon admission, was haemodynamically stable and tolerating oral diet. The patient had last passed a bowel motion 2 days prior.\nPlain abdominal X-ray and chest X-ray showed mild gaseous distension of her small bowel and right colon. Her admission diagnosis was possible abdominal tuberculosis (TB) given she had previous TB and was from an endemic area. On day 3 of her admission she became tachycardic and tachypnoeic with a grossly distended abdomen and worsening abdominal pain. She was febrile with a white cell count of 19 × 109/L cells, lactate 3.2 mmol/L and haemoglobin of 126 g/L. An urgent MRI of her abdomen was performed, showing a likely large bowel volvulus with associated free fluid, but no perforation (, ).\nGiven the patients worsening clinical condition and imaging findings she was taken for an urgent laparotomy. A splenic flexure volvulus with gangrenous colon was found (, ) and the patient underwent a left hemicolectomy and end colostomy. The decision was made not to perform a primary anastomosis given her clinical condition and the risk presented by a potential anastomotic leak adjacent to the gravid uterus. She had pre and postoperative obstetric team review. The patient recovered well and delivered a healthy baby at full term 4 months later. She underwent a reversal of her colostomy 6 months later and was discharged home without incident. Happily both mother and baby were both well at follow up in the outpatient clinic."
"A 25-year-old, gravida 1, para 0, woman underwent amniocentesis for cytogenetic and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis at 18 weeks of gestation because of the increased Down syndrome risk of 1/13, calculated from a low maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level of 0.820 multiple of median (MoM), a low uE3 level of 0.178 MoM, and a high human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level of 4.574 MoM in the second trimester. Meanwhile, 20 weeks’ sonography findings indicated the abnormalities of single ventricle in intracalvarium, thalmus partially fused, and polycystic kidneys (Fig. ). She and her husband were nonconsanguineous and healthy. There was no family history of diabetes mellitus or congenital malformations. The mother denied any exposure to alcohol, teratogenic agents, irradiation, or infectious diseases during this pregnancy. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Jilin University, and written informed consent was obtained from the couple."
"A 25 year old man from Morocco worked in Mauritania as an engineer in a water dam for 1 year. One month after his return to Morocco, he has suffered abdominal pain and hematuria wrongly diagnosed in a local clinic as kidney stones.\nHe was admitted to a central hospital with progressive hematuria, he has benefited from a cystoscopy with biopsies. Histological examination of the biopsies revealed a granulomatous inflammatory reaction made of epithelioid and gigantocellular granulomas punctuated by eosinophilic polynuclear cells. These granulomas contain in their centers bilharzia eggs (Fig. ).\nThe diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of Schistosoma heamatobium eggs in direct examination of fresh urine collected (Fig. )."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) at our Level I Trauma Unit after receiving a GSW in the back. The patient was found to be peritonitic and tachycardic upon physical examination in the ED triage. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma exam showed fluid in the peritoneum. A resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) was deployed in the ED for active proximal control of the hemorrhage. He was transferred to the operating room (OR) for an exploratory laparotomy, where numerous intra-abdominal injuries were found, including a splenic hilum injury, renal artery injury, and proximal bowel injury. The patient was noted to have an HSK, making the hemorrhage from the kidney more difficult to control (Figure ). The renal capsule was opened and a 5 mm penetrating wound was found going through the left side of the HSK. Due to ongoing hemorrhage, the REBOA device was once again deployed. A large left renal vein was noted to be lacerated. This vein was ligated using 0-silk suture. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged on postoperative Day 5."
"We present a case of a 25 year-old man who complained of worsening back pain and left lower limb weakness and radiculopathy for two weeks. He was unable to walk due to the pain and weakness. There was no bowel or bladder incontinence but he had loss of appetite and significant weight loss.\nHe had history of fall and sustained a stable burst fracture of T12. He was treated with an extension body cast at that time as there was no suspicious lesion on the radiographs. During follow-up, he developed a kyphotic deformity of which we performed pedicle subtraction osteotomy of T12 a year after the primary injury. He defaulted the follow-up after surgery.\nExamination revealed a posterior midline surgical scar measuring 12cm. There was a mild kyphotic deformity. His hip and knee flexion were weak with a medical research council (MRC) muscle power grading of 3. The ankle and toes had MRC muscle power grading of zero. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was suggestive of an aggressive spinal tumour over T12 with extension to T11 and L1 (). Computed tomography of the lungs revealed no lung metastasis.\nHe underwent posterior extension of fusion from T8-L4 with total vertebrectomy of T11, T12 and L1. Excision of the posterior elements of T11 and L1 then removal of the pedicles of T11 and L1 was done. En bloc tumour removal was attempted but scarring and adhesions to the diaphragm prevented an en bloc removal, so piecemeal vertebrectomy of T11, T12 and L1 and excision of tumour was performed. Three segmental arteries were ligated on the right side to facilitate cage insertion and the bone gap reconstructed with a titanium mesh cage filled with bone cement (). The reconstructed mesh was shorter than the total height of the removed vertebral bodies, as we shortened the spinal column, but not exceeding one vertebral body and two discs height to prevent cord buckling. Intra-operatively there was adhesions due to the previous scarring causing dura and diaphragm tear during excision of the tumour, which we could not repair. A dura sealing agent was used to seal the tears. He lost 7.7 litres of blood during the surgery requiring massive blood transfusion.\nPost-operatively, his neurological deficit improved to MRC muscle grade 5 and he was able to walk with a single crutch with minimal back pain. The wound healed well. At the last follow-up at one and a half years post-operatively, there was complete neurological recovery with good functional outcome. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of GCT of the spine ()."
"A 25-year-old male patient, victim of torsional trauma in the right knee during a soccer match, was brought to the emergency department with a locked knee. At the time of the injury, the patient felt a pop and immediately after, he could not move his knee. Plain radiographs of the knee showed no signs of acute osteoarticular lesions. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging identified a bucket handle tear in the medial meniscus (). The patient was referred to the orthopedic trauma service for emergency surgical treatment.\nOne week after the injury, the patient sought our service. Physical examination revealed the following findings: joint effusion, 30 degrees of flexion, and an inability to actively contract the quadriceps. In the prone position, an important contracture of the hamstring muscle group was observed when compared to the contralateral side (). Based on the patient's history and physical examination, we suspected that the extension deficit resulted from arthrogenic muscle inhibition. A set of exercises was performed, using the technique described by Delaloye et al. [], which usually results in full restoration of the knee extension: the patient was initially placed in prone position, with the feet off the stretcher, and asked to perform active contraction of the hamstrings. The contraction should be held for 2 to 3 seconds. Between contractions, the patient was asked to completely relax the hamstrings. This sequence of exercises was performed repeatedly until fatigue was observed, at which point, a complete hamstring relaxation had occurred. Once full passive extension was recovered, the patient was placed in dorsal decubitus, with the trunk elevated to 90 degrees and with the lower limb in extension. In this position, the patient was instructed to perform isometric contractions of the quadriceps (vastus medialis) until he succeeded in performing an adequate contraction. The patient in our report presented complete extension after approximately 7 min of the resisted exercises ()."
"A 25-year-old man was charged with robbery and incarcerated in a prison. One night, his cellmates found the man snoring loudly, cyanotic and unresponsive in bed. They called the prison staff and sent him to the infirmary. He presented with pulseless and cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, but he died.\nHis medical records indicated that he had a history of recurrent episodes of palpitation. The symptom occasionally occurred in the past year without obvious cause. It lasted for a few minutes to half an hour and alleviated by itself. The last episode of the symptom was two months ago. The physical examination revealed a normal blood pressure (120/90 mm Hg) and a pulse rate of 160 beats/minute when the symptoms appeared. The 12-lead resting electrocardiogram (ECG) showed paroxysmal tachycardia and pre-excitation syndrome type B (Fig. ). He was given symptomatic treatment.\nThe man was 172.0 cm in height and 59.0 kg in weight. No significant injuries were observed on external examination except for a few old scars on the knee. The heart weighed 310 g on examination. The left anterior descending artery was located into the myocardial wall for a distance of 1.5 cm and depth was 0.1 cm. The coronary artery revealed no atherosclerotic changes. Focal hemorrhage was observed in the right ventricular myocardium. Other organs did not show any remarkable changes. The toxicology analysis revealed no positive findings.\nGenomic DNA was isolated from paraffin embedded tissue of the patient and whole exome sequencing was performed to analyze potential genetic variation related to WPW syndrome and SCD. The results showed no exonic mutations in the PRKAG2 gene. Seven potentially pathogenic mutations for SCD, KCNE1, CACNA1C, CASQ2, ANK2, AKAP9, KCNJ5, and TRDN were identified in the patient. The results of the genetic analysis are shown in Table ."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with diminished vision and redness in both eyes. She had a history of resected nodular melanoma in her right shoulder and was under vemurafenib therapy (960 mg/day) initiated at another center, though her family history was unremarkable.\nShe had 20/200 visual acuity in her right eye which did not improve with correction. Corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in her left eye. Both eyes had normal intraocular pressure readings. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed bilateral 2-3+ cells in the anterior chamber, posterior synechia, and pigment precipitates on the lens, all of which were more severe in the right eye. The fundus was not clear in the right eye due to cells in the vitreous. There were vitreous cells in the left eye; however, the optic nerve, macula, and the peripheral retina seemed normal. On fluorescein angiography, the right eye could not be visualized due to vitreal inflammation; the left eye was normal except peripheral vascular leakage in the late phases of the angiogram. The right eye could not be visualized on optical coherence tomography either; however, in the left eye the retina was normal, with clumps of cells in the posterior vitreous (). The patient was hospitalized for investigation with the diagnosis of bilateral panuveitis.\nThe results of diagnostic tests investigating possible etiologies were unremarkable. Systemic workup also failed to lead to a specific diagnosis.\nWhen the patient was questioned in more detail regarding her history, she reported she had had similar symptoms in the past which resolved with cessation of vemurafenib therapy. The patient was evaluated in the oncology department of our hospital and they suggested discontinuing vemurafenib. Oral prednisone 1 mg/kg, topical prednisolone acetate (hourly) and cycloplegic drops (three times daily) were started for both eyes.\nHer inflammatory findings subsided and the systemic and topical steroids were tapered. She has been under follow-up for 8 months and has exhibited no signs of recurrence of the uveitis or melanoma."
"A healthy 25-year-old man presented with recent visual acuity reduction in the left eye (LE) after a blunt ocular trauma he received the day before. Complete ophthalmologic evaluation showed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 in the RE and of 20/25 in the LE. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination of the anterior segment of the LE showed conjunctival hyperemia and normal pupillary reflex to light. The anterior segment of the RE was normal. Intraocular pressure was 17 mmHg in both eyes. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the LE revealed commotio retinae in the inferior quadrants, four subretinal macular hemorrhages, and two choroidal ruptures located temporally to the fovea. Fundus examination of the RE was unremarkable. The patient underwent imaging with fluorescein angiography (FA), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). On FA, choroidal ruptures (CR) were hyperfluorescent in the mid and late phases due to staining. Hemorrhages appeared as round hypofluorescent areas. SD-OCT scans revealed disruption of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-Bruch membrane (BM) complex associated with back-scattering effect. OCTA allows a depth resolved visualization of retinal and choriocapillaris microvasculature. On OCT angiograms, the choroidal rupture appeared as a hypointense break in choriocapillaris plexus (). At 4-week follow-up, FA was repeated and revealed leakage in the perifoveal area in correspondence of the CR. SD-OCT showed an hyperreflective lesion involving the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and outer nuclear layer such as hyporeflective subretinal fluid present next to the choroidal rupture. In the OCT-A enface scan, taken above the retinal pigment epithelium, a well circumscribed lesion with a clear hyperintense signal was observed. Lesion was characterized by numerous and fine anastomotic vessels with a well-shaped peripheral arcade (). Superficial and deep retinal vasculature were spared. Diagnosis of choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) secondary to choroidal rupture was done. After a written consent was signed by the patient, an off-label intravitreal injection of Bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 ml) was administered in his LE. At 6-week post injection, visual acuity has improved to 20/20. OCTA documented the closure of CNV (). C-scans of the outer retina and choriocapillaris did not show any hyperintense signal. SD-OCT revealed RPE wound healing process as lesion covered by a less hyperreflective layer of RPE. This layer was less hyperreflective than normal RPE."
"The patient was a 25-year-old male presenting with altered mental status and generalized tonic clonic seizures following a 2-week history of an upper respiratory tract infection. MRI of brain was negative for any acute pathology and nonlesional for seizures. Results of a paraneoplastic antibody panel were negative but he was found to have neutrophilic pleocytosis on lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative but he was empirically treated for bacterial and viral meningoencephalitis with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and acyclovir. Seizures began increasing in frequency despite frequent treatment with benzodiazepines and, on day three, the patient worsened to have status epilepticus. Treatment with maximal doses of valproate, levetiracetam, and propofol was started but, by day four, the patient's seizures remained refractory. As a result, the patient was placed under a pentobarbital-induced coma with burst suppression pattern on electroencephalography (EEG). On day 8, five days after status and due to continued seizure activity as evidenced by EEG, a VNS was implanted. VNS was turned on with the settings: Output output current 1.5 milliamperes, Pulse Width 500 microseconds, Frequency 30, On time 30 seconds, and Time interval 3 minutes.\nMagnet Output current 2 milliamperes, On time 60 seconds. Three days after implantation of VNS, there was generalized suppression of EEG activity with continued use of pentobarbital; however, the patient continued to have electrographic seizures which were successfully aborted by the VNS magnet swiping (see . No other changes were made to the medical regimen. For the next 72 hours, no status epilepticus or electrographic seizures were reported, although few occasional discharges were seen. Unfortunately, seizures recurred on day 14 and the patient succumbed to his multiple comorbidities on day 17. However, VNS was successful in acutely terminating status epilepticus for 72 hours in this critically ill patient when the standard therapies failed."
"A 25-year-old female with a history of sickle cell disease (on prophylactic penicillin VK) and venous thromboembolic disease (on oral anticoagulation with apixaban) presented to the emergency department with one week of right-sided neck pain and subjective fevers, and a one day history of trismus. Physical examination revealed warmth, swelling and tenderness to the right lateral neck near the angle of the mandible, with associated mild trismus (). Additional history revealed the presence of bilateral, subclavian, implanted venous access ports. We ordered a computed tomography (CT) of the neck with intravenous (IV) contrast ()."
"Patient 1: A 25-year-old male underwent total gastrectomy including a D3 lymph node dissection for advanced gastric carcinoma, preoperatively staged as T3 (SS), N0, M0, cStage II. Peritoneal lavage showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Class V). Pathological diagnosis showed the depth of invasion was T2 (invading the muscularis propria). He received adjuvant chemotherapy, biweekly paclitaxel for one year and oral administration of S-1 (TS-1; tegafur, gimeracil, oteracil potassium). At 13 years after resection, there is no evidence of recurrence."
"Patient 7 was a 25-year-old woman with an 8-year history of ES. MRI revealed no evidence of lesions at the time of enrollment. She had a history of IS at the age of 5 months, at which time MRI revealed subdural effusion. Following drill drainage, she remained seizure-free until the age of 17 years. Scalp EEG revealed sharp waves and complexes mainly over the bilateral frontal–temporal regions . Two types of seizure were captured by ictal video-EEG: (a) seven episodes of ES, which presented as slight nodding, with typical ictal EEG patterns for ES; (b) one episode of ES followed by a tonic seizure, which presented as sudden, slight nodding and stiffness of the neck for several seconds, with EEG showing spike rhythms following a typical ES pattern .\nMean seizure frequency at baseline was 18.10 ± 7.05 times per day. She was taking sodium valproate, clonazepam, zonisamide, and lamotrigine. The patient underwent two blocks of tDCS treatment at 2 mA. Mean seizure frequency was 14.81 ± 4.20 and 12.15 ± 4.00 times per day during the first and second follow-up, respectively . As Patient 7 underwent two tDCS blocks without achieving a 50% reduction in seizure frequency, she was not identified as a positive responder."
"A 25-year-old female was admitted into a partial psychiatric hospital program after a short stay in the behavioral health unit of a community hospital. She initially presented to the emergency department due to recurrent depression, mood swings, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts/intent. Upon initial evaluation, she reported suicidal thoughts, sad mood, a low energy level, anhedonia, and feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, and hopelessness. She also admitted poor sleep, poor appetite, poor concentration, and recurrent episodes of self-harm. She denied any symptoms of hypomania or mania. However, she did admit to a history of mood swings and anxiety. She had several superficial lacerations on her forearms in multiple stages of healing consistent with self-mutilation. She told staff that she had been “cutting” since she was a teenager and had also tried to intentionally overdose as a teen. The patient had a long history of psychiatric conditions and had multiple prior psychiatric hospitalizations. She denied any history of physical or sexual abuse. She reported a family history of substance abuse, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. The patient was also diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with symptoms beginning in early childhood."
"The patient (IV.8, Figure ) was a 25-year-old male, born healthy at birth to a first cousin parents. He was the fifth born child in the family and was normal up to one and half years of age. Initial symptoms of the disease, as noticed, were as developmental delay, microcephaly, difficulty in walking due to spasticity, and speech delay. The MRI of the brain and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were not performed on the patient. A clinical examination at the age of 24 revealed hypotonia in the patient's hands, injuries due to skin lesions, mental retardation, microcephaly, a minor problem in walking, and difficulty in speech. Molecular tests for the Fragile X syndrome and karyotype were normal. There was no family history of mental retardation. Due to the current pregnancy of the patient's sister (IV.5, Figure ), who also was in a consanguineous marriage, the family requested genetic investigations, and we performed clinical Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)."
"A 25-year-old male patient, without comorbidities, who had been a cocaine user for 5 years had a sudden onset of generalized disabling myalgia (especially in the lower limbs) associated with recent frontotemporal headache, palpitation, dizziness, and a non-measured febrile episode; the patient had used cocaine at the night before symptom onset. The physical examination showed hemorrhagic suffusion, blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg and tachycardia of 110 bpm. The patient was initially treated in another unit, which did not have logistics to dose myoglobin, and also no records regarding the initial value of CPK. Initial laboratory examinations from our hospital admission until 5 days after the admission showed Serology for HIV, hepatitis B and C negative; Creatinine of 13.8 mg/dL; Urea of 259 mg / dL (Table ), and urgent hemodialysis was performed. CPK was 1731 U/L. During the hospitalization, the patient showed progressive improvement of both hemorrhagic suffusion and elevated BP. He showed improved diuresis and recovery of renal function in 13 days during hospitalization, and dialysis therapy was suspended. The final probable diagnosis was AKI secondary to cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis."
"A 25-year-old woman referred to a maxillofacial department. Her chief complaint was painless swelling in the buccal mucosa for about 2 years, which interfered with her dental occlusion. The lesion was about 1.5 cm and mainly soft on palpation (Figure ). Excisional biopsy was done under local anesthesia. The incision was about 2 cm and was inferior and parallel to the Stensen's duct (Figure ). The lesion was capsulated and completely dissected. The laboratory examination revealed an adipose tissue and a thin capsule surrounding the lesion and pathologic diagnosis showed an intraoral fibrolipoma (Figure ). There were no complications during and after the surgery and no sign of recurrence after 12 months."
"A 25-year-old male patient with a C6 fracture and dislocation (AO classification C1.2.4) was treated with skull traction following an unsuccessful manual reduction on the day of the accident (). After six-day preoperative preparation and traction, he had cervical spinal surgery for a C6 corpectomy, a C4/5-C6/T1 discectomy, and fusion of the C-spine using a titanium mesh cage. Radiographs indicated that the mesh cage was not well positioned postoperatively (). The patient was thus taken for secondary surgery to revise the plate and mesh cage (). A white purulent discharge from the surgical site was observed 30 days after the first operation. An oesophageal fistula at the level of C6 was confirmed by a gastrografin swallow test and laryngoscopy (). The patient was immediately taken for a thorough wound debridement; subsequently, continuous extensive irrigation was performed, intravenous vancomycin was started, and gastric decompression was done using continuous nasogastric tube drainage. Four weeks later, the results of three continuous cultures of bacteria were negative. After eight weeks, an upper GI endoscopy and a repeat gastrografin swallow were performed, and the irrigation and nasogastric tubes were removed. The patient reported no discomfort at three-month follow-up (Figures and )."
"A 25-year-old man sustained a crush injury to the left heel by a bulldozer. Lower extremity fractures were repaired at an outside hospital, and he was transferred to our facility for reconstruction of the resulting soft tissue defect. The wound was repaired with a free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap and a split-thickness skin graft. The patient was placed in an external fixation for a total of 6 weeks. The external fixator was modified with additional bars to keep the heel elevated as seen in patient 1. The hospital course was complicated by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and hematoma at the injury site requiring evacuation. The patient did well after discharge, and the muscular flap remained viable."
"We present a case of a 25-year-old primigravida who presented at 19 weeks and 5 days of gestation for an anatomy scan. She had declined genetic screening. An exophytic complex mass with cystic and solid components consistent with that of a sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) was found in the sacral region (Figures and ). The spine and brain anatomy was otherwise unremarkable. Pyelectasis was also visualized. No other abnormalities were found.\nAfter genetic counseling, the patient opted to have cell-free fetal DNA screening that was positive for Trisomy 13. Amniocentesis was performed to confirm the diagnosis. The karyotype demonstrated an abnormality of chromosome 13, including duplication. Microarray demonstrated a complex structural abnormality of chromosome 13 with large regions of copy number gain (13q11q22.2 size 56.2 Mb duplication and 13q32.3q34 size 15.5 Mb duplication). Alpha fetal protein from the amniotic fluid was normal (0.61 MoM)."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian male who was born to non-consanguineous Caucasian parents with a birth weight of 6 lb, 11 oz. has a history of short stature with growth consistently at the third percentile, hypotonia and delayed motor milestones. He was diagnosed with ASD (Asperger syndrome) at 10 years of age and had hyperlexia and symptoms of Tourette syndrome, specifically verbal tics.\nChromosomal microarray was performed on a research basis and the results were normal. After we identified a de novo KMT2A frameshift variant, c.7695_7696del (p.Glu2566Lysfs*14; Supplementary Fig. ) via WGS, he was clinically re-assessed at age 25 and diagnosed with WSS on the basis of characteristic facial features (Fig. ), history of generalized hypertrichosis, and history of growth and developmental delay, cryptorchidism, hypotonia, and ASD (Supplementary Table ).\nNeurodevelopmental testing, as part of this study, at 25 years, 3 months of age (Table ) confirmed previous diagnoses of ASD. He has developed good social-communication skills over the years, which contributed to an ADOS-2 score below clinical cut-off. However, based on overall clinical impressions he continues to meet criteria for ASD with notable difficulties being flexible in conversations, providing insight into others’ emotions, and understanding subtle nuances in social situations. Abnormality in speech rhythm, intonation and volume were also noted. This assessment identified borderline cognitive skills, low average adaptive skills, and average language and vocabulary skills. No concerns around anxiety, attention, aggression and emotional regulation were endorsed by parents or through clinical observation."
"Patient 1 (20–25 years old) presented with agitation. He was threatening, screaming, scratching, and spitting, and refused a conversation. He looked well-groomed (clothing, hair, dental status, cleanliness of skin and nails). The team, consisting of two nurses, a resident and a consultant psychiatrist, had the impression that the aggression of patient 1 was somehow undirected, i.e., not directed against certain persons and irrespective of the context. The perceived subjective and clinical aspects led to the assumption that patient 1 could suffer from an acute and potentially first manifestation of a mental disorder. He expressly refused to undergo medical examination and all offered treatments. The team tried many times to establish contact with the patient by calmly addressing him or offering him to sit down and talk, to drink something, or to retreat in a quiet room and rest. All of these attempts to de-escalate the situation didn’t have any effect. The patient was still agitated, threw himself against the ward door, thus bruising himself, or screamed at the staff. The team members thoroughly discussed the next steps to solve the acute situation.The involved staff members agreed that, in this situation, the legal conditions allowing the use of compulsory treatment and mechanical restraint were fulfilled and that, most importantly, every alternative had been exhausted. The team thus decided that, in order to prevent further harm to himself and others, compulsory treatment was the only available possibility. Because of the acute and dangerous character of the situation, the patient was then, according to the Mental Health Law, mechanically restraint, a blood analysis and an ECG were performed, and he received an i.v. medication. Legal procedures regarding the pursuit of the involuntary hospitalization and compulsory treatments including external medical review and a decision by a judge were initiated. The results of the analysis showed that the symptoms of patient 1 were caused by a severe overdose of L-thyroxine and an electrolyte imbalance due to anorexia nervosa. After a few days of intensive care treatment, patient l switched to outpatient treatment on another ward."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a painful flexion contracture of his right hand for four years. 10 years earlier, he had a motorcycle accident, injuring the right forearm. Following the injury, he had pain in his right forearm for several days, which improved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). He was asymptomatic and had no movement deficits after the medication. Over the next few years, he gradually developed stiffness in his right index, middle, ring, and little fingers with pain in his right forearm and increasing difficulty in using the affected hand. He was unable to extend his metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers. There were no constitutional symptoms like fever or weight loss.\nOn local examination, his right midforearm was tender, and no mass or swelling could be palpated. His right index, middle, ring, and little fingers were held in flexion, and passive extension of the PIP and DIP joints was grossly limited (). The pain was worse on passive extension of the finger, especially his index finger. Active and passive flexion of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers was unaffected. There was no motor weakness and no sensory deficit.\nA clinical diagnosis of myositis flexion contracture was made. Conventional radiography revealed a soft tissue mass with calcific spots. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-defined lobulated mass with a bright signal intensity (SI) on T2W. Internal septations and dark internal SI spots, consistent with calcifications and/or hemorrhage, were present midway on the lateral aspect of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon and partially involved the FDP muscle and extended to the intermuscular plane between the FDP and flexor pollicis longus (FPL). It was fed by an artery from the anterior interosseous artery, but it was not dilated ().\nThe patient underwent an excision of the mass. Surgery revealed a multiloculated red-yellowish mass, measuring 2 × 2 cm, which involved the FDP, but there was no neuromuscular involvement (). After excision, passive extension of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers was established before skin closure (). The final pathologic diagnosis was intramuscular hemangioma with the presence of thrombosis and a phlebolith (). Postoperatively, the patient could actively extend his right index, middle, ring, and little fingers. Full functional restoration was achieved approximately 1 month after surgery."
"A 25-year-old female was referred to our clinic with double vision and restricted right eye abduction. In the ophthalmic examination, both pupils were round and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact with the exception that the right eye was unable to abduct (Figure 1 , Figure 2 ). No nystagmus was detected and visual acuity was normal. Visual field examination revealed the enlargement of the blind spot and constriction of the peripheral fields. On fundus examination, bilateral papilledema with blurring of the disc margins was present.\nQuestioning her history revealed that the first symptoms were weakness and numbness in her lower limbs which had resolved spontaneously. Afterwards, she had developed an intractable headache associated with right gaze difficulty and diplopia and was referred from the emergency room to the neurology department. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed no pathology. After our finding of papilledema, despite the history of transient weakness in the lower limbs, the cause was firstly considered as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and lumbar puncture was planned. But because she developed fever and neck rigidity at that time, she was referred to the department of infectious diseases to rule out meningitis.\nThe patient underwent a lumbar puncture, opening pressure was 255 mm H2O and the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 85 leukocytes/μl. Her Rose Bengal test was positive and the CSF culture yielded Brucella melitensis and diagnosis of neurobrucellosis was established. The patient was treated with a combination of doxycycline, rifampin, cotrimoxazole, and dexamethasone for 6 months."
"A 25-year-old female was hospitalized with generalized abdominal pain, low-grade fever, rigors, lethargy, and vomiting. Her medical history was significant for Down syndrome and Moya Moya disease complicated by multiple strokes and intracranial hemorrhage requiring an external ventricular drain and subsequent PEG tube placement for enteral support one month prior to presentation.\nVital signs on admission showed sinus tachycardia at 130 bpm, a temperature of 101 F and blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg. Abdominal examination revealed a distended, diffusely tender abdomen with evidence of bloody brownish exudate at the ostomy site. Pertinent laboratory studies included: elevated white blood cell count of 21 × 103 /μL (normal 4 to 11 x 103 /µL), hemoglobin of 9 gm/dL- which was relatively decreased from a previous value of 12 gm/dL (normal 11.5-15.5 gm/dL), metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.25 (normal 7.35-7.45) and elevated serum lactate of 7.27 mmol/L (normal 0.5-1 mmol/L).\nThe patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for suspected sepsis and was resuscitated with intravenous normal saline and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A few hours later, she started to have coffee ground emesis with a subsequent drop in her blood pressure.\nThe abdominal plain radiograph showed a dilated stomach. This was followed up by an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast demonstrating a dilated distal esophagus and stomach with extensive stomach wall pneumatosis and portal venous gas concerning for acute ischemia, the PEG tube was displaced into the proximal duodenum (Figure -) with its tip at the point of caliber change (Figure -). Distal to the PEG tube tip, the third duodenum and the remaining small bowel were collapsed. There was no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.\nThe patient was diagnosed with iatrogenic anterograde gastroduodenal intussusception with the PEG tube acting as a lead point with complicating small bowel necrosis. Family members were counseled regarding the need for immediate surgical intervention. However, the patient’s family opted for comfort care measures. No surgical intervention was done and the patient was transferred under hospice care."
"A 25-year-old woman gravida 2 para 1 (G2P1) sent by the Maternity Department for an exaggerated bilateral breast enlargement at 32-week gestation. The first pregnancy went on well. There are no similar cases in the family. She did not show signs suggestive of systemic disease including systemic lupus erythematosus. The examination showed bilateral giant breasts with collateral venous circulation and trophic changes marked by the necrosis of the distal third of the mammary skin involving the nipple-areolar complex (). The histology of the biopsied ulcerative mammary gland was in favour of a subchronic inflammatory tissue without abscess. The biological search for autoantibodies like ANA, anti-ENA, and anti-dsDNA could not be done because it is not available.\nThrough this consultation between obstetricians and surgeons, a normal delivery was conducted after foetal lung maturation. Twenty-one days postpartum, a reductive mammary surgery was performed with nipple plasty (Figures –).\nAfter a short period of lymphangitis (), postoperative follow-up was normal. Cosmetic and psychological result was satisfactory after 18 months (); the patient does not want to get pregnant again, but we are following her up regularly to appreciate long-term evolution."
"A 25-year-old male, from China, born to unrelated parents was presented to the First People’s Hospital of Huizhou city, China. The clinical manifestations were spastic gait disturbance and vision loss (Table ). He was suffering from mild gait difficulties by the age of 5 years; the ambulation was unstable, and he could fall easily. The vision loss was reported at the age of 8 years, while the cognitive development was normal. He was born at full term by uncomplicated delivery. The neurological examination of the patient revealed ocular motility disorders, horizontal nystagmus, absence of the left pupillary light reflex, pes cavus, spastic paraparesis on lower limbs, exaggerated bilateral patellar tendon reflexes, ankle clonus, and positive Babinski sign, while no detectable defect was found in the finger-to-nose test, sensory function. The laboratory biochemical studies of full blood count, liver function, plasma electrolytes, thyroid function, vitamin B-12 and folate, sex hormone, autoantibody profile and syphilis serology exhibited typical levels. Cerebrospinal fluid tests revealed increased protein (1186 mg/L); the normal value was 140–450 mg/L. The GALC enzymatic activity [] detected by Bio-Tek FLx 800 fluorescent analyzer in leukocytes was decreased (3.9 nmol/mg/17 h); the normal value was 18–75 nmol/mg/17 h protein.\nThe described findings gave reason to perform molecular analysis of the GALC gene. The direct sequencing of the GALC gene (Reference mRNA sequence: NM_000153) in this patient identified a novel missense mutation (c.865G > C: p. G289R) in exon 8 along with a known missense mutation [] (c.136G > T: p. D46Y) in exon 1 (Figs. and ). The former mutation was heterozygous in the mother, while the latter was heterozygous in the father.\nBrain MRI revealed a high-intensity signal in the left central gyrus cortex by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) as well as T2-weighted images, while a decreased signal in the T1-weighted images and high-intensity lesions in the bilateral corticospinal tracts were detected (Fig. ). Cervical spine and thoracic spine MRI showed mild atrophy of the spinal cord (Fig. ). Moreover, electromyography indicated peripheral nerve demyelination, and both visual evoked potentials (VEP) and brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) were normal."
"Case 1: A 25-year-old male with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and baseline respiratory function as per Table , using nocturnal NIV and mouthpiece intermittent positive pressure ventilation (MIPPV) presented to the emergency department with right-sided chest pain and dyspnoea. The evening prior to onset of symptoms, he reported using MIPPV for 10 h. He then completed five cycles of MI-E (pressures +50 cm of water (cmH2O) for insufflation, −47 cmH2O for exsufflation) to clear excess saliva. He went to bed on NIV via total face mask (settings per Table ) and upon waking four hours later, noticed sharp right-sided chest pain. The patient completed another five cycles of MI-E; however, this worsened his symptoms, prompting emergency department presentation.\nOn presentation, the patient was tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min. All other vital signs, including pulse oximetry were within normal limits. Initial arterial blood gases were unremarkable. Chest radiograph performed in the emergency department revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax (Fig. ) and a pigtail intercostal catheter (ICC) was inserted and placed on −10 cmH2O suction. Repeat chest radiograph two hours later demonstrated poor re-expansion of the right lung. The suction was increased to −20 cmH2O, resulting in good re-expansion on subsequent imaging. The patient used NIV on usual settings continuously throughout this period. The ICC was removed on the third day of admission and the patient was discharged on day five with advice to cease all MI-E until clinical review in two weeks.\nThe MI-E pressures were decreased to +25 cmH2O insufflation and −40 cmH2O exsufflation by a physiotherapist at this review, with instructions to use sparingly for cough augmentation or saliva clearance only. Pharmacological modalities of saliva management were recommended; however, the patient had no success with these previously.\nUnfortunately, this patient represented on three occasions (total of four presentations) with right-sided pneumothorax in the following six months. Bedside chemical pleurodesis was conducted on two occasions (iodine and alcohol/iodine, respectively), both failing to prevent recurrence. The patient was discharged home with a long-term pleural catheter after the fourth admission, which was removed two months later. The patient continues to use MI-E sparingly and has had no subsequent recurrence."
"A 25-year-old female patient of Indian descent presented with verrucous hyperpigmented neoformations in the right hemibody at the level of the trunk, abdomen, back, genitals, groin, and leg, sparing the face, neck, and mucous membranes (Figures -). The lesions described presented at birth and progressively increased in size and thickness. The patient's personal history was unremarkable, and maternal history was positive for a circumscribed epidermal verrucous nevus in the left forearm. After birth and subsequently during early infancy, routine blood and urine lab tests, neonatal and auditory screening tests, brain tomography scan without contrast and a skull X-ray were performed, all without pathologic findings. Psychomotor development was normal in all stages of life. The lesions remained asymptomatic during early childhood; however, as the lesions grew in size and became pedunculated, erosions and traumatic detachment occurred. At age 15, the patient received treatment with electrofulguration and CO2 laser treatments in a small area of the abdomen, with scarring and an unaesthetic appearance (Figure ). The patient did not receive any more treatments due to the unwanted results and is asymptomatic to date. Physical examination at the time of presentation showed no abnormalities, other than the lesions previously described."
"A 25-year-old male personal trainer ran a ‘fun run’ on a hot day wearing a heavy costume. He collapsed 9 km into the run and was brought to hospital. He was agitated and confused (Glasgow Coma Scale score 10; E3, V3, M4), feverish (40.5°C) and tachycardic (149 bpm) with muscle pain and weakness. He was cooled and given intravenous fluids. Investigations showed serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration was 3000 IU/L, rising to 105 000 IU/L at 24 hours, with an acute kidney injury and myoglobinuria. He was discharged 3 days later with no neurological deficit and normal renal function; his CK normalised after 3 weeks. He was an athletic man who had completed several marathons, with no medical conditions or family history of neuromuscular disease."
"This 25-year-old primigravida woman with a history of childhood asthma and generalised anxiety disorder was admitted to a cardiology ward unit with progressive dyspnoea at 26 weeks of pregnancy. Her ECG revealed several abnormalities (), and echocardiography showed a DCM with severe left and right ventricular dilatation and a left ventricular ejection fraction of about 10%–15% (). She underwent emergency caesarean section the following day and was admitted to the ICU afterwards, where she was treated with heart failure medication and inotropes. Low-molecular-weight heparins were started because of a thrombus in the right ventricular outflow tract. ECMO was started due to refractory cardiogenic shock, and later a left ventricular assist device was implanted. There was no evidence of coronary artery disease. Due to severe confusion and drowsiness in the ICU, a CT of the brain was made, showing generalised brain atrophy. Therefore, a metabolic origin was suspected. Myocardial biopsy showed a myopathic image suspected for mitochondrial storage disease due to excessive glycogen storage. Morbus Pompe and Fabry were ruled out and viral tests were negative, as were autoimmune and paraneoplastic syndromes. Quadriceps femoris muscle biopsy showed a myopathy without specific characteristics. Blood and urine tests were performed, as well as genetic tests. Plasma carnitine was strongly elevated and a diagnosis of succinyl-CoA ligase deficiency was suspected, but could eventually not be confirmed as the results of further tests and analyses were inconclusive. No known mutations in the DCM genes were found, and the diagnosis of PPCM remained the working diagnosis. Her prematurely born son was diagnosed with (congenital) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. One year later, the patient underwent a cardiac transplantation and is currently doing relatively well."
"A 25-year-old male with a two-year history of ileocolonic CD had maintained clinical remission for two years with azathioprine. Three weeks before the visit, he developed cramping abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His leukocyte count was 6500/μL, C-reactive protein (CRP) was 1.5 mg/dL (<0.6), and Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI) was 350. He had smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day for five years. A CT enterograph revealed mucosal thickening, enhancement of the terminal ileum, and focal narrowing of the distal ileum without proximal dilatation. A colonoscopy revealed active longitudinal ulcers in the terminal ileum with multiple scars. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) was initiated with daily azathioprine. Endoscopic biopsies and blood sampling were conducted before the first infusion of infliximab. Two weeks later, his CDAI had decreased to 120, and maintenance with infliximab was planned. Will he have a well-sustained response to infliximab?\nBetween 20% and 30% of IBD patients are refractory to any given medication, despite optimal dose and duration. Besides response, treatment side effects and toxicity are also variable. The need to predict the response to therapy is as pressing as the need to predict the disease course in IBD and will become even more important as more classes of therapeutics become available (e.g., anti-TNF agents, cell adhesion molecule inhibitors, anti-IL-12/23 agents, and other small molecules). Some clinical factors (e.g., concurrent use of immunomodulators, age, smoking, disease duration and location) have been identified but were not sufficiently reliable for predicting response to anti-TNF agents [,,,]. To date, also no clear associations exist to justify the use of serological markers in the prediction of the response to (anti-TNF) therapy in clinical management [,,]."
"A 25-year-old pregnant woman presented for her first prenatal appointment to the outpatient Department of Obstetrics at 22 week gestation. She was primigravida (G1P0) and reported an uneventful pregnancy prior to that point. She had not had any previous ultrasounds. Obstetric examination failed to detect a fetal heartbeat. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed nuchal lymphatic hygroma of about 62 × 99 × 103 mm and hydrops fetalis (Fig. a). Additionally, substantial pleural effusion and abdominal fluid of the fetus were also observed (Fig. b). Furthermore, the pregnancy was also complicated by oligohydramnios (AFV 11 mm). Upon inducing labor, a stillborn female baby was delivered at 22 weeks and 2 days of gestation, which weighed 600 g and the crown to heel measurement was 27 cm long (50th centile). Autopsy data showed a huge nuchal cystic hygroma measured at 10 × 10 × 6 cm (Fig. c, d), including 1000 ml of light red fluid, along with pathognomonic edema of the whole body. Partial, cutaneous syndactyly involving digits 2–5 of the fingers and toes were also observed on autopsy but, unfortunately, were not photographed clearly and radiographs were not performed. In addition, pathological examination revealed severe placental chorioamnionitis (Fig. f, g). Of note, no structural anomaly was found in the heart, lungs and kidneys. Chromosomal karyotype analysis of the fetal tissue showed monosomy X (45,X) (Fig. h)."
"A 25-year-old African American woman presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of generalized nonpruritic maculopapular rash. The rash was initially confined to the right antecubital fossa but spread diffusely across the entire body over the course of 2 days. The patient had no other complaints and was otherwise in her usual state of health. The patient had started taking azithromycin 5 days prior to admission for a tooth extraction. She was not taking any other medication. There was no history of any recent illnesses or sick contacts. Vitals were within normal limits. Skin examination was significant for generalized petechiae and ecchymoses sparing her head and face. The patient did not have signs or symptoms of major bleeding.\nLaboratory workup upon admission revealed an isolated thrombocytopenia with a platelet level of 2,000/μL (normal range: 150–400 K/µL). Repeat platelet count was 3,000/μL, and the same value resulted when using a citrated tube. The hemoglobin was within the normal range at 12.3 mg/dl (normal range: 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL). Prothrombin time was increased with an elevated INR. A positive ANA and elevated ESR were found. Quantitative c-ANCA, p-ANCA, C3 Level, C4 Level, lupus anticoagulant, and dsDNA antibodies were measured and found to be within normal limits. Viral serology for hepatitis, HIV, CMV, and EBV was negative. Blood culture was negative for bacterial infection. A blood smear was performed and ruled out drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy. Bone marrow core biopsy and aspirate smears showed increased megakaryocytes, myeloid cell hyperplasia, and left-shifted myeloid maturation. There were no sideroblasts or increase of blasts, lymphocytes, or plasma cells. Flow cytometry of bone marrow revealed no significant immunophenotypic abnormalities.\nAzithromycin was discontinued. Dexamethasone 40 mg IV daily and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy were administered. Platelet counts improved to 17,000/μL over the following 10 days. Gradually, over three months, platelet counts returned within the normal range. Drug-dependent anti-platelet antibody testing was not done during admission as the patient's platelet count began to slowly improve after stopping the azithromycin."
"A 25-year-old African-American male with a history of diabetes presented to our emergency department (ED) with eye irritation, painful mouth sores, and difficulty swallowing. Three weeks prior to this visit, he was seen at a local ED for a small abscess on the posterior neck and treated with a 10-day course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). He did not begin this antibiotic for three days and took it intermittently over the next three weeks. He returned to the local ED two weeks after the first visit for symptoms of sore throat and lip swelling. This was attributed to a food allergy, and he was discharged with a five-day course of prednisone. He returned to the same institution two days later with worsening lip swelling and new mouth sores. He was prescribed nystatin suspension for presumed oral candidiasis that he took with the prednisone and remaining TMP-SMX for two days prior to arriving at our ED.\nHe arrived at our institution with two remaining tablets of TMP-SMX and complaining of worsening lip swelling, mouth sores, eye irritation, and difficulty swallowing over the two days since his last visit to the local ED. Vital signs on presentation were a temperature of 38.6 degrees Celsius, blood pressure 132/73 millimeters of mercury, heart rate 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry 99% on room air. His review of systems was positive for odynophagia, sore throat, and eye irritation; negative for cough, rash, joint pain, or genital irritation. Physical examination showed injected conjunctiva bilaterally with sloughing (); visual acuity was intact. The mouth and pharynx had severe stomatitis with ulcers involving the lips, tongue, buccal mucosa, and oropharyngeal mucosa (). There were no skin rashes and the lesion on his neck was well healed. All images were taken and published with the express, written consent of the patient.\nLaboratory investigation revealed negative gonococcus/chlamydia polymerase chain reaction and negative M. pneumoniae immunoglobulin M on immunofluorescence assay. He was treated with intravenous (IV) fluids and admitted to the hospital for ophthalmologic and dermatologic consultations. The previously prescribed TMP-SMX was discontinued. He received IV methylprednisolone and mixed medication mouthwash for his stomatitis. The mild conjunctival sloughing was treated with erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, prednisolone acetate ophthalmic drops, and artificial tears, but did not require amniotic membrane graft. He was discharged after two days on a prednisone taper, prednisolone ophthalmic drops, and erythromycin ophthalmic ointment."
"25-year-old female: the patient has had two BCCs, the first at the age of 22 years. Genetic testing using panel-based NGS of germline DNA identified a 1-bp deletion (c.954del) in SUFU. The patient had frontal bossing and mild delayed mental development. A recent MRI of the cerebrum showed no meningiomas and the patient was otherwise healthy."
"A 25-year-old female presented to our orthopaedic hospital with an 8 year history of\narthralgia in the right hip. Under an initial diagnosis of ONFH, she had visited the\nDepartment of Orthopedic Surgery of Sapporo Medical University Hospital. She had no\nhistory of trauma, corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse, or other condition related to\nosteonecrosis. On admission, her range of hip motion was slightly restricted and\nother physical examinations were nonspecific."
A 25-year-old male deaf patient was admitted in emergency department with complaint of abdominal pain and unable to communicate anything of his clinical history. Physical examination was normal except an epigastric tenderness. Laboratory results were normal. Direct radiography revealed a circular shaped metallic object in stomach and other several metallic objects in gastrointestinal tract (A). An emergent gastrointestinal endoscopy was planned and during the procedure a wristwatch in the stomach was diagnosed and successfully removed with an esophageal overtube approach under direct endoscopic vision (B).
"A 25-year-old male presented with talon cusps in all upper anterior teeth. Despite the name, talon cusps in both central incisors presented as heart-shaped tubercles rather than talon shape. However, lateral incisors and canines have the typical talon shape appearance ().\nDeep carious grooves separate the heart-shaped tubercles in both central incisors from the palatal surfaces of the teeth. Meanwhile, in the lateral incisors and canines, the grooves are not deep and not carious and the tubercles are in close proximity to the palatal surfaces. However, grooves in the lateral incisors are darkly stained.\nAll anterior teeth except the left central incisor have responded normally to the sensibility test. The left central incisor has no response to the sensibility test and shows discoloration ().\nThe tubercles have been measured mesiodistally (MD) and incisogingivally (IG), and accordingly, talon cusps have been classified following Hattab et al.'s classification [] (). Proclination of anterior teeth in this case occurs due to occlusal interference of the tubercles with the lower teeth. This proclination makes teeth at risk of trauma (Figures –).\nDental variations like dens invaginatus in the upper left central incisor () and taurodontism in posterior molars () are associated with talon cusps.\nOn radiographic examination for the left central incisor, radiolucency around its open apex has been noticed. It has been diagnosed as chronic apical periodontitis. Pulp pathology on the left central incisor may be due to one of two reasons. \nTrauma. As shown in Figures and , tubercle interference with lower teeth leads to proclination of upper incisors and makes them at risk to trauma. Proclination of the left central incisor is greater than other incisors, and this make it at a higher risk to trauma leading to pulp necrosis. Measurements of the tubercles revealed that the larger tubercle is located on the left central incisor, and this justifies why the left central incisor is more proclined than other anterior teeth. Dens Invaginatus. Radiograph shows dens invaginatus on the left central incisor. Risk of pulp necrosis is well known in teeth with dens invaginatus if early precaution is not considered."
"This is a case of 25-year-old G4P1021 diagnosed with an in utero fetal stroke at 26 weeks gestation. She had ultrasounds at 19 weeks and 23 weeks, which showed no anatomic abnormalities (see Figures and ). She presented to labor and delivery at 26 weeks complaining of vaginal spotting. Labor and rupture of membranes were ruled out; however she had a Category II tracing with minimal to absent variability. Ultrasound exam revealed severe ventriculomegaly, a left-sided frontal porencephalic cyst, enlarged 4th ventricle, mild abdominal ascites, open hands, and echogenic bowel (see Figures and ). A thrombophilia panel, antiphospholipid panel, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis antibodies, and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia panel were ordered and were negative. She went into spontaneous preterm labor at 26 weeks 4 days' gestation and delivered a female infant, weighing 895g with APGARS of 1, 1, and 1, at 1, 5, and 10 minutes of life. Heart rate was in the 60s and abnormal rigid tone was noted. Intubation did not improve saturations (never over 60% despite correct placement confirmed), and chest x-ray showed bilateral whited out lungs. Compressions and chest tube placement did not yield improvement. Umbilical vein catheterization was unsuccessful and surfactant and epinephrine were given via the endotracheal tube. Despite extensive resuscitative efforts, there was no improvement in the clinical status, and the mother opted to switch to comfort care. Vesicular lesions were noted on the infant, which were positive for HSV2 by PCR (see ). A postmortum ventricular tap was performed and cerebral spinal fluid was also positive for HSV 2.\nHer first clinically documented HSV outbreak was immediately prior to pregnancy and she was treated with acyclovir. She became pregnant approximately 5 weeks later. A 6-week ultrasound confirmed those dates. She was seen for her initial prenatal exam at 11 weeks, which confirmed a positive HSV-2 IgG. She had no further outbreaks during pregnancy, and her pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated. She was not on suppression during her pregnancy, though it was planned for 36 weeks."
"A 25-year-old healthy male, who is right hand dominant, presented to our freestanding emergency department (ED) with right, third, fourth, and fifth finger trauma. The 3rd and 4th digits sustained partial amputations. The 5th digit sustained a complete fingertip amputation distal to the distal interphalangeal joint. The patient’s case was the result of helping his friend with a pet horse. The injury occurred from entangling fingers III-V in the reins of the horse before it began galloping away. The degree of bleeding was moderate and the patient reported moderate pain from the incident. There were neither exacerbating factors nor relieving factors. Aside from pain, there were no other related symptoms. Past medical and surgical history was negative; he had no drug allergies and denied any toxic habits.\nThe patient arrived with a makeshift dressing of his hand and holding the severed distal fingertip in his shirt pocket. The dressing was removed and the hand examined. He had an intact radial pulse, and the hand was overall warm and well perfused. He was unable to fully straighten his middle three fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joints. The exposed tendon was visible in digit IV (Figure ). The tip of digit III was twisted 180° such that the nail was visible on the palmar rather than the dorsal aspect of the hand (Figures , ).\nThe patient’s last tetanus was at age 15, and so he was given tetanus toxoid. For analgesia, he received 4mg of morphine intravenously (IV) and a digital block of fingers III-IV was performed using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. One gram of cefazolin IV was given as antibiotic prophylaxis. The severed part was wrapped in saline-moistened gauze and placed in a clean re-sealable plastic bag.\nA call was then made to the local trauma center, where he was accepted by the hand surgeon on call. On follow-up, we learned that the patient’s fourth fingertip was successfully replanted."
"A 25-yr-old Iranian infertile woman was referred to the Shariati Hospital affiliated to the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. She was a healthy young lady with the problem of 1.5 yr of infertility. She mentioned regular menstrual cycles with normal volume and duration of bleeding without any pain during or between the menses. She didn’t report any history of abortion or even pregnancy before in her first visit. A routine gynecological examination didn’t reveal any pathologic finding. Semen analysis of her husband was normal. Her lab tests and hysterosalpingography were normal. An ultrasound scan revealed focal echogenic shadowing lesions inside the uterine cavity.\nHysteroscopy under general anesthesia revealed that her uterus was filled with many intrauterine bone fragments with clear fetal features (Figures , ).\nThen, fetal bone pieces of 2–3░cm were removed by hysteroscopy. Samples were sent for pathology studies that show fetal bones and chronic inflammation.\nAfter the procedure, the patient confessed that she had an illegal abortion 2 yr ago at the gestational age of 15 wk. The patient was reminded that the previous abortion was not a complete pregnancy termination and this fetal remnant worked as an intrauterine device that prevented pregnancy occurrence. After six months, she reported her positive pregnancy test and after nine months she delivered a healthy newborn.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from patient."
"A 25-year-old male without significant past medical history presented to the neurosurgery clinic with worsening left shoulder and neck pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 2.6 x 1.1 cm intradural extramedullary mass within the left C2-3 neural foramen consistent with schwannoma. The patient underwent left C2-3 hemilaminectomy with complete resection of the tumor. The 2 x 1 cm dural defect was repaired in a water-tight fashion with suturable collagen matrix (DuraGen®, Integra LifeSciences, Plainsboro, NJ, USA) and covered by fibrin sealant (Tisseel®, Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA). There were no complications, and he was sent home four days later. On postoperative day eight, the patient returned to the emergency room with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, and photophobia that worsened when he was upright. MRI showed a large pseudomeningocele at the surgical site (Figure ) for which lumbar drain was placed. The patient’s symptoms returned after the drain was removed five days later. Therefore, the decision was made to proceed with surgical exploration and repair.\nA lumbar drain was inserted at the beginning of surgery. The posterior cervical incision was opened and explored. The 2 x 1 cm dural defect was localized, and suturable DuraGen® was used to repair the defect completely. A piece of fascia and fat graft were laid over the dura and covered by Tisseel®. The 2 x 2 cm absorbable sponge from the extra-small BMP kit was soaked with 1.4 cc rhBMP-2 and laid over the top. The suction drain (Hemovac®, Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA) was inserted, and the wound closed in a standard anatomical layer fashion without any complications.\nThe lumbar drain remained in place and was open to drain for five days. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day six. He was followed clinically for 15 months after surgery. The MRI at 16 months post-surgery showed no evidence of recurrent tumor, CSF leak, infection, extraneous bony growth, excessive inflammation, or neoplasm (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to our out-patient department with progressive hearing loss and blocked sensation in the left ear for of one and a half months duration. There was no history of ear discharge, ear pain, vertigo and tinnitus. There was no history of nose or throat complaints. Past history revealed a history of left myringoplasty six years prior to presentation. Clinical examination of the ear revealed a smooth, soft epithelium covered bulge in the lateral one-third of the floor and posterior wall of the left external auditory canal which was sensitive to touch and did not bleed on touch (). Examination of the nose, throat and neck was normal. Systemic examination was normal.\nHRCT of the temporal bone revealed a soft tissue density in the lateral one-third of the external auditory canal eroding the posterior wall and extending into the mastoid bone impinging on the sigmoid sinus plate ().\nMRI with Gadolinium contrast of the temporal bone revealed a well-defined lobulated T2W hyperintense lesion () with partial suppression on FLAIR images which appeared mildly hyperintense on DWI images (), not showing post contrast enhancement in the left external auditory canal arising from the external auditory canal extending into the mastoid bone with scalloping with no obvious erosion in the left sigmoid sinus plate denoting the possibility of a benign cystic lesion. Pure tone audiometry revealed a moderate conductive hearing loss with an air-bone gap of 30 decibels.\nThe patient underwent left mastoid exploration under general anaesthesia. Postauricular incision with exposure of the mastoid cortex showed a well-defined sac with keratin debris in the mastoid which was originating from the bony cartilagenous region of the external auditory canal and eroding the mastoid cortex ().\nThe sigmoid sinus plate, mastoid antrum, dural plate and tympanic membrane were intact. The sac was removed in toto and sent for histopathological examination. The defect in the posterior external auditory canal was reconstructed with cartilage, temporalis fascia and periosteum.\nHistopathological examination showed the presence of keratin flakes and lamellated keratin and eroded fragments of bone along with fibro-collagenous stroma. Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium overlying fibro-collagenous stroma was infiltrated with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, cystic macrophages and multinucleated giant cells consistent with features of cholesteatoma ().\nFollow-up after three months showed a well-delineated external auditory canal. Post-operative HRCT temporal bone at three months showed a well-healed cartilage graft surrounded by soft tissue without any evidence of residual disease."
"In March 2016, after treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics, a 25-year-old male patient gradually experienced fever (39.8°C), with morbilliform rashes, facial edema, and generalized erythema (). Laboratory tests showed hypereosinopenia, liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury. Ultrasound indicated inguinal lymph node enlargement, while skin biopsy revealed exfoliative dermatitis. With irregular use of systemic glucocorticoid for about one month, which was starting with intravenous infusion of methylprednisolone 80 mg for one day and then 40 mg for two days, he gradually recovered. However, he was admitted to the Emergency Room of PUMCH because of severe ketoacidosis in May after discontinuing prednisone for 2 days. Laboratory analysis showed artery blood gas (ABG) of pH 7.064, plasma glucose of 42.4 mmol/L, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.8%, and fasting C peptide <0.05 ng/ml. Islet cell antibodies-IgG (ICA-IgG), glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD), and anti-insulin-associated protein-2 Antibody (IA-2Ab) were negative, and insulin autoantibody (IAA) was positive. Rubella virus-IgG (RV-IgG), RV-IgM, and CMV-IgG were found to be positive at that time. Insulin therapy was then prescribed. In January 2017, with fatigue for 1 month, he was referred to the Endocrinology Department of PUMCH. The thyroid function test indicated primary hypothyroidism with elevated antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (A-TPO), antithyroglobulin antibodies (A-Tg), and thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb). Thyroid ultrasonography showed diffuse reduced echogenicity. Therefore, a clinical diagnosis of HT was made. Fatigue was significantly improved with levothyroxine replacement therapy. No involvement of other endocrine glands was found in his readmission in January 2018."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred to the dermatology department of our hospital in June 2017. After taking oxcarbazepine for about 1 month, she suffered from a fever of 39°C, facial edema, and erythema gradually developing to the whole body. Laboratory tests indicated hypereosinopenia and atypical lymphocytes in peripheral blood. Elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicated liver injury, while the kidney was spared. RV-IgG, CMV-IgG, and HSV-1-IgG were positive. Diagnosis of DIHS/DRESS was made by the dermatologist, and treatment with glucocorticoid was initiated as the following: intravenous infusion of methylprednisolone (40 mg every day) for five days was prescribed and then oral prednisone. While the abovementioned symptoms faded, she presented to the emergency department because of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in October 2017. For further care, she was referred to our department in December 2017. HbA1c was 8.6%, with fasting C peptide and 2 h postprandial C peptide below detectable levels, ICA-IgG and IA-2Ab were negative, and GAD was positive with a low titer. IAA was also positive, with a titer of 22.22 IU/mL. After admission in our department in March 2018, thyroid function was normal with overtly elevated levels of A-TPO and A-Tg. Thyroid ultrasound showed inhomogeneous internal echoes with solid nodules."
"A 25-year-old male patient with a body mass index (BMI) of 50 kg/m2, admitted for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). On the second day, the patient was discharged home without any prophylactic anticoagulant. Two weeks after the surgery, the patients presented with dehydration and diffuse abdominal pain that progressed in severity over the last two days. Vital signs were as follow; blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and body temperature was 36.7 °C. Abdominal examination showed soft lax abdomen without tenderness. White blood cells (WBC) level was 11000, platelets count was 310,000, and prothrombin time was 1.6. Interestingly, computed tomography (CT) of his abdomen showed extensive porto-mesenteric venous thrombosis without evidence of bowel ischemia. The patient was conservatively treated with heparin and warfarin then discharged on follow-up with the primary physician.\nOur case series has been reported in line with the PROCESS criteria"
"A 25-year-old man presented with bilateral cataract. He underwent cataract surgery in the right eye with a femtosecond laser to correct astigmatism and implantation of a + 15.0-dioptre trifocal IOL (AT LISA tri 839MP, Carl Zeiss). The operation was performed by the author Dr. Li on January 16, 2018.\nDrugs were administered perioperatively following the standard protocol. Docking of the patient’s eye was performed; femtosecond laser instruments were used to perform anterior capsulorhexis and sequential nuclear division; a corneoscleral incision was made with a knife to strengthen the coalescence. Subsequently, phacoemulsification was performed uneventfully under a microscope.\nBecause of delay in shipping of the IOL package from another city, the IOL was delivered to the operating theatre only 30 min before the start of the operation. The outside temperature was approximately − 7 °C; therefore, the IOL package was warmed using a radiator at a temperature of approximately 35 °C for 15 min. Once the optical region was implanted in the eye, cloudiness was observed, which persisted throughout the operation. (Fig. a, b). Considering the possibility of spontaneous clearing, which was previously reported in an IOL of another brand and following consultation from an IOL specialist, the changes were monitored. Three hours postoperatively, the IOL became completely transparent, and the visual acuity was restored to 0.3 logarithm of the Minimal Angle of Resolution (Fig. c. At the scheduled follow-ups on postoperative days 1 and 3, no residual opacification or structural changes in the trifocal IOL (Fig. d) were observed, and the patient’s uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20."
"A 25-year-old Chinese Han woman developed persistent polyarthritis since the age of 6, involving bilateral joints of the hands and knees, and gradually developed interphalangeal joint flexion. At the age of 20, bilateral uveitis occurred and her vision gradually decreased. She had no dermatitis or fever. She denied family history of BS (Fig. f). A de novo heterozygous R334Q variant was identified in the NOD2 gene. Cyclosporine with prednisone had no effect for the polyarthritis and uveitis. IFX (3 mg/kg) every 8 weeks plus methotrexate 10 mg every week was given. Her symptoms were well controlled at a 6-month follow-up, and prednisone was tapered from 15 mg per day to 5 mg per day. Methotrexate was stopped due to gastrointestinal side effects, and IFX was reduced to every 12–16 weeks since then, but the disease relapsed at her last follow-up at 18 months (Fig. )."
"A 25-year-old female with no past medical or surgical history presented to the emergency department with a complaint of intermittent epigastric and abdominal pulsation sensation that she had been experiencing for the prior year. An abdominal aorta ultrasound showed no evidence of aneurysm or dissection, but a 3.9-centimeter, echogenic tubular structure was found in the distal abdominal aorta consistent with a retained catheter fragment ( and ). The patient reported that she was born premature at seven months at an outside hospital. Given her history and the ultrasound findings, there was high suspicion for a retained fragment of an umbilical catheter in her aorta. Vascular surgery was consulted. The patient was seen in clinic but was later lost to follow-up before further imaging and treatment."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a history of dull intermittent right flank pain of 1 year duration. He had no history of fever, dysuria, haematuria or weight loss. Clinical examination of the abdomen was within normal limits. Laboratory evaluation was normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed right hydronephrosis with proximally dilated ureter. A CT urogram to delineate the ureter made a diagnosis of retrocaval ureter with proximally dilated ureter which was confirmed at surgery (). Excision of the retrocaval segment with end to end ureteral anastomosis over a stent was done (). The patient's symptoms resolved at follow-up."
"A 25-year-old single unemployed white male, who lived with his parents, was awoken by a song by the psychedelic rock band ‘Animal Collective' playing continuously. The music, which consisted of instrumental and vocal components, appeared to come from outside his bedroom and was of equal loudness to the ambient surrounding. He heard the music in both ears in the absence of tinnitus, or any other otological symptoms. The song, which the patient had last listened to one month prior, had personal significance and initially evoked a positive emotional response.\nSix hours later, elements of the music began to fluctuate, such as the source location, content (songs began to merge, forming novel compositions), and controllability (the patient became able to control the music's characteristics). He also experienced a sudden onset of paroxysmal anxiety, tremor, and palpitations. Approximately one day later, he presented to A&E after becoming distressed by multiple unidentified voices talking to him in a derogatory manner, which were able to access and comment on his thoughts (see for timeline).\nThe patient did not have a history of neurological or audiological disease. He had a psychiatric history of recurrent depression since the age of nineteen, describing his mood as persistently low, with periods of deterioration without clear precipitants. He had trialled several anti-depressants with no significant improvement and had restarted Citalopram 40 mg ten days prior to the onset of MH. His mother had suffered from chronic psychosis for several years, requiring antipsychotic medication and several psychiatric admissions.\nHe reported a six-year history of excessive alcohol use. Over the preceding two years he consumed on average 80 units of alcohol per week, and described tremor, anxiety and paraesthesia upon abrupt cessation. He last consumed alcohol two days prior to symptom onset. He had a seven-year history of regular cannabis use, including high potency cannabis (“skunk”), which he had last used two weeks prior. He had also infrequently used the stimulant 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which he had last used one month prior and had experimented with the hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and Ketamine over a year prior."
"A 25-year-old old, multiparous, pregnant woman had an unremarkable pregnancy course until 38 weeks. Routine ultrasound scans at 24 weeks, 32 weeks, and 36 weeks exhibited normal findings. One umbilical vein and 2 umbilical arteries were observed during an ultrasound examination at 36 weeks. At all antenatal visits, auscultation of the fetal heart was unremarkable. At 38 weeks of gestation, out-patient fetal heart monitoring showed severe, prolonged fetal bradycardia, in which the fetal heart rate remained between 70 and 100 beats per minute for more than 2 minutes (Fig. ). The patient was admitted to hospital, and an emergency ultrasound examination showed a single umbilical artery. Given the results of the previous ultrasound examination, UAT was suspected (Fig. A). After informed consent was obtained from the patient and her family, we performed an emergency cesarean section. A female neonate weighing 2860 g was delivered, and exhibited Apgar scores of 10 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. During the operation, the umbilical cord was extremely torsional in 20 laps (Fig. B and C). One of the umbilical arteries show yellow dye and blockage of blood flow. With respect to the pathological examination of the umbilical cord and placenta, three umbilical vessels, umbilical cord excessively rotating with a recent UAT (Fig. D)."
"A 25-year-old female presented with seizures and a recurrent right temporal tumor that was diagnosed as an oligodendroglioma eight years prior, with no specific molecular analysis performed. Surveillance imaging was carried out and at recurrence, the patient was referred to our institution for a second resection. The histopathology of the tumor resected in the second surgery showed a glioma, NOS that was not 1p/19q co-deleted by FISH testing and IDH1 (R132H) was negative by IHC. Based on the anaplastic features and absence of IDH1 (R132H) mutation, the management consensus after review in a tumor board discussion was concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant temozolomide. Methylation profiling was initiated due to an unclear and challenging diagnosis. The tumor matched to the diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT) methylation class with a calibrated score of 0.99. The CNV plot showed an isolated loss of chromosome 1. With the change in diagnosis, the new consensus on management after re-review at the neuro-oncology tumor board discussion was surveillance imaging and observation with no adjuvant treatment being given. The patient and imaging remain stable over 22 months."
"A 25-year-old Indian male, without any past medical history brought by his friends to the ER had fever and irritability for a week. He became increasingly somnolent and confused three days back. At the time of presentation, he also had neck pain, stiffness, generalized weakness, and headache. Family denied recent travel, sick contacts, high-risk sexual exposures, and any recent gastrointestinal symptoms.\nPhysical exam reveals dry mucous, membranes, a stiff neck with decreased range of motion, and a positive Kernig’s sign but no obvious Brudzinski’s sign; pupils were 4 mm bilaterally equal and reactive to light. He was tachycardic and hyperdynamic but regular abdominal and extremity examinations were unremarkable; on neurological examination, he was lethargic but responded appropriately to commands, was oriented, and moving all extremities; he had unsteady gait. He had no rashes, petechiae, or purpuric lesions.\nLaboratory data showed WBC 3700 /micro L; procalcitonin was 28 ng/mL, CRP was 220 mg/L; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed protein 458 mg/dL, glucose <2 mg/dL, chloride 113 mg/dL, lactic acid 17.1 with CSF WBC count; 107/cmm, RBC 2750/cmm. CSF Gram stain showed Gram negative bacilli and culture showed Salmonella typhi; later blood culture also grew S. typhi.\nRadiological imaging of brain showed multiple hypo densities seen in the deep white matter of frontal lobe, occipital lobe, and left parietal lobe. He was diagnosed as a case of meningoencephalitis, and started on antibiotics. The patient’s Glasgow coma scale (GCS) worsened from 8/15 then to 6/15 and pupils became unequal and nonreactive. An ocular ultrasound was done to measure optic disc which was abnormal (5.8 mm) (Figure ), so a repeat CT brain was done which showed subtle brain parenchymal hypo density in both occipital lobes, suggestive of evolving ischemic changes, and persisting cerebral edema, diffuse hydrocephalous (Figure ) and patchy deep white matter hypo densities in frontal and parietal lobes; therefore an external ventricular drain was placed. The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation as well. Subsequently he developed ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) with carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Later on the patient underwent tracheostomy and successfully completed treatment of VAP and transferred to his home country after about four months."
"A 25-year-old-male was admitted in the Emergency of the Hospital de Urgências de Goiânia with the report of intake of foreign body and its impaction in the upper esophagus with five days of evolution. He was submitted to the higher digestive endoscopy on his hometown with frustrated attempt to remove in the same day of admission. He was hemodynamically stable and afebrile in the moment of his admission, having a normal arterial pressure, having 72 bpm and Sat02 94%. At the hospital, it was done high digestive videoendoscopy, where it was evidenced the presence of foreign body perforating the upper cervical esophagus ().\nThe foreign body was removed using endoscopic device and, soon after, the patient was submitted to the computed tomography, showing emphysema and perilesional inflammatory process, but absence of collections (). The hemogram showed relative and absolute eosinophilia of 18% and 1170/mm3 (reference values: 1-4%, 45-400/mm3), respectively. It was also done thoracic radiography with no alterations.\nThe conservative treatment was chosen with nasogastric intubation by endoscopy and antibiotic therapy (intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg each 12 h and intravenous metronidazole 500 mg each 8 h) during 10 days and semi-intensive monitoring. It was installed also cervical drain that drained clear liquid and without blood. He had good evolution and was discharged from hospital after 15 days of hospitalization. A month after he was in outpatient care without symptoms or complications"
"A 25-year-old woman presented to our center complaining of a sudden onset of right-side lower abdominal pain. She had undergone a thawed ET with two embryos 35 days ago following IVF. She had a history of right salpingectomy for an ectopic pregnancy 1.5 years ago. On physical examination, she was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 110/79 mm Hg and heart rate of 98 bpm. A physical examination demonstrated a distended abdomen with diffuse abdominal tenderness that was maximal in the right iliac fossa with rebound tenderness and signs of peritonitis. Her serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) concentration was 63,212 mIU/mL. Transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrated one intrauterine gestational sac, with an uneven mass measuring about 2.2 × 2.0 cm at the right adnexa (Fig. ). The crown-rump length of the intrauterine fetus was 1.4 cm, corresponding to a gestation length of 7 weeks (Fig. ). Ultrasonographic evidence of hemoperitoneum was present, with a large amount of free fluid within the pouch of Douglas (Fig. ).\nThe patient underwent emergency laparotomy that confirmed a ruptured right tubal stump pregnancy with hemoperitoneum. The ectopic tissue was removed and effective hemostasis achieved. The volume of hemoperitoneum was approximately 0.3 L, which was evacuated followed by peritoneal lavage. Histopathology of the tissues confirmed a tubal stump pregnancy. Medical treatment of progesterone and estrogen was used to prevent abortion of the intrauterine pregnancy. Regular prenatal examination was performed with no further complications during the subsequent pregnancy. A healthy baby girl was born at 38 gestational weeks."
"A 25-year-old, previously healthy Kuwaiti man was brought by ambulance to the Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital in May 2014 after he became unconscious. A capillary glucose value of <2 mmol/L was measured by the emergency medical service. He was managed in the emergency department with intravenous 5% dextrose infusion and recovered with no sequelae, after which he was admitted to the medical ward for further investigation.\nThe patient mentioned a 2-months history of recurrent episodes of palpitation, dizziness, light-headedness, and sweating and had recurrent visits to the emergency room in April 2014 with documented values of hypoglycaemia (capillary glucose value reached as low as 3.5 mmol/L) which improved after receiving intravenous dextrose infusion. Those symptoms developed usually late after meals and after prolonged hours with no carbohydrate intake and improved after eating. The episodes never happened immediately postprandial. There were no signs of seizures. The symptoms also improved after transient use of oral dexamethasone in high doses daily for several days in mid-April 2014 which were prescribed by an endocrinologist empirically to treat possible adrenal insufficiency. After stopping the dexamethasone, the hypoglycaemic episodes recurred.\nThe patient was previously healthy but did report an uncertain amount of weight gain and also a history of erectile dysfunction for 1 month that was not investigated and had not been treated. He had no previous surgeries. There was no family history of insulinoma or any other significant disease. The patient revealed that he took several different injectable anabolic steroids and growth hormone together with oral amino acids, and other tablets (fat burners) for bodybuilding in the previous two months. He denied knowingly using insulin or insulin analogues. The patient is single with 4 pack-year smoking history and works in a private company."
"A 25 years old lady P2+1, presented in the gynecology outpatient department with the complaint of abnormal uterine bleeding for the preceding one year. Her first two pregnancies were uneventful, both babies were alive and the last born was five years old. Her third pregnancy resulted in a missed abortion at 16 weeks followed by surgical evacuation of uterus at a private healthcare facility. She never experienced menstrual irregularity since menarche. After uterine evacuation, she was symptom free for a month or so. She then continued to have periods at regular intervals with variable intermenstrual bleeding. Bleeding used to be mild, painless and totally erratic. She never used any form of contraception. She went to different clinics for treatment. Her record showed that she had tried antibiotics, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tranexamic acid and progestogens but she could not get relief. She had a pelvic ultrasound done at a private facility which reported an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) within the uterine cavity; despite there being no history of IUCD insertion.\nOn examination, her vital signs were within normal range, however she looked a little pale. Her thyroid was not enlarged. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Speculum examination revealed healthy looking cervix and vagina. On bimanual examination uterus was bulky, anteverted, mobile and both lateral fornices were clear.\nTransvaginal sonography (TVS) was done by a trained sonologist. On TVS hyper-echogenic foci with suspicion of fetal bone were seen. The sonologist advised pelvic radiograph where radio opaque shadows confirmed her findings ().\nAs hysteroscopy is not available in our setting, so we planned dilatation and evacuation (D & E) under general anesthesia. The uterine cavity had a gritty feeling which was bony hard in places. Fourteen tiny fetal bones were removed from the uterine cavity with the help of sponge holding forcep and curette (). Bleeding was minimal and the procedure was uneventful. The patient was discharged after 24 hours of observation.\nShe was followed in outpatient clinic for six months and her complaints settled. Fetal bones were found to be the sole cause of her abnormal uterine bleeding."
"The patient, 25-year-old female, HIV positive since birth and on antiretroviral medication, presented with a history of bilateral lower and upper limb pains with progressive lower limb weakness leading to inability to walk. She had been on wheelchair/immobile for 2 years and had been to multiple institutions where radiographs showed multiple lytic lesions but with no definitive diagnosis and management. She presented to Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi for second opinion. On physical examination, the patient was normotensive, pale, and had finger clubbing. She had multiple soft tissue swellings and deformity involving the left elbow, left dorsum of the hand, bilateral knees and above the right medial malleolus. Laboratory investigations revealed normocytic anemia with Hb of 5.6 g dl−1, MCV of 85.5fl, red blood cell count, 2.3 × 1012/l, white blood cell count 11.4 × 109/l and platelet count 489 × 109/l. The CRP was normal. Renal function tests were normal with creatinine levels of 86 µmol/l. The viral load was undetectable and the CD4 count was 733.\nIn view of the multiple sites of bone pain and deformity, skeletal survey was ordered which revealed multifocal lytic expansile lesions with gross bony destruction and soft tissue swelling. The lesions resembled vanishing bone syndrome (Gorham’s disease) as shown in below. Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the proximal leg soft tissue swelling revealed sheets of plasmacytoid cells in keeping with plasma cell myeloma as shown in below. The patient was referred to a hematologist and further work-up was done. Serum electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG κ. Serum free light chain showed both κ and λ chains were elevated with κ 991 (3.3–19.4) mg l−1 and λ 43 replace_with (43 mg/l−1) (5.7–26.3). Serum Beta-2 Microglobulin was also elevated at 16269 ng ml−1 (670–2143). She was subsequently started on 28 day cycle, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone and analgesics on a weekly basis. Immobilization by bilateral above knee casts was also done with her pain subsiding and was discharged for follow up in the outpatient clinic. Follow-up skeletal survey after one cycle, two cycles and after four out of six cycles of chemotherapy and completion of radiotherapy showed progressive new bone formation in the affected areas with interval resolution of the soft tissue components. See below. No new lesion was seen."
"This is a 25-year-old woman, first child of healthy and unrelated parents. Her younger brother was described as unaffected. She was born at term, from an uneventful pregnancy and uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Birth parameters were normal. Psychomotor development and education were within normal limits. She recalled congenital contortionism (i.e., positive five-point questionnaire). At 3 years of age, the mother noted trigger fingers of multiple digits in both hands, and this was treated surgically at 16 years of age with complete resolution. She also requested ortodontic therapy for dental crowding and high-arched palate. No visual nor auditory troubles were registered. The patient suffered from constipation since infancy. At 14 years of age, she received the diagnosis of rectal prolapse. She always suffered from easy bruising and tendency to arterial hypotension. More recently, the patient requested rheumatological consultation for proneness to soft-tissue injuries and easy fatigability, although she did never complain of dislocations and fractures. According to the patient’s past clinical history, the rheumatologist requested medical genetics consultation for a suspicion of hereditary connective tissue disorder. At examination, she displayed normal upper limb span/height ratio, bilaterally positive wrist sign, bilaterally negative thumb sign, Beighton score (7/9) with genua recurvata, marked hypermobility of the fingers and toes, flatfeet, brachydactyly (due to shortened metatarsals—brachydactyly type E), of the 2nd and 3rd toes bilaterally, brachydactyly type D of the hands (i.e. shortened and broad distal phalanx of the thumbs), soft, doughy and significantly hyperextensible skin, absence of distrophic scars, palmoplantar hyperlinearity, mild palpebral ptosis and bilateral euryblepharon. Of relevance, no other close family members had brachydactyly. Heart ultrasound showed minimal insufficiency of the mitral valve. Bone densitometry showed reduced bone mass at the femoral head (T-score-1.7). Hand X-rays showed “swan neck” deformity of the interphalangeal distal joint of 1st, 2nd and 3rd left fingers."
"A 25-year-old female reported experiencing right knee pain for 2 months and had presented previously as a candidate for β-TCP block reconstruction []. Plain radiographs showed an osteolytic lesion in the distal femur, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the lesion extended to the subchondral bone. After diagnosing GCTB by needle biopsy, curettage was performed, followed by the implantation of a β-TCP block in the cavity. Two years and 5 months after the operation, plain radiographs and CT revealed an osteolytic lesion adjacent to the joint. Osteosclerotic subchondral bone adjacent to the recurrent lesion was preserved (). Curettage of the recurrent lesion was followed by another β-TCP implant."
"The patient is a 25-year-old woman of Han ethnicity who had upper abdominal discomfort and distension. The patient had no other symptoms and no previous history of other diseases. Gastroscopy revealed a mucosal protrusion of the posterior wall of the gastric antrum, with a slightly depressed central area (Fig. a, far view and Fig. b, near view). EUS revealed hypoechoic lesions (14.8 mm X 20.8 mm), with irregular boundaries and nonhomogeneous inner echo; the gastric wall was thickened and deformable, and the five-layer structure had disappeared. Enlarged lymph nodes were observed outside the gastric wall and hypoechoic lesions were associated with the lymph nodes (Fig. c and d). Repeated deep excavation biopsy along the central depression and histopathological examination (HE staining) revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation (Fig. e 200X and Fig. f 400X). Therefore, we considered the lesion to be tuberculosis, and we performed erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (45 mm/h) and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) (+) analyses, chest computed tomography (CT) (no obvious abnormalities), abdominal ultrasonography (ascites and some enlarged lymph nodes), an ascites test (exudate, ADA: 45 U/L), and colonoscopy (no tuberculosis or other lesions). The patient was diagnosed with gastric tuberculosis and tuberculous peritonitis and administered regular anti-tuberculosis drug treatment. One year later, the patient’s gastric tuberculosis and ascites had completely subsided. Based on gastroscopic examination, the gastric mucosal protrusion of the posterior wall of the gastric antrum had disappeared, and a white mucosal depression that resembled an ulcer scar had formed (Fig. g). EUS showed that the hypoechoic lesions in the posterior wall of the gastric antrum had disappeared, the wall of the stomach was thinner, and the enlarged lymph nodes outside the gastric wall had also disappeared (Fig. h)."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with a hypertrophic scar in the area of the décolleté, which had occurred after a scratch injury sustained during her childhood. External keloid excision was performed at the age of 15 years, whereupon a scar keloid formed again. We performed triamcinolone injections in three sessions and applied silicone patches, after which the scar texture improved significantly ()."
"The patient was a 25-year-old man with no history of head injury, tumor, or obesity. He presented with complaints of a watery discharge from his left nostril for 1 week. He reported that the nasal discharge was associated with a headache without fever. On physical examination, no other abnormalities were noted.\nThe head preoperative computed tomography (CT) of the patient showed abnormal density in the left frontal sinus and left sphenoidal sinus. Moreover, the brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) demonstrated bilateral enlarged lateral ventricles because the Evans’ index (EI) is greater than 0.3 (EI = 0.42) (). T2-weighted MRI showed meningocele in the left frontal sinus, hyperintense in the left sphenoidal sinus, partial empty sella, and Chiari I malformation (CIM) (). A Cine-MRI revealed that the flow of CSF was obstructed at the aqueduct and the outlet of the fourth ventricle."
"We report the case of a 25-year-old male medical student from the Caribbean who presented to our clinic with a single asymptomatic pigmented cystic lesion on his left posterior calf (Figure ). The lesion was tracked and recorded for approximately two years and has been gradually growing in size. The mass has never been drained and has never been infected.\nThe patient is otherwise healthy and has reported no fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting. As medical student in Antigua with decreased access to medical care, he decided to seek surgical intervention due to recent mild discomfort.\nFurther clinical examination confirmed a circumference of 1 cm for the cystic lesion. Physical exam revealed no fluctuance, pericystic erythema, or any tenderness to palpation. Excision was planned for one week after the initial consultation.\nThe procedure was performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia. The patient was injected with 4 ml of local 1% lidocaine with epinephrine subcutaneously surrounding the 1 cm lesion. An elliptical incision was marked and carried out to excise the cystic lesion in a single specimen piece. The entire cystic lesion was subsequently sent for pathological analysis. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\nThe pathology report confirmed an excision of tan-brown skin lesion, measuring 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. The cutaneous surface was remarkable for a central 0.8 x 0.6 cm gray-tan, slightly raised, firm nodule.\nHistopathological examination of the excised cystic lesion revealed a moderately cellular, poorly demarcated, dermal, fibrohistiocytic proliferation made primarily of fusiform to stellate cells with unvarying, oval nuclei and amphiphilic cytoplasm (Figure ), associated with intralesional pools of extravasated blood and peripheral collagen trapping. Multinucleated giant cells with peripheral cytoplasmic deposits of hemosiderin were also observed in a scattered formation (Figure ). A diagnosis of HDF was confirmed."
"Patient 1, M.F., a 25-year-old woman, had been treated with prednisone, cyclosporin-A (CYA) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) for SLE since 1991 and for Lupus nephritis (WHO class-V) since 1999. For the poor control of proteinuria (2 g/24h) with glucocorticoid therapy, she started in 2002 MMF (2 g/daily) with normalization of proteinuria levels. In June 2008, the patient complained of papulopustules and nodules on the vulva and in gluteal region () with open and closed comedones. Contemporarily, paronychia and nasal furuncle appeared. Culture tests of two gluteal open comedones and of the nasal furuncle were undertaken and demonstrated the presence of Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) at the gluteal level. Thus, treatment with doxycycline 100 mg/daily together with local mupirocin in the form of 2% ointment applied three times per day was initiated while MMF was suspended producing clinical improvement."
"Patient Two was a 25 year-old female with history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (achieved remission for the past 14 years) who presented with recurrent quotidian fevers, sore throat, generalized malaise and arthralgias, and a new-onset maculopapular rash of the inner forearms and thighs bilaterally for one-month duration. Her outpatient blood work revealed WBC 20.8 k/uL but further infectious work-up was negative. She was found to have negative RF, ANA but elevated ferritin level of 321 mg/mL, ESR 75 mm/hr, CRP 138 mg/dL. Patient was diagnosed with AOSD, and started on pulsed oral steroid with methotrexate outpatient, but failed treatment. Her Vectra DA score was 80 at the peak of her symptoms. She was referred to our inpatient institution for further management, and received pulsed IV corticosteroids during her course with symptomatic improvement. Patient was discharged home on a tapered steroid regimen and Rilonacept. A repeat Vectra DA score at three-month follow-up was 17, with ESR 6mm/hr and CRP 7.4mg/dL and, also, resolution of presenting symptoms."
"A 25-year-old woman, gravida 2 and para 2, visited her local hospital due to a pelvic mass discovered via health examination with no relevant past medical story, no abdominal discomfort, no complaints of menstrual disorder and no urination or defecation disturbance. She also denied a family history of cancer. Upon gynecological examination, a 7-cm mainly cystic component was discovered in the left adnexal area. B ultrasonography revealed a 7 cm*5.7 cm*3.9 cm increased left ovary with various cystic masses. The largest of them is 2.5 cm*1.8 cm. The serum levels of tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA199, CA153, CA125, and a-fetoprotein (AFP), were within the normal range. The serum levels of total cholesterol were 5.50 mmol/L, triglyceride 2.21 mmol/L, apolipoprotein 1.01 g/L, specific beta hcG 0.10 mIU/ml, E2 144 pg/ml LH 7.74 mIU/ml, FSH 2.14 mIU/ml, PROG 11.54 ng/ml, PROL 75.4 ng/ml, and TESTO 0.48 ng/ml. Based on the chief complaint and imaging results, the diagnosis was considered as an ovarian chocolate cyst at first. Laparoscopic left ovarian tumor resection was subsequently performed at the local hospital. During laparoscopy, the surgeons discovered a 7 cm*6 cm cystic-solid mass and a 2-cm cystic mass present on the left increased ovary, and the uterus and right ovary were unremarkable. Frozen section of the left ovarian mass demonstrated an ovarian sex-stromal tumor, mostly like an ovarian granulosa cell tumor. After discussing treatment options with her family to balance curative treatment and fertility preservation and receiving her consent, the surgeons in the local hospital finally chose left ovarian tumor resection. No further oncologic therapy was administered.\nThirty days after surgery, the patient visited our hospital and Peking Union Medical College Hospital for pathology consultation and was diagnosed with ovarian microcystic stromal tumors. And till now, 4 months after surgery, the B ultrasonography and serum levels of tumor markers are all within the normal range."
"An otherwise healthy 25-year-old single female presented with a 10-day history of itchy erythematous papules over the face, chest, and upper back, which started three days after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with no intra/post-operative complications. The patient was on daily multivitamin supplements (fusion chewable tablets), daily biotin, and vitamin D (50,000 IU, weekly for eight weeks). She denied taking any other medication or being currently on a ketogenic diet. The patient has lost 7 kg since the operation, and weight at presentation was 106 kg. There was a past history of a similar eruption four years ago, two weeks after following a ketogenic diet, which spontaneously resolved after resumption of her normal diet. Physical examination revealed multiple erythematous reticulated papules and plaques with hyperpigmented macules involving the face, the chest, and the upper back/shoulder (Figure ). A skin punch biopsy was obtained from the left shoulder which showed mild vacuolar basal cell changes with focal lymphocytic exocytosis and scale crusting. There was moderate superficial perivascular lymphocyte infiltrate with few neutrophils, eosinophils, and extraverted red blood cells. Histological features were consistent with the diagnosis of PP (Figure ). Considering the clinical findings in addition to the histopathology results, a diagnosis of PP was established. The patient was prescribed minocycline extended-release tablets (80 mg, QD for one month) and topical mometasone furoate cream (BID for one week). A four-week follow-up showed complete resolution of the eruption, with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old female with congenital HIV who was noncompliant with ART and had a history of multiple admissions for severe pneumonia was admitted to the medical ICU for severe community-acquired pneumonia. Her hospital course was complicated with Haemophilus influenzae bacteremia and a pleural effusion. Her pleural fluid culture revealed MAC, and her symptoms improved with antibiotics. She was restarted on ART and PJP prophylaxis. During the admission, the patient had a CT scan that confirmed bronchiectasis in the right upper, right middle, and bilateral lower lobes. Sputum culture grew normal flora. The patient was discharged and remained noncompliant with HIV treatment. She did not follow up outpatient. The next year, she had three more admissions during which she received empiric treatment for both community-acquired pneumonia and PJP. The following year, the patient was admitted for severe pneumonia with confirmed PJP along with positive enterovirus and rhinovirus. The patient initially improved, however, she then developed a stroke that was thought to be secondary to disseminated MAC with HIV vasculitis on the differential. Her blood culture grew MAC, and she was treated accordingly. The patient's poor clinical condition persisted, and she decided to suspend treatment and transition to comfort care."
A 25-year-old female presented with multiple discharging sinuses in the both inframammary areas that extends into the intermammary region for two years. Past and family histories were clear. She was non-smoker and single.
"A 25-year-old caucasian male, with no past medical history presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and cough that began three weeks prior to presentation. The patient stated his initial symptoms were congestion and dry hacking cough associated with yellow-colored sputum. The symptoms had progressively worsened, and he had only minimal improvement with over-the-counter medication. He denied fever, chest pain, and hazardous material exposure; however, he stated that he has been “dabbing” on a daily basis for ten years.\nOn presentation, the patient was afebrile (98.1F), tachycardic at heart rate of 121 beats per minute and saturating at 88% on room air. Initial laboratory results revealed mild leukocytosis with white blood cell count of 11.32 K/mcL with isolated eosinophilia of 3.03 K/mcL. Respiratory exam revealed diffuse wheezing, crackles, and rhonchi bilaterally. On hospital day 2, the patient developed audible squeaking of the lungs associated with sputum change from initial presentation to white pearl-like with dark specks. Work-up included chest x-ray which did not show any acute changes (Figure ). Computerized tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest showed multiple small-to-moderate polygonal foci of ground-glass infiltrates seen in all lobes, but greatest in the right upper and lower lobes (Figures , ). Echocardiogram revealed moderate systolic pressure increase in pulmonary artery, with an estimated peak pressure of at least 45 mmHg (Figure ). The patient was diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to chemical pneumonitis from BHO inhalation. He was treated with breathing treatments, oxygen with FiO2 of 36% via nasal cannula, empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and 125 mg of intravenous (IV) prednisone. The IV prednisone was converted to oral prednisone 30mg/day after the first dose."
"A 25-year-old female with history of surgical repair of coarctation in infancy and percutaneous device closure of a mid-muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) at age eighteen presented to our adult congenital clinic for routine follow-up. She stated that she was asymptomatic and had normal functional capacity. Physical examination findings were within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed normal heart size and an abnormal bulging in the upper left heart border suggesting aneurysmal dilation of thoracic aorta (Fig. ). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed for surveillance of the coarctation repair site and revealed formation of a large aneurysm in distal part of the aortic arch and proximal part of descending thoracic aorta measuring an anteroposterior diameter of 50 mm that also involved the origin of the left subclavian artery (Fig. ). Given the inherent risk of complications or rupture as the aneurysm had formed at site of previous surgical repair, we decided to have a lower threshold for intervention in this young patient. The patient refused any surgical options; therefore, percutaneous repair of the aneurysm by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) method was planned."
"We present case of severe heat stroke complicated by acute liver failure and rhabdomyolysis in a 25-year-old male after running 10 km in 28°C outside temperature presenting with syncope upon finishing the run. Paramedics on-site reported an initial GCS of 3, a body temperature of 41.1°C, and a blood glucose of 3.3 mmol/l. Cool packs were placed inguinal and 20 g parenteral glucose were administered.\nThe patient reported nausea and vomiting as well as a severe headache. His prior medical history was significant for an autism spectrum disorder, and otherwise unremarkable, he was taking no medication. The vital signs upon arrival showed GCS 15 with a tympanic temperature of 38.6°C, blood pressure was normal at 129/98 mmHg, and heart rate was 130 min−1. The patient was hyperventilating at a respiratory rate of 45 min−1 and peripheral oxygen saturation was 98% breathing ambient air. The physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nLaboratory findings are presented in . A urinalysis showed a leukocyturia and haematuria, and drug screen was negative. Leukocyte and erythrocyte casts as well as bacteria were present. An electrocardiogram and X-ray of the chest showed normal results.\nAfter rehydrating with Ringers lactate solution, the body temperature stayed high between 38 and 39°C. He received symptomatic therapy with ondansetron. As leucocyte casts were present in urine, we treated a possible urinary tract infection with ceftriaxon, and to counteract possible concomitant fever, paracetamol and also metamizole were administered. The patient was admitted to the general medicine ward for further observation and rehydration.\nOn the third day after admission, the patient showed a slightly better general condition. Laboratory examinations revealed acute liver injury with ASAT 6100 U/l and ALAT 6561 U/l. The CK level elevated to a peak of 15969 U/l with a slightly improved kidney function (). The virus serology for hepatitis B, C, and E as well as HIV was negative.\nAs our patient did not meet the Kings College criteria for emergency liver transplantation, he was not referred to a tertiary centre for emergent transplant listing. Liver and kidney injury resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation. The patient was discharged in good condition at the 8th day."
"A 25-year-old healthy male presented to a peripheral hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, after an MVA. He was an unrestrained passenger who hit the car dashboard after sudden deceleration from high speed. He sustained multiple injuries including bilateral hemopneumothoraxes. An admission transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed severe TR of unclear mechanism.\nHe was referred 2 weeks after the index admission to a tertiary hospital. On arrival, he was asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable. He had abrasion marks on the chest (). Cardiovascular examination revealed prominent internal jugular vein c-v waves and a soft grade 2/6 pansystolic murmur at the left lower parasternal border. He was not in heart failure. Sinus tachycardia and an early repolarisation pattern were noted on the 12-lead electrocardiogram. He had normal laboratory blood parameters. On TTE, a moderately enlarged right ventricle (RV) and right atrium, with preserved RV systolic function, was noted. There was a flail TV leaflet and an oscillating mass in the right atrium (). Avulsion of the anterior papillary muscle from the RV wall was suspected. The colour flow Doppler revealed severe TR with an early peaking triangular jet velocity of 2.16 m/sec (Figures and ). There was systolic flow reversal in the hepatic veins (). A 3D transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed which confirmed a flail anterior TV leaflet due to rupture of the anterior papillary muscle (Figures , , and 5(b)). On 3D colour flow, the TR was severe, with the jet filling greater than 50% of the right atrium ().\nThe patient underwent a successful surgical repair of the TV (). A flail anterior TV leaflet due to anterior papillary muscle rupture was identified with a residual papillary muscle stump on the RV. The anterior papillary muscle was reattached to the stump with pledgeted 4-0 polypropylene sutures. Additionally, a modified De Vega annuloplasty was done. Finally, the valve competency was tested by saline injection into the RV and confirmed by TEE after coming off cardiopulmonary bypass. Trivial TR was noted. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course."
"A 25-year-old male with a history significant for marijuana use, presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and occasional vomiting for two days. He was somnolent, though responsive, at the time of admission, with a heart rate of 36 beats per minute (bmp), blood pressure of 120/75 mmHg, and afebrile with oxygen saturation of 95 % on room air. The physical examination revealed bilateral conjunctival injection but was otherwise normal. Electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a junctional rhythm with a heart rate of 37 bmp and atrioventricular (A-V) dissociation (Figure ).\nThe serum metabolic panel was remarkable for undetectable phosphorus level (<0.5 mg/dL) (normal range 2.5 - 4.5 mg/dl) but was otherwise unremarkable with a normal renal function. The urine toxicology screen was positive for cannabis and opiates. Urine analysis was unremarkable. The patient was commenced on intravenous potassium phosphate 60 mmol bolus. A few hours later, repeat laboratory testing showed rapid correction of his phosphorus level to 4.3 mg/dL, which was out of proportion to the amount of repletion that he received. An EKG done on the following day showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 57 bmp (Figure ).\nA careful review of this patient’s previous admission for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome showed similar dynamics of metabolic profile, in which his undetectable phosphorous levels corrected very rapidly to normal within a few hours."
"We selected the case of a 25-year-old male with faecal incontinence secondary to congenital malformations and previous reconstructive surgery in infancy. The patient was born with anal atresia (absence of anatomical anal complex) and other associated malformations. After various surgical interventions, the patient recovered completely, but presented passive faecal incontinence with continuous soiling, reduced rectal sensitivity, and urgency which severely affected his quality of life. The patient had visited various hospitals referred from his paediatricians to consider the possibility of an anal artificial sphincter, or any other alternative therapy, without success. Now in adulthood, the patient was referred to the specialized clinic on incontinence and pelvic floor disorders of the Colorectal Surgery Department at Hospital Universitario La Paz for expert opinion.\nAfter revising past medical history and completing investigations, the patient was offered SNS therapy, which he accepted. The sacral malformation consisted of a dysplasia with a partial agenesis, with unilateral fusion of sacrococcygeal S4–S5 foramina and absence of coccyx, but with permeable S3 foramina that allowed for electrode insertion. The procedure was performed routinely with electrode placement in S3 foramina under local anesthetic with an intraoperative simple X-Ray (posterior-anterior and lateral projections). Electrode placement was challenging, and surgeons highlighted the importance of preoperative planning and how a better understanding of the anomalous anatomy could have improved and eased the procedure."
"A 25-year-old female came to our institution after noticing a rapid growing mass in her left breast for 16 weeks. She had no past medical histories and was at the week 25 of her first pregnancy. On examination, the patient was afebrile and there were two large masses on her left breast with diameters of 20 × 7 cm and 10 × 6 cm, which was ulcerated and bleeding (). A relatively fixed 2-cm lymph node in the left axilla was also noticed. On ultrasound, there were two heterogeneously echogenic lesions with irregular borders and fatty infiltrate, of which the diameters were about 10 cm and 20 cm respectively. Besides, several axillary lymph node with the largest diameter of 2 cm were found, but the fatty hilum was still present. The patient was anemic, with a hemoglobin level of 58 g/L.\nLocal dressing and pressure were applied to slow down the bleeding. Blood transfusion and prophylactic antibiotics were also indicated. The initial clinical diagnosis was cT4bN2M0 breast cancer. However, an open biopsy with local anesthesia was done which yielded the result of lactating adenoma of the breast. The tumor still significantly bled and palliative mastectomy was performed. During surgery, we found two large tumors which had unclear borders and spread to almost entire breast tissue but did not invade the pectoralis muscles.\nOn post-operative pathological examination, there were necrosis areas along with breast ductal hyperplasia. The epithelial cells exhibited secretory changes which had mildly hyperchromatic, round nuclei and prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles (). The final diagnosis was then lactating adenoma. There were no post-operative complications, the axillary lymph nodes shrank gradually after antibiotic treatment and the patient was stably discharged two weeks later. The pregnancy then went well and she gave birth to a healthy girl after two months. After two years of follow-up, there have been no signs and symptoms of recurrence or metastasis."
"A 25-year-old man with a past medical history of IV heroin use, presented to the ED by EMS after IV heroin use. The patient initially had CNS and respiratory depression in the field and was first given two mg of IN naloxone with no response, followed by a second dose of two mg IN naloxone, which made him anxious and tachycardic. Vital signs on arrival to the ED included a HR of 102 beats per minute, BP of 146/89 mmHg, RR 24 breaths per minute, SpO2 98% on room air, and oral temperature 97.5º F. Physical exam was positive for flushing, tachycardia, and agitation. The patient was given 4 mg of lorazepam IV in the ED. He admitted to the use of an adulterated heroin “Santa Muerte.” CBC and BMP were unremarkable. Urine drug screen immunoassay was positive for opiates, amphetamine, barbiturates and cocaine. Symptoms improved after benzodiazepine treatment, IV fluids, and supportive care. He was admitted for 24 hours and discharged the following day with no further complications. Laboratory analysis of the patient’s confiscated drug by GC-MS and LCQ-TOF was positive for the novel SC 5F-MDMB-PINACA, heroin, and fentanyl."
"A 25-year-old man presented to the hospital by EMS after IV heroin use. The patient was found with a drug packet labeled “Santa Muerte” in his pocket and had CNS and respiratory depression. He was given a total of four mg of IN naloxone, after which he became flushed, tachycardic, and agitated with dilated pupils. On arrival to the ED, his HR was 158 beats per minute, BP was 215/158 mmHg, RR was 26 breaths per minute, SpO2 was 99% on room air, and oral temperature was 102.1º F. On exam, he had urinary retention and anhidrosis. He was given four mg of lorazepam and two mg of IV physostigmine, which treated his agitation. There was also marked improvement in anhidrosis and urine retention. He was admitted for 24 hours and discharged the following day with no further complications. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, opiates, and THC. Serum comprehensive toxicology analysis by LC-MS-MS was positive for 5F-MDMB-PICA(5F-ADB), heroin, 6-MAM, and fentanyl. Laboratory analysis of the patient’s confiscated drug by GC-MS and LCQ-TOF was positive for the novel SC 5F-MDMB-PINACA, heroin, and fentanyl."
"A 25-year-old woman still had a broad lower face after type A botulinum toxin injection into the masseter. She came and asked for a slender lower face. She had no idea of the impacted teeth until the pre-op imaging examination indicated bilateral wisdom teeth impaction and right maxillary third molar impaction (Fig. ). The patient required simultaneous molar extraction after being informed that the horizontal impacted wisdom teeth could never erupt, and their growth would cause dental crowding and damage of the second molars. Simple mandibular reduction and extraction of the impacted teeth were performed together. The patient was satisfied with the result (Fig. )."
"In September 2019, a 25-year-old man from Tehran province, while fishing and camping in Namrood river in Harandeh village, Firuzkuh County, Tehran Province, Iran (35.7550° N, 52.7724° E) (Fig. ) was attacked by numerous Simulium flies at early morning. After few minutes, pruritic dermatitis with considerable edema appeared in biting sites on hands and legs (Fig. ). In the next few hours, the patient’s condition aggravated in reactions to blackflies bites by appearing swollen lymph nodes, joints aching, and 40 °C fever. The patient’s clinical signs and symptoms were alleviated by single injection of intramuscular Dexamethasone Phosphate (DEXADIC®) 8 mg/2 ml after 24 h after referring to an infectious disease specialist. However, the pruritic lesions completely healed after 10–14 days with no further treatment. Meanwhile, the interview revealed that the patient had no history of allergic diseases and had not yet experienced such condition.\nThe flies were captured on the skin during blood-feeding by the patient and kept in a capped container. All captured flies were brought to the Department of Medical Parasitology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences for further investigations.\nBy investigating the morphological characteristics, the collected adult blackflies were identified as the females S. kiritshenkoi (Fig. ). In the female blackflies, the eyes are separated (dichoptic). While, in the males, the eyes are close together (holoptic). Tarsus of the hind leg with calcipala, no hair at the base of radius vein, two silvery grey parts at the front of the scutum, the hairy pleural membrane, strongly beak-like process on the ventral plate of the genitalia, and red or reddish-orange antennae are some morphological characters of adult male S. kiritshenkoi. Adult females of S. kiritshenkoi have a hairy pleural membrane, and calcipala on the tarsus of the hind leg. Scutum is black or dark grey-black with ornatum pattern. Antennae are orange-red []."
"A 25 year-old first-time pregnant woman was admitted to the maternity ward 6 days after the likely probable expected date of delivery with an intact amniotic membrane and no labor activity. Uterus didelphys anomaly was diagnosed using 2D ultrasound examination on an outpatient basis during a female consultation visit. After spontaneous conception, ultrasonography at 8 weeks of gestations was performed ().\nThe fetal estimated weight obtained by ultrasonography during patient pregnancy consultation at 37 weeks was 3143 g (between 50th–75th centile) []. The fetus was male. The amniotic fluid index (AFI) was above the 5th centile and the umbilical artery Doppler’s were normal. The obstetric examination after admission revealed a longitudinal vaginal septum, two 80% shortened uterine cervixes with 0.5 cm widening, and a Bishop score of 4 points (cervical position–posterior, cervical consistency–medium, cervical effacement—80%, cervical dilatation—0.5 cm, fetal station—3). The external pelvimetry showed normal pelvic dimensions. An ultrasound examination confirmed pregnancy in the left uterus. Fetal presentation was defined as occipital-iliac sinister anterior. Cardiotocography showed no deviations from the norm. Induction of oxytocin was performed for the duration of two days to induce labor activity. Due to the lack of effect and any change in obstetric status (Bishop score—4), the decision to proceed with a C-section was made. The genital uterine anomaly, i.e., uterus didelphys, was verified during surgery. A live-born male infant of 2730 g birth weight, 48 cm height, and Apgar score of 9–10 points was delivered. The patient postpartum time period was uncomplicated. On the follow-up visit between 4-6 weeks, the patient was in good health condition and without complains."
A 25-year-old male was seen at the neurosurgery department. Patient had a history of fibrous dysplasia affecting the frontal bone and cranium. He underwent multiple surgeries and reconstruction using titanium mesh. The result was deemed unsatisfactory. He was referred to our department for planning PEEK PSI for the cranium. A bicoronal approach was utilized for the surgery. Patient satisfaction was reported as excellent postoperatively (Fig. ).
"Clinical findings: A 25-year-old lady presented with chronic right side abdominal pain for 1 year, the pain was dull aching in nature, relieved by analgesics and associated with nausea and no vomiting. The patient has repeated attacks of the same pain with variable intensities.\nThe patient has negative medical and surgical histories, and she had no history of chronic drug usage. She had repeated visits to the hospital for the same pain.\nDuring examination she had normal vital signs, with no fever. The general examination was unremarkable. Abdominal examination showed tenderness on palpation in the right hypochondrial region.\nDiagnostic assessment: The complete blood picture showed mildly elevated white blood cell count (11.9 mm3), with normal hemoglobin and platelet count.\nAbdominal ultrasound showed normal liver and spleen. The common bile duct was normal, with suspicion of small contacted gall bladder. Other intra-abdominal and pelvic organs were normal. .\nMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed normal caliber common bile duct (4mm) in diameter, with normal both right and left hepatic duct, the gall bladder was not visualized. The pancreatic duct was normal in size (2mm). , .\nThe patient received oral analgesics with little response, and had repeated admissions due to similar pain.\nTherapeutic Intervention: Decision for diagnostic laparoscopy was done. During laparoscopy exploration of the whole peritoneal cavity was performed. The gall bladder was not visualized after complete visualization of biliary anatomy. The appendix was inflamed with multiple adhesions with the bowel. The cecum was high placed in the sub-hepatic region. Laparoscopic appendicectomy was performed. , .\nFollow-up and outcomes: The patient was admitted for 2 days after surgery with no postoperative complications. Follow up was done for 6 months after surgery with improvement of the general condition and no similar attacks of the pain."
"The patient was a 25-year-old male with severe facial asymmetry and mandibular prognathism. On clinical examination, the maxillary midline was deviated to the right side by 2 mm. The mandible was deviated to the right side by 7 mm. Three-millimeter canting of the maxilla was present, which the left side of the maxilla was longer than the right side. The surgical movement of maxillary surgery consisted 3 mm of canting correction, 2 mm of posterior impaction, and 2 mm of midline correction to the left side. For the mandible, asymmetric correction via IVSRO (right side, advance 1 mm; left side, setback 11.5 mm) was done. On the maxillary landmarks, the asymmetry indices were improved on U6 (from − 3.04 to − 2.00) and U1 (from − 3.52 to − 1.17). The asymmetry indices on mandibular landmarks were greatly improved on L1 (from − 14.00 to − 1.25), B point (from − 16.83 to − 2.83), and Me (from − 16.74 to − 2.03) (Fig. )."
"The first patient was a 25-year-old man with moderate myopia. On ophthalmic examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, and the intraocular pressure was within normal limits. The anterior segment examinations performed in both eyes were normal. There were paracentral scotomas in his left eye, and a glaucoma hemifield test (GHT) of the left eye was borderline compared with the GHT of the normal right eye (Fig. ). It was not easy to find the aberrant microvessel that crossed the foveal avascular zone using colour fundus photography (Fig. ); however, a fundus image on OCTA clearly revealed the vessel in the left eye (Fig. ). This aberrant vessel was a small perifoveolar arteriovenous communication. The central retinal artery divides into two branches at the optic disc: the superior artery and the inferior artery. After an extremely short ascending course following its origin, the superior artery separated into a macular branch that then horizontally reached the macula. The abnormal vessel traversed vertically over the entire macula and eventually converged with the branch of the inferior temporal vein. For the central or inner ring, the values for VD and PD obtained in the left eye surpassed those of the opposite eye (Fig. , Table ). Nevertheless, the measurements obtained for FAZ dimensions, including its area, perimeter and circularity, were markedly smaller in the left eye than in the contralateral eye (Table ). Macular oedema and exudation were not recorded (Fig. )."
"The second patient was a 25-year-old woman with no past ophthalmic history. Visual acuity was 20/20 without correction in both eyes. Intraocular pressure measurement, anterior segment examination and visual field were normal in both eyes. A fundus image was normal in the right eye, whereas in the left eye, it revealed the presence of an abnormal vessel (Fig. ). This aberrant microvessel was a communication of the superior temporal artery and the inferior temporal vein. The VD and PD values obtained in the left eye exceeded those obtained in the other eye (Fig. , Table ), whereas the measurements of FAZ dimensions were smaller in the left eye than in the right eye (Table ). No ocular complications occurred."
"The case was a 25-year-old MG3L1ab2 woman with a history of infertility, complaining from irregular uterine bleeding and she was diagnosed with a pelvic mass in MRI. She got married 7 years ago.\nAll of her pregnancies were by induction and ovulation and the first and second pregnancies were aborted spontaneously between 6 and 8 weeks. The third pregnancy, 3 years ago, was terminated by cesarean section and resulted in the birth of a healthy baby.\nThe patient who had menorrhagia for the last 6 months was examined for irregular uterine bleeding. She also complained about occasional pains under the abdomen and in the right upper quadrant abdomen. In MRI, the retroperitoneal uterus and endometrial thickness was 5 mm, and a mass with an abnormal heterogeneous signal and heterogenic enhancement of about 95×80 mm in the anterolateral and right border of the hip with the extension to the hypogastric region was reported suggesting tumoral lesions in the right ovary or endometrium ().\nAccording to the report of the ovarian mass in MRI, the patient became a candidate for laparoscopy.\nThe laparoscopic surgery was planned in the operating room of Mehr Hospital in Mashhad on January 10, 2018. Initially, to enter the abdominal cavity, there was no possibility of passing the veress needle through abdominal wall from the umbilicus and the Palmer’s point, so the decision was made to enter the abdominal cavity through open laparoscopy. After creating a 2 cm incision in the umbilicus, and touching with finger, a solid and abnormal texture in this place was observed. Therefore, the decision was made to continue the operation by laparotomy.\nThe abdomen was opened with a midline incision and a solid mass was in the midline of the abdominal wall adhering to the rectus muscles and the fascia with 12 cm in size. First, the mass was dissected from the rectus muscles and the peritoneum below it. After complete dissection, it was observed that the mass was connected to the abdominal wall with a relatively thick bundle (2 cm) in the suprapubic region ().\nThe mass was similar to uterine fibroids in shape and consistency. After complete removal of the mass, in the examination of the abdominal wall, the visceral peritoneum was completely healthy. The visceral peritoneum was opened to check the abdominal cavity. No specific pathological findings were observed in the examination of the abdomen and pelvis. The uterus and adnexa were completely healthy and there was no evidence of adhesion, mass or ovarian cyst or uterine fibroids. So, the surgery was terminated.\nPathology report of the abdominal wall mass was leiomyoma."
"A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department of Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan with a 3-day history of high fever, chills, dry cough, myalgias, and diarrhea. He reported a sudden onset of symptoms. The patient is a medical student with no prior medical history. He reported recent travel with his family to Islamabad and Karachi, regions with known novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission, but family members denied similar complaints. The patient’s childhood and adult immunization records showed that all immunizations were up to date.\nConsidering the emergence of COVID-19 and the patient’s travel history, he was admitted to the hospital. Droplet and contact precautions were initiated. The staff caring for the patient were provided appropriate personal protective equipment.\nIn the ward, the patient was continuously shivering, with a temperature of 39.5°C, pulse 140 per minute, blood pressure 95/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate 18 per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. Breath sounds were equal and clear in both lung fields. Chest radiographs showed no abnormalities.\nInitial laboratory tests were mostly unremarkable but showed mild elevation of liver function tests (). Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 by reverse transcriptase–Polymerase chain reaction, and both tests were negative. Therefore, we decided to steer the patient’s management toward other infectious diseases within our differential diagnosis.\nThe patient was treated with intravenous hydration, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and paracetamol. Initially, he experienced relapsing high fevers, productive cough, severe myalgias, and worsening diarrhea. On the third day of hospital admission, the patient developed a maculopapular rash on the face and trunk, which gradually spread to the extremities over 2 days. To evaluate the rash, measles and varicella antibody tests were also conducted.\nMicroscopy of thick and thin smears for malaria, serology and surface antigen markers for viral hepatitis, and bacterial blood and stool cultures were negative. Testing for dengue showed positive IgM titers (1.6 U/L) and borderline NS1 antigen (0.8 µg/mL) results. Further serologic investigation revealed elevated IgM (137 U/L) against measles virus and negative serology for varicella. The same treatment measures were continued. By day 7, the patient’s fever, rash, and diarrhea had subsided; intravenous access was removed; and he was discharged."
"A 25-year-old male patient with a positive medical history for minor thalassemia and Gilbert syndrome presented to the hospital with a chief complaint of right posterior shoulder pain associated with weakness of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle of gradual progression over the course of 1.5 years. The patient noted pain and difficulty with overhead activities; thus, interfering with his activities of daily living. The patient explained that his right shoulder pain is exacerbated upon abduction and external rotation. He denied any traumatic event sustained to the right shoulder.\nOn physical examination, there was unidirectional shoulder instability, and decreased range of motion associated with clinical evidence of weakness of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. The patient showed clinical evidence of muscle wasting or hypotrophy. Moreover, the patient had a positive O’Brien active compression test, 3+ anterior load shift, 2+ posterior load shift, and a positive relocation test. Moreover, the patient had a negative Hawkins’ test, Neer’s sign, empty can test, and inverted empty can test. Plain radiographs showed no bony abnormalities. Subsequently, an MRI was taken of the right shoulder revealing a posterior tear to the glenoid labrum and a spinoglenoid ganglion cyst (, ). Fluoroscopy with contrast was also done, also confirming the diagnosis (). Preoperative electroneuromyography was suggestive of a suprascapular nerve impairment.\nThe patient was scheduled for right shoulder arthroscopy. Under general anesthesia, the patient’s right upper extremity was scrubbed and draped in beach chair position. The entry in the shoulder was by scope posterior portal while the insertion was under vision of anterior portal. Arthroscopic inspection confirmed MRI findings of posterior labral tear of the glenoid. The posterior-inferior labral tear is addressed. The 9 to 6 o’clock area of the glenoid rim is debrided with a burr, lasso suture is used to bring the labrum into place. Then two anchors were used to fix the tissue ensuring adequate capsule tension which led to cyst shrinkage.\nAt six month follow-up in the clinic as an outpatient, the patient denied any existing pain located at his right shoulder area or any associated muscle weakness interfering with his activities of daily living. Upon examination, the patient had regained full range of motion of his right glenohumeral joint without any limitations. The patient showed no residue signs of muscle hypotrophy and has regained the muscle mass which was previously hypotrophied upon his initial presentation."
"A 25-year old man was referred to the emergency department after suffering a shotgun injury of the abdomen. Apart from a congenital pectus excavatum, the chest examination was unremarkable. There was an inlet wound in the epigastrium with no exit, and the abdomen was tender all over.\nAt exploratory laparotomy, hemopertonium was found due to a grade III liver laceration. The bleeding could not be controlled with sutures. so we decided for perihepatic packing. Two days later, CT of the abdomen showed thrombosis of the superior mesenteric and portal veins, and there was no evidence of IHPA at that time. The packs were removed.\nOn the tenth postoperative day, the patient complained of a sudden severe abdominal pain. He was pale. The blood pressure was 88/48 mm Hg and pulse rate 142 per minute. The abdomen was tender. CT was done after resuscitation, showed a 24 cm × 13 cm × 8.2 cm heterogeneous subcapsular hepatic hematoma and a 1-cm IHPA (). Superselective hepatic angiography showed an IHPA of the right hepatic artery. The entry and exit points of the aneurysm were successfully embolized with two microcoils (). The patient was discharged home a few days later. No complications were reported during one year of follow up."
"This is a case of 25-year-old woman of body mass index (BMI) of 36 with comorbidity (sleep apnea) and was indicated for SG after medical therapy had failed []. The patient was poor and can’t pay for staplers used in laparoscopic SG, so we proceeded with open SG by midline incision ~10 cm above the umbilicus, and after cutting omentum and mobilization of the stomach, we applied non-crushing forceps and cut the stomach among the lesser curvature without applying bougie by estimation and then sutured the stomach remnant by double layers of vicryl leaving nasogastric tube (NGT) and drain and closed the abdomen and skin intradermally. At night, NGT was removed and the following morning she started to drink clear fluids. Drain was removed on the second day.\nShe was followed up for 6 months to monitor weight loss during the first month, she did well and complained slightly of vomiting after heavy meals, and after 3 months, she lost ~30% of total body weight."
"A 25-year-old pregnant woman was referred at 31 weeks of gestation. She had no significant medical history. Detailed fetal echocardiography showed cardiomegaly with dilation and poor contraction of the LV. The AOV was immobile with no forward flow in the left outflow tract (Fig. a), and blood filled the aorta by reverse flow from the ductus arteriosus. The aortic annulus diameter was 3.8 mm. We also observed left-to-right flow across the FOV, a monophasic mitral inflow pattern, mild mitral regurgitation (MR), and a left-sided aortic arch. The fetus also had mild ascites and pleural effusion, suggesting hydrops and heart failure secondary to severe critical AS. No extracardiac anomalies were observed.\nThe fetal orientation was favorable for intervention from the start such that a direct approach as described above was smoothly performed from the apex and was successful on the first attempt. Serial follow-up fetal echocardiography assessments showed improvement of left ventricular function, improvement of aortic flow, disappearance of MR, and reversal of the shunt across the FOV. The fetus was delivered by normal vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 2.7 kg. Postnatal echocardiography showed unicuspid thickening and a stenotic AOV with a mean pressure of 58 mmHg and no AR. The neonatal Ross procedure was performed after postnatal balloon dilatation had resulted in residual severe AV stenosis and moderate AR. At the time of this writing, the child was 7 years old and doing well."
"Case 6 was a 25-year-old Caucasian male with the full mutation. His developmental milestones were delayed with sitting at 7 months, crawling at 8 months, walking at 1 year, but at 2 years he was only saying single words and he did not speak in sentences until about 4 years of age. His behavior included hand flapping, poor eye contact, tactile defensiveness, hyperactivity, perseveration, tantrum behavior about three to four times a week, mainly with verbal outbursts, yelling and irritability at least once a day. His full scale IQ of 61 fell in a mildly delayed range. On the ADOS Module 4 he met ASD criteria. On the ADIS, he met criteria for social phobia, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety. He also showed some psychotic features with hearing voices, and laughs to himself frequently."
"A 25-year-old woman asked for a breast augmentation (A,B). She was randomly assigned to Group B. Bilateral breast augmentation was performed by round high-profile silicone implants (235 mL) and SEL of 56 mL on the right breast and 65 mL on the left breast. Photos were taken postoperatively 12 months after the procedure (C,D). At 12 months, her satisfaction was rated very good."
"A 25-year-old man, without previous medical history, was presented to our eye clinic with decreased visual acuity in the left eye for 3 months. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.3 in the left eye and 1.0 in the right eye, with normal intraocular pressures. A massive intraretinal lipid accumulation with overlying vascular telangiectasis and hemorrhages was observed in the left eye (Figs. and a). Fluorescein angiogram (FFA) (Retinal Camera, TRC-50DX, Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) revealed early hyperfluorescence of telangiectatic bulbs in the temporal regions, and hypofluorescence consistent with the subretinal exudates in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) (CirrusHD-OCT 5000, Cail Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Clifornia USA) showed macular edema in his left eye with a foveal thickness of 802 μm. A diagnosis of adult-onset Coats’ disease was made. Examination of his right eye was unremarkable. Intraocular injection of an anti-VEGF drug (Conbercept) was performed. Before injection, the aqueous humor was removed and the levels of VEGF and inflammatory cytokines were measured. The result showed a normal VEGF level and increased Interleukin (IL) -8 (Table ). At 1 week after the first injection, the macular edema was alleviated (Fig. b), with an increased BCVA of 0.5. However, after 1 month, BCVA decreased again with recurrent macular edema (Fig. c). A second injection of anti-VEGF was administrated and again the aqueous humor was acquired before injection. The level of VEGF was low and the level of IL-8 and VACM in the aqueous humor had increased (Table ). Macular edema remained at this time, and laser coagulation was given at 3 weeks after injection. At 1 month after the second injection, BCVA dropped to 0.3. In consideration of the aqueous humor cytokine concentrations, treatment switched to intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex®) (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, Calif., USA). Then the macular edema decreased dramatically (Fig. d) and BCVA increased to 0.6 at 2 weeks after injection. No further recurrence of macular edema was noted during 12 weeks of follow-up. Intraocular pressure was elevated at 10 weeks after injection (29 mmHg). After cartiolol hydrochloride eye drops were administrated 2 times a day, the IOP reduced to a normal level. No other adverse effect of the steroid was observed during the course of treatment and follow-up."
"A 25-year-old married Chinese woman was admitted to our department. She was diagnosed with LSIL based on cytology findings 2 month ago. Her cervical cytosmear was positive for HPV16 and 58, tested by flow-through hybridization method. Cyto-immunohistochemical staining revealed p16 and Ki-67 positive cells, the percentage of the latter was greater than 25%. She was otherwise healthy except a 4-year history of eczema and 1-year history of leukoplakia vulvae. Three months after completion of treatment, her HPV (Scraping) test was negative and the cytology examination was normal."
"Patient II.2, a 25-year-old male, had uncomplicated chickenpox at 2 years of age (he had not received the varicella vaccine) and did not report any significant infections apart from a knee wound infection following a scooter accident at 16 years of age and warts at 25 years of age. He was working as an operator of heavy machinery. Patient II.3, a 28-year-old male, had few upper respiratory tract infections in early childhood, severe chickenpox at 5 years of age, shingles at 6.5 years of age, and pneumonia at 10 years of age. He was reported to have difficulties with fine motor skills and co-ordination as a teenager. Both patients II.2 and II.3 had not suffered from autoimmunity or malignancy and their physical examination, including a detailed neurological assessment, was normal. The patients' parents and the three remaining siblings had not suffered from recurrent infections, autoimmunity, or malignancies, although the father (I.1) was investigated for an inflammatory lung nodule."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a long history of blurred vision. The patient had no known diseases or trauma history and his best corrected visual acuity was 20/32 with -0.50 D, -0.75 D x 180° in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in the right eye and 13 mmHg in the left eye, and anterior segment examination was normal. Fundus examination revealed that both optic discs were hypoplastic and tilted with accompanying gliotic tissue and prepapillary vascular loop; the vessels emerged perpendicularly, dilated, and straight from the optic disc and initially extended nasally before turning toward the temporal direction (). Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed hypoplastic, tilted optic discs and small foveal avascular zone (). Similar results were observed in fundus autofluorescence images (). Optic coherence tomography (OCT) revealed absent foveal pit and continuity of the inner retinal layers through the fovea in both eyes (). Central foveal thickness was 313 µm in the right and 312 µm in the left eye. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measured with OCT was 39 µm in both eyes. OCT angiography (OCTA) demonstrated absence of the foveal avascular zone in both the superficial and deep capillary plexuses in both eyes (). Axial length measured with A-mode ultrasound was 24.71 mm in the right and 24.72 mm in the left eye. The patient was diagnosed with fovea plana accompanied by multiple optic disc anomalies. The results of cranial magnetic resonance angiography to diagnose potential concomitant intracranial vascular pathologies were normal."
"A 25-year-old black female who underwent a bilateral breast reduction at another provider four weeks prior to arriving at the clinic presented with a chief concern of a foul odor coming from the areolas (Figure ). The patient had a body mass index (BMI) of 29.5, was originally an E cup, and had a reduction of over 1 kg per side per the previous provider. She had no other past medical history, no other surgeries, reported no allergies, no current medications, and no other substances such as ethanol, smoking, or recreational drugs. Physical exam was significant only for eschar completely overlying both areolas (Figure ). A diagnosis of bilateral NAC necrosis was made, and the subsequent treatment plan followed.\nTreatment began over the course of three months in the outpatient with partial debridement of eschar every two to three days. Further debridement was performed, excising fat necrosis extending to the muscle. This took place over the course of three weeks with patient education on wet to dry dressing application and change. At 21 days from the first encounter, debridement was combined with the breasts being packed with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (PhaseOne, Integrated Healing Technologies, Franklin, TN) and wrapped. Wet to dry dressings were changed at follow-up appointments every two to three days by the staff and at home daily by home health care. During these appointments, healthy granulation tissue was noted (Figure ). The patient was instructed to shower daily with antibacterial soap and cover wounds with dry gauze. Pictures were taken at 157 days post-procedure showing healed areolas (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old healthy man presented with blurred vision in his left eye (VA, 20/20) for 15 days (patient 2 in Tables and ). The right eye had 20/40 VA due to amblyopia. He reported previous treatments for OT. Anterior biomicroscopy of the left eye showed 1+ anterior chamber cells. A fundus examination showed mild vitritis, a focal exudative retinal choroidal lesion inferior to the pigmented retinal choroidal scars (Fig. a). A SS-OCT image through the active lesion showed that the inner retinal layers were abnormally hyperreflective with full-thickness disorganization of the retinal reflective layers. The choroid appeared thickened next to the active lesion (Fig. b). The color-coded decorrelation signal that overlaid the OCTA B-scan performed next to the lesion site showed no OCTA decorrelation signal and retinal neovascularization (Fig. c–e), which were confirmed by fluorescein angiography (FA). The clinical suspicion of toxoplasmosis was confirmed by high positive IgG levels (461.7 IU/ml; reference value, < 30 IU/ml). The IgM titer was negative (< 0.8 IU/ml). The patient was treated with an oral combination of 160 mg of trimethoprim and 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole, 1 tablet bid for 6 weeks, which resulted in lesion regression (Fig. f) and resolution of the visual symptoms. OCTA performed next to the lesion site showed persistent absence of decorrelation signal around the unchanged retinal neovascularization (Fig. h–j). The patient underwent sectorial retinal photocoagulation during this same visit."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian female with a history of major depression with psychotic features presented with new-onset generalized weakness, dark urine, and jaundice. The patient noted on admission that she was on day 5 out of seven days of amoxicillin-clavulanate for the treatment of a sinus infection, the symptoms of which had completely resolved. On admission, vital signs were unremarkable. Physical exam was significant for jaundice with scleral icterus, but no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly was present.\nLaboratory testing revealed anemia with low hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) level (patient's baseline Hb 14). Liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were both elevated, and haptoglobin was low suggesting a hemolytic anemia (Table ). A peripheral blood smear (PBS) was completed which revealed spherocytes and degmacytes placing a hemolytic anemia higher on the differential.\nThe patient reported no personal or family history of anemia or liver disease. She reported consumption of approximately two beers per week and denied use of recreational drugs. She denied any allergies. The patient's home medications included quetiapine, hydroxyzine, and escitalopram. She had been on all of her home medications for over one year with no reported side effects. Due to reported liver dysfunction with quetiapine, this medication was initially held pending further workup.\nUltrasound of the liver was completed and revealed no abnormalities. Antinuclear antibody, hepatitis panel, and urine hemosiderin were negative. Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) revealed negative IgG and positive anti-C3. Cold agglutinin titer and the Donath-Landsteiner test were negative. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with DIIHA secondary to amoxicillin. The patient's Hb continued to trend down, ranging from 5.7 to 7.5 g/dL. She required several transfusions of packed red blood cells (RBCs) to keep an Hb goal of more than 7 g/dL. Due to continued anemia, she was started on a two-week course of prednisone. After four to five days of treatment, her anemia and LFTs improved. She was restarted on quetiapine with no worsening of symptoms. Laboratory tests one week after discharge revealed near normal Hb and LFTs."
"During a follow up CT scan, 6 years after a right orchidectomy and multiple courses of systemic therapy for a testis tumor, a retroperitoneal mass was found in a male patient in his twenties. The primary testis tumor was a type II TGCT, consisting of combined teratoma and seminoma of 1.4 cm comprising a stage IIIc intermediate risk non-seminoma of the testis. At that time, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (beta-HCG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were elevated. The patient was treated with 4 cycles of chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) and reached complete remission. Although the finding of a retroperitoneal mass was not accompanied by raised AFP, beta-HCG and LDH, it was considered highly suspicious for recurrent GCT and a retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy was performed. Pathological examination revealed a radically resected teratoma composed of cystically enlarged mature epithelial glands, mature pancreas parenchyma and an acinar cell carcinoma (ACC). There were no radiological abnormalities in the pancreas itself, neither prior to surgery, nor 3 months after the lymphadenectomy. This therefore suggested the development of an ACC in the metastatic teratomatous type II TGCT without a primary tumor in the pancreas."
"In November 2014, a 25-year-old female in the third trimester of pregnancy presented to Makeni General Hospital in Bombali district with abdominal pain consistent with labour. She had no other symptoms, was afebrile, had normal conjunctivae, and appeared well. At the time of admission, systematic EVD screening was not in place at the facility and she was not questioned about potential EVD exposures. Two hours after admission, the neonate was delivered by uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. The neonate appeared healthy and was feeding well. The nurse who performed the delivery wore routine obstetrical personal protective equipment (PPE) including a disposable gown and gloves.\nUnexpectedly, 12 hours later, the patient developed profuse vaginal bleeding and required a blood transfusion. Despite administration of ergometrine and oxytocin, the vaginal bleeding persisted and she began bleeding at the site of the peripheral intravenous cannula. Although she remained afebrile, the bleeding alerted medical staff to the possibility of EVD. She was moved to an EVD isolation ward attached to the hospital pending transfer to a facility for patients suspected of EVD. However, she continued to bleed and died of post-partum haemorrhage several hours later. As per standard practice for all deaths during this time, post-mortem reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was performed on an oral swab and found to be positive for EBOV. The neonate was never tested for EBOV and was discharged home to the care of family members in the father's village, as there was no suspicion of EVD. The products of conception (amniotic fluid, placenta) were not tested for EBOV.\nSubsequent epidemiologic investigation uncovered that the patient was from a quarantined village and had been identified as a possible contact of a known case of EVD within the 21 days prior to admission. When labour began, she broke her quarantine, travelled to the hospital, and used her husband's address from a different village because of fear that she would otherwise be denied health care.\nNone of the healthcare staff involved in the delivery developed EVD. However, contact investigations revealed that another pregnant woman who delivered a neonate at the same time and in the same delivery room, and was cared for by the same health-care providers, died of EVD twelve days post-partum and was likely infected through nosocomial transmission.\nThe baby became ill and died soon after discharge. Direct child-care and a traditional burial of the baby triggered an outbreak of an unknown number of additional EVD cases in the case patient's husband's village."
"A 25-year-old patient, gravida 2 para 1, was admitted to the emergency department at seven weeks plus two days of amenorrhea accompanied with the complaints of vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. She did not carry any of the risks for EP and was not using any method for contraception. Physical examination revealed that her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute. It also reported postural hypotension. There was also the presence of abdominal guarding and rebound tenderness. Vaginal examination revealed slight-moderate bleeding; however, she felt pain mainly on the right side during the bimanual examination. Trans-vaginal ultrasound revealed left ovarian anechoic cyst of 30 mm and four embryos in the right tube (). All the embryos had cardiac activities and crown rump length measurements were consistent with average seven weeks of pregnancy. There was free fluid and coagulum in the pouch of Douglas and the right para-ovarian space. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were 9.8 gr/dL and 29%, respectively. Clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with the tubal rupture. More importantly, the presence of hemodynamic instability led us to perform an emergency laparotomy. Informed consent was obtained from the patient. Under general anesthesia, the abdominal cavity was accessed via Pfannenstiel incision. Further exploration revealed that tubal pregnancy on the right side had ruptured, which ultimately led to hemo-peritoneum with approximately 800 mL of blood and coagulum. The left tube and the cornual portions of the uterus were intact. Right salpingectomy was performed, and all the materials were sent to pathology. The final pathology report revealed tubal quadruplet pregnancy and chronic salpingitis. A detailed gross examination of the right tube revealed that its diameter was 40 mm in its widest part and four embryos were identified between the pieces of coagulum ()."
"A 25-year-old G2P1 woman with a history of hernia repair presented with a slowly enlarging left labial mass, first noticed approximately eight years ago when she felt intermittent sharp and burning pain in the region aggravated by wearing tight pants. The mass was visible on the physical exam and measured up to 5 cm in size. Sporadic exacerbation of pain was frequently noted without exacerbating factors; however, it was also occasionally noted when wearing tight pants. Follow-up pelvic MRI showed a circumscribed, lipomatous mass in the subcutaneous soft tissues of the left labia measuring 4.9 cm x 2.1 cm x 1.6 cm (Figure ). The mass appears mildly T1 hypointense to the adjacent subcutaneous fat and hyperintense to the surrounding muscles; there is Indian-ink chemical shift artifacts on the opposed-phase gradient recalled echo (GRE) images, confirming macroscopic fat within the lesion; there is also heterogeneous T1 enhancement on the post-contrast, fat-saturated T1 sequence; a prominent vessel courses through the central portion of the mass.\nThe vulvar mass was surgically excised and sent for histopathologic analysis. The gross surgical specimen was well circumscribed with a tan and homogenous cut surface. On histological examination, the tissue showed clusters of microvacuolated brown fat cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm (hibernoma cells) without malignant features, which are characteristic of typical hibernoma (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old male patient with no significant past medical history presented with a three-day history of a tender mass in the right axilla along with fevers. The patient did not report any night sweats and weight loss. The mass showed no signs of drainage or infection. His physical examination revealed a 3 x 5 cm mobile, soft and non-nodular mass in the right axilla. An ultrasound of the right axilla showed a fluid-filled mass, which was concerning for an abscess. A needle aspiration was attempted without success; therefore, a referral to breast imaging clinic for a diagnostic ultrasound of the mass was initiated. Targeted ultrasound showed axillary lymphadenopathy at the site of the clinically palpable mass (Figure ). Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed, and pathology revealed suppurative granulomatous lymphadenitis suggestive of CSD. Serology was not available for this case."
"A 25-year-old Hispanic male with no known past medical history presented to the hospital complaining of left upper abdominal quadrant pain. He stated that pain started after he returned from a trip to a location at 16,700 feet of altitude. In the hospital, his vital signs were within normal limits except for tachycardia. On the physical exam, there was splenomegaly with tenderness to palpation. The ultrasound showed heterogeneous images in the spleen compatible with ischemic lesions, which were confirmed later as splenic infarcts with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen (Figure ). His lab results were as follows: hemoglobin of 15 g/dL, hematocrit of 49%, leukocytes of 6.28 x 109/L, and platelets of 453 x 109/L. Trying to find the cause, we ordered protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, factor V Leiden, and D-dimer tests, which came back negative. After that, we conducted hemoglobin electrophoresis, showing hemoglobin A (HbA) of 57.5%, HbS of 39%, hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) of 3.5%, and hemoglobin F (HbF) 1.9%. The patient was diagnosed with SCT, which was treated with hydration and pain management until symptoms resolved."
"The patient is a 25-year-old male who was referred from cardiology with a diagnosis of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), altered consciousness and acute renal impairment. From the onset of symptoms, time to angiography was two hours. Angiography demonstrated a left anterior descending artery (LAD) filling defect (Figure ), and an echocardiogram performed showed a mobile left atrial mass (Figure ) attached to the interatrial septum.\nECG showed ST elevation in the anterior chest leads with a positive troponin. Due to the multisystem nature of presentation, along with evidence of a mobile mass in the left atrium, it was suspected that the mass was the primary lesion responsible for showering small pieces throughout the vascular tree. The patient was taken to the operating room with plans to remove the mass from the left atrium and place a graft to the LAD to overcome acute ischemia and avoid MI. Using aortocaval cannulation and cardioplegic arrest on aortic cross clamp and moderate hypothermia, the left mammary artery (LIMA) was harvested. The left atrium was opened and a large 3 cm x 3.5 cm myxoma was excised and the left ventricle irrigated with normal saline to remove any missed detached particle. The LIMA was anastomosed to the LAD and routine rewarming and deairing of aortic root was completed. The heart began to beat spontaneously after removing the cross clamp. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) after surgery for 48 hours. Consciousness and renal function began recovering gradually. The mass was sent for histopathologic examination and returned with the diagnosis of myxoma. The patient spent another seven days in the ward and was discharged home in good health."
"A 25-year old female was referred for the evaluation of new scotomas in the left eye without a viral prodrome. On initial evaluation, funduscopic examination revealed several pigmented areas of RPE scarring in the right eye and 8–10 cream-colored lesions in the posterior pole of the left eye (). ICG confirmed intense hypocyanescent lesions that were visualized to a greater degree than could be appreciated clinically in the left eye. She underwent a negative infectious work-up and was started on prednisone 100 mg daily. Coxsackievirus titers at this initial visit revealed an elevated CVB2 titer (1:40) and an elevated CVB3 titer (1:160).\nAt the one-month follow-up visit, funduscopic examination showed complete resolution of cream-colored lesions in the left eye. Approximately one year later, the patient presented with a new scotoma in the left eye, and funduscopic examination revealed new cream-colored deep lesions near the fovea in the left eye (). ICG showed multiple hypocyanescent lesions corresponding to the cream-colored lesions visualized on exam. High-dose prednisone (100 mg daily) was then initiated. CVB titers showed an increased coxsackievirus B3 titer (1:320) compared to the initial visit.\nOne month after disease recurrence, the patient’s examination revealed stable scarring in the right eye and increased hyperpigmentation overlying the previously active lesions in the left eye. Upon further discussion, the patient deferred starting immunosuppression and she was continued on a prednisone taper."
"First Incidence\nA 25-year-old Southeast Asian male presented with a history of vision loss in 2007. At that time, he was given the diagnosis of retinal hemangioblastoma (RHB). Later, he had multiple retinal surgeries, which improved his vision. At the same time, his sequencing of the VHL gene came back positive. However, he did not follow up on it after the surgery.\nSecond Incidence\nIn 2013, he suffered left eye vision loss. A perimetry test showed scotomas on perimetry with an enlarged blind spot (Figure ).\nWithin a year after this presentation, he complained of headaches with intermittent dizziness and incoordination. On clinical examination, he was found to have right upper and lower limb numbness with gait ataxia. On further investigation, the MRI brain was suggestive of a cystic lesion with midline posterior fossa tumor, compressing anterior and posterior surface medulla oblongata with resultant hydrocephalus. Later on, he was operated for posterior fossa tumor with cervical-1 arch tumor excision, which was sent for excision biopsy and came back with results suggestive of hemangioblastoma. He then developed pain in his abdomen during the same admission; his ultrasound abdomen was done, which showed chronic pancreatitis with distal calculus (Figure ). He responded to symptomatic therapy with hydration. After that, he remained healthy for six years until the present admission.\nThird Incidence\nIn March 2020, at the age of 38, the patient presented with complaints of neck pain and difficulty walking for the past one month. Considering his symptoms and past medical history, we performed a cervical spine MRI, which showed a heterogeneous cystic lesion in the cervical cord starting from lower medulla till upper dorsal spine, suggestive of hemangioblastoma (Figures , ). A formal diagnosis of VHL syndrome was made. A summary of the case is shown in Table ."
"A 25-year old healthy Spanish female attended to the University Dental Clinic of European University of Valencia with recurrent abscesses at the upper right lateral incisor region for the last two years. The patient did not report any previous traumatism and clinically, no caries was observed. Nevertheless, adhesive restorations were found on the palatal side of the teeth 1.2 and 1.3. These teeth were not mobile but were sensitive to percussion and palpation, especially tooth 1.2. Furthermore, thermal and electrical pulp vitality tests were negative. Periodontal probing was performed after local anesthesia, and no periodontal pockets were found.\nPeriapical radiographs were taken from different projection angles. A large radiolucent area (>1cm) was observed around the apex of the endodontically treated teeth 1.2 and 1.3 (Fig. ).\nAfter conducting the conventional clinical and radiological assessment, a CBCT scan (Kodac CS 9000 Carestream ®) was performed to establish a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. CBCT images revealed, in the middle third of tooth 1.2, the presence of a non-endodontically treated accessory root (Fig. ). Furthermore, the axial and coronal planes showed a radiopaque image in this accessory root, probably derived from the sealer cement of the main root canal (Fig. ). In addition, the 3D reconstruction showed the existence of a second apex, belonging to the accessory root (Fig. ).\nBased on clinical and radiological findings, an endo-periodontal lesion associated to a palatogingival groove (type III according to Gu Y-Ch (5)) found in the upper right lateral incisor was considered the definitive diagnosis. The treatment plan of this primary periodontal lesion with secondary endodontic involvement was as follows: periapical surgery combined with root amputation and sealing with MTA, and guided bone regeneration for reconstruction of bone defect."
"A 25 year old man presented to the ED with irritability, painful extremities, severe abdominal pain, blurred vision and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure after he discontinued his NTBC treatment 1 month prior to this. On admission he was hypertensive and tachycardic. He was treated with supportive measures, heme arginate infusion and NTBC and symptoms resolved."
"A 25 y/o female complained from a pulsatile mass over her right frontal area. She had no history of trauma. Physical examinations revealed a large pulsatile mass-like lesion measuring about 5x5x2 cm with at least 2 feeder arteries on the scalp and one feeder artery from the right superficial temporal artery. The involved scalp was tender. There was no evidence of any facial nerve compromise or any other neurologic deficits. Brain and neck CT angiography was performed to rule out any intracranial or extracranial vascular lesions.\nSpiral CT-angiography of cervical region demonstrated multiple dilated tortuous vessels in subcutaneous fat of right side of the scalp in the right frontal and supplied by branching from right external carotid artery suggestive of scalp arteriovenous malformation in the right frontal area. There were no signs of any intracranial involvement or bone erosion ( and ). Also, spiral CT angiography of the brain was normal with no sign of AVM.\nDue to the proximity of one feeder artery to the right orbit, we decided to choose a surgical approach instead of the endovascular approach to prevent any ophthalmic complications. A written consent was provided from the patient. First, via two facial incisions, superficial temporal artery was ligated and then, circumferential sutures were applied on the scalp for transient bleeding control, and all feeding arteries were ligated and AVM was resected completely (). Finally, hemostatic sutures were removed and the patient had an uneventful post-op course."
"A 25-year-old man with no past medical or drug history, presented to the emergency room with an acute pain of the right upper quadrant and flank evolving for three days associated with fever. The patient reported no chronic abdominal pain or transit disorders.\nPhysical examination showed that the patient had fever 39 °c. The abdominal examination revealed the presence of a 10 cm - regularly shaped, soft, and fixed mass in the right hypochondria and flank. The rest of the abdomen revealed no remarkable abnormalities.\nLaboratory tests showed a high c-reactive protein level (173.5mg/l) but a normal white blood cell count (7553/μl). No anemia nor hemostasis disorders were noticed. Furthermore, urine culture was normal.\nFirstly, we decided to perform an abdominal ultrasound that showed a cystic formation of the right pericolic gutter with a thick wall and several septa within. The mass had close relationships with the sixth liver segment and the ascending colon. At first, we suspected a hydatid cyst of the liver because Tunisia is an hydatid endemic area. However, a malignant tumor of the colon could not be ruled out.\nTherefore, we indicated an abdominal CT scan to characterize the mass and determine its exact location. It revealed a regular 10-cm- intraperitoneal cystic mass independent from the liver but repressing the ascending colon with heterogonous internal density. Moreover, the mass was multilocular edged by thick walls showing low contrast enhancement after intravenous injection. Peritoneal effusion was detected on CT scan in the pericolic gutter and douglas pouch, to boot (, ).\nAn infected cystic lymphangioma was then suspected besides the diagnosis of intraperitoneal hydatid disease or infected malignant tumor of the colon. We decided then to perform open surgery for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose.\nWe found a 10-cm-cystic-mass containing a serous bloody fluid in the right pericolic gutter depending from the ascending colon. The colon was not distended. No liver metastasis nor peritoneal carcinosis were noticed. An ileocolic en bloc -resection was performed with an immediate ileocolic anastomosis. ().\nMacroscopically, the 10 –cm colonic cystic mass had many septas and contained serous fluid. It was obviously arising from the ascending colon. In addition, histopathological examination revealed dilated lymphatic and vascular components lined with attenuated endothelial cells. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of a cystic lymphangioma. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful. He was discharged on the 5th post-operative day. A 6-months clinical and radiological follow-up showed no symptoms or recurrence with good tolerance to regular diet."
"A 25-years-old male presented to Jahra Hospital, Kuwait, with confusion after the ingestion of methanol. In the emergency room, he had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH 6.8, HCO3 8 mmol/L, anion gap 31 mmol/L), elevated serum lactate (16.6 mmol/L), and hypoglycemia. Treatment was started with intravenous dextrose, thiamine, and sodium bicarbonate infusion. Due to persistent acidosis, dialysis was started through a right femoral catheter. After dialysis, his metabolic parameters improved, and the catheter was removed. His medication included enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for DVT prophylaxis, omeprazole, folic acid, and thiamine. On the 5th day of hospital stay, the patient's platelet count decreased (), with normal white blood cells, hemoglobin, and coagulation profile, so his enoxaparin prophylaxis was substituted with fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily. On the 6th day of hospital stay, he started to develop right-sided thigh pain and swelling. Urgent ultrasound examination of the deep venous system revealed right external iliac, femoral, and popliteal vein recent thrombosis. Fondaparinux was increased to a therapeutic dose according to his body weight (7.5 mg once daily) and HIT serology was sent. Over the next days, the patient's condition was improving, and blood examination showed recovery of platelet count (). Heparin-induced anti-platelet antibodies were detected at 0.846 optical density (OD) units, and the confirmatory functional assay was positive. Given his clinical and laboratory improvement, we decided to start him on rivaroxaban. Loading dose 15 mg twice daily for 21 days was started and the patient was released to outpatient care. Follow-up in outpatient revealed continued clinical improvement. The treatment was well tolerated with no adverse effects and the dosing was switched to 20 mg once daily to complete a total of three months of treatment. Three months after the hospital discharge, the patient underwent outpatient examination that revealed a good overall condition with a normal platelet count and recanalization of the deep venous system on ultrasound examination. Rivaroxaban was stopped and the patient was instructed to avoid heparin for life."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred to our outpatient clinic with complaints of chronic headache and irregular menses. Hormone profile showed only moderate increase in Prolactin (96 ng/ml). Sellar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a pituitary mass. The patient had total pituitary adenectomy using an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. After tumor resection, diaphragmatic opening was seen with intra-operative evidence of CSF leak. Sellar floor reconstruction was performed by mucosal graft and Glubran®2 glue filling the surgical cavity. Early post-operative period was uneventful and clinical and histopathologic finding were consistent with a non-functional pituitary adenoma.\nAfter 2 months of surgery, the patient complained of headache, facial pain and greenish foul-smelling nasal discharge with solid particles. Patient was diagnosed with rhinosinusitis and treated with multiple courses of nasal decongestants and antibiotics for 4 months but without improvement. Brain MRI showed inflammation and thickening of the sphenoidal and para-sphenoidal mucosa (Fig. a and b).\nSurgery with endoscopic endonasal approach was decided. Intra-operatively, the sellar floor was seen intact with no CSF leak nor discharge. A solid glass-like patches (acrylic glue) was seen in the inferior and lateral areas of the sphenoid sinus and was surrounded with inflamed infected mucosa and abundant pussy discharge (Fig. c and d). Efforts were made to erupt and de-crust the solid mass until total resection was achieved. Early post-operative period was uneventful, and a course of antibiotics was continued until total regression of the discharge. Endoscopic follow-up was performed in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd post-operative months, and showed no signs of rhinosinusitis with well-healed nasal mucosa."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of weakness and numbness in both his legs. At his first visit, neurological examination revealed normal muscle strength with a muscle stretch reflex indicating hyperreflexia in the lower limbs. In addition, pain radiating to the back was induced by back flexion or extension and jumping. He was ambulatory, although a spastic gait was evident.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intradural extramedullary lesion with hypointense changes on T1 and isointense changes on T2 as well as heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement at the T10 and T11 levels (). Although MRI findings appeared circumscribed, the mass was large and was located on the ventrolateral side. An accurate preoperative diagnosis was considered important; thus, we performed myelography to obtain more detailed information. Injection of iohexol was performed following puncture at the L4 and L5 levels, and 1 ml of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected for a CSF analysis. He reported back and lower limb pain after the injection of 2 ml of iohexol. As he reported severe pain just after the injection of 5 ml of iohexol, 3 ml of CSF was drained, and the pain improved immediately. Computed tomography (CT) after myelography revealed a rostrally migrated intradural mass with an approximately 10 mm discrepancy in the exact location compared to MRI findings (). After myelography, weakness and decreased sensation in the lower limbs gradually developed, resulting in paraplegia with a muscle strength of grade 0/5. A second lumbar puncture was performed, and 10 ml of CSF was drained. After CSF drainage, the symptoms—including weakness and sensory disturbance—immediately improved.\nSurgical treatment the day after myelography achieved complete resection of the intradural extramedullary tumor, and a histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma (). At 12 months after surgery (), he was working as a physical education teacher despite having hyperreflexia in his lower limbs."
"A 25-year-old female, para two and gravida two, with no known comorbidities, and history of cesarean section 10 days back, presented to the emergency department with a right-sided upper and lower limb weakness and sensory loss for one day. According to the patient, she was in her usual state of health when she suddenly developed right-sided weakness and sensory loss that was not associated with fits, fever, or headache. There was no family history of early-onset stroke.\nOn examination, she was of average height and build, well oriented, and lying comfortably in the bed. Her temperature was 98.6oF, blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse was 90 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. On systemic examination her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15/15; however, the power of the right upper and lower limb was 0/5 and upgoing right plantar. She also had a loss of all sensations in the right upper and lower limb. Other systems were unremarkable on examination.\nLaboratory tests revealed the following: hemoglobin 13 g/dL, white cell count 8.0 x 109 cells/L, and platelets 188 x 109 cells/L. Random blood sugar (RBS), lipid profile, liver function test (LFT), urea, creatinine, and electrolytes were normal. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) were non-reactive. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin B12, and hypercoagulability workup were within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiography was unremarkable with good systolic function and no evidence of thrombus, patent foramen ovale, or atrial septal defect was found (Figure ).\nCT scan of the head was normal (Figure ).\nMRI scan of the head was done that showed a large area of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted 1 (DW1) image in the left parietal region with corresponding low signals on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (Figure , ). Susceptibility-weighted 1 (SW1) image showed a small area of blooming in the left parietal region suggesting hemorrhage (Figure ). This area appeared low on T1 and high on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2 images (Figure -). These findings were suggestive of acute ischemic infarction.\nThe patient was started on aspirin 300 mg once daily, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, and simvastatin 40 mg once daily. Her power in the right upper and lower limb gradually improved to 3/5. She was discharged after improvement in her symptoms and was asked to follow up in the outpatient department."
"A 25-year-old non-smoking male with a history of chest wall myoepithelial carcinoma status post excision, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy with relapse in and progression of disease on pembrolizumab presents to the emergency department (ED) with 10 days of progressive dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, and 45-pound weight loss over the past three months.\nInitial evaluation consisted of a chest x-ray and CT of the chest with contrast, which revealed metastatic spread to the patient’s lungs including spread to the epicardium, and a new pericardial effusion (Figures , ).\nDiagnostic transthoracic echocardiogram was then performed, which showed a very large circumferential pericardial effusion, measuring up to 4 cm along the right ventricular free wall, with associated findings concerning for tamponade physiology (Figure ).\nUrgent fluoroscopic-guided pericardiocentesis was then performed, removing 590 mL of serosanguinous fluid. A pigtail catheter drain was left in place for residual effusion, and subsequent serial echocardiography was performed, revealing a persistent small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion with continued respirophasic septal shifting, and annulus reversus on tissue Doppler imaging suggestive for ECP as the underlying cause for this clinical presentation (Figures -).\nFollowing the discovery of his ECP and the terminal nature of his malignancy, the patient wished to defer further procedures and definitive management for the ECP and was discharged to home hospice."
"A 25 years old man presented to us with a right ACL injury. He had an alleged injury in 2015 during a football game, where his right knee was twisted with the foot planted on the field. He suffered immediate swelling over the right knee and was unable to resume the game. Upon consultation, he complained of right knee instability despite proper physiotherapy. There was no locking episode of the right knee since the injury. Clinical examination showed anterior drawer test (ADT) and Lachman test were grade 3, with a positive glide on pivot shift test. Valgus and varus stress test were negative. There was no joint line tenderness, McMurray test was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right knee showed complete right ACL tear. The patient was scheduled for right ACL reconstruction surgery.\nDuring the ACL reconstruction surgery, the lateral femoral wall was perforated during insertion of the endobutton through the femoral tunnel due to over pulling. As there was no rescue endobutton (e.g. xtendobutton) available at that point of time in addition to budget constraint, we decided to use a large fragment washer to salvage this complication.\nThus, a small incision was made over the lateral aspect of the right distal thigh to insert the washer. We passed the endobutton through a large fragment washer (inner diameter 9mm), allowing the endobutton to hook on the washer over the lateral wall of the femur. Finally, the ACL reconstruction surgery was completed in the usual manner with a bioscrew at the tibial tunnel.\nPost-operatively, he was started on physiotherapy and usual ACL rehabilitation regime. He was discharged home well on post-operative day three after wound inspection.\nWe followed up the patient in the clinic at post-operative two weeks, six weeks, three months, six months and one year. Clinical examination findings at pre-operative, postoperative six weeks, three months, six months and one year are documented (). We assessed the functional status of the right knee by using Lysholm knee score at six months post-operatively.\nLysholm knee score for the patient post-operative six months was 98 (limp component 3/5) as compared to pre-operatively, which was only 69. Anterior drawer test (ADT) and Pivot shift test both were improved from grade 3 to grade 1. Post-operative radiographs of the right knee were done to confirm the placement of the endobutton and washer on the lateral femoral wall (). The patient is satisfied with the outcome of the surgery."
"A 25-year-old female with pain and swelling of the right ankle and no history of trauma reported to our outpatient clinic. Past medical history was unremarkable. Eight years ago, she noticed a painless posteromedial ankle swelling. Four years ago, she noticed occasional pain and increased swelling of the ankle during and after running, which resolved with rest. Over time, the pain started occurring while walking and occasionally during the night, which would wake her up from sleep. The American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot score was 48, while visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain was 3 while resting and 8 in movement. Physical examination revealed painful posteromedial ankle swelling (). Standing up on toes provoked pain in the right ankle. There were no noticeable skin changes. The normal range of motion in the ankle was observed, with no signs of ankle instability or impingement. There were no signs of neurovascular impairment, with negative Tinel's sign. On plain lateral radiographs, the obliteration of the Kager's fat pad was observed, with no bony deformities or malalignment. On MRI, the presence of ASM was revealed, which had a muscular insertion on the medial side of the calcaneus. As the symptoms progressed, surgery was scheduled. The procedure was performed under spinal anesthesia in a supine position with the use of a tourniquet. The incision was made just medial to the Achilles tendon proximally and extended down to the proximal border of the tarsal tunnel (). ASM was identified, bluntly dissected, and completely resected. Histopathologic analysis confirmed that the resected specimen was a skeletal muscle. Non-weight-bearing walk with two crutches was recommended for the first two weeks. After that, weight-bearing, as tolerated, was allowed in conjunction with recommended range-of-motion exercise of the ankle. Gradual return to daily activities was permitted ten weeks after the surgery. At the final follow-up six months after the surgery, the patient showed significant improvement with no complications or recurrence of symptoms and has returned to her previous level of activity. The AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot score was 90, while VAS for pain was 0 while resting and 2 in movement."
"A 25-year-old man with no prior medical history was transported to the hospital via the emergency medical service after he was stabbed with a seven-inch knife to the right thoracoabdominal area around the 10th intercostal space in the post axillary line. On arrival at the emergency department, he was alert, oriented, and reported right-sided abdominal pain. His vital signs were within normal limits, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. On physical examination, we noted a 6- to 7-cm jagged wound to the right thoracoabdominal area with profuse bleeding. The other results of his physical exam were unremarkable. No laboratory derangement was seen. Focused abdominal sonography for trauma and chest X-ray images were negative for bleeding and pneumothorax. Pressure dressing was applied to control bleeding from the wound. CT of the abdomen was obtained that revealed grade 3 hepatic laceration and no DIs (Figures , ).\nHe was taken to the operating room for diagnostic laparoscopy to rule out any other abdominal injuries. Intraoperatively, we noted right DI. A right-sided chest tube was placed, and the DI was sutured laparoscopically (Figures , ).\nControl of hepatic bleeding was achieved with hemostatic agents. The patient did well postoperatively, was extubated, and managed on the surgical floor. His chest tube was removed on postoperative day 4, and the patient was discharged to home. On follow-up visit to the clinic, the patient was doing well and asymptomatic."
"CC, a 25-year-old, had been referred to this unit after she developed erratic behavior while traveling abroad. As detailed in the summary that was brought to our attention, she was sectioned under the mental health act and upon returning to her premorbid state, she was allowed to fly back to Oman. In the discharged summary, she was given a tentative diagnosis of an acute psychotic/manic episode. She responded when prescribed with Olanzapine (10 mg BD).\nUpon arrival in Oman, she sought consultation with the present unit. The accompanying family member informed the clinical team of her distress while traveling abroad, of which CC has minimal recollection. The family informed us that she often experienced uneasiness with others and exhibited strongly inappropriate emotion and culturally devalued conduct in the last 5 years. They noted that the distress occurred periodically (approximately every 29 days) with abrupt onset during a full moon. In traditional Omani society, certain lunar cycles are thought to trigger bad omens and malevolent spirits. Her symptoms were deemed manageable by the family since they appeared to dissipate with lunar changes. Further exploration of her changed self and conduct appeared to occur during the second half of her menstrual cycle and end at the onset of menstrual bleeding.\nPremorbid, her life during childhood was uneventful. She excelled in her education, graduated with a university degree and was on the lookout for a job. CC denied having consumed any mind-altering substances including tobacco or its rejuvenated forms and alcohol. A routine urine drug screening did not reveal the presence of any illicit drugs in her system. Physical examination was unremarkable and her medical workup—including hormonal study, brain CT scan, and EEG—was inconclusive.\nCC and her family were offered the option of continuing with the same medication she was prescribed abroad. CC and her family refused the option under the pretext that the medicine (Olanzapine) left her feeling drowsy, constipated and with an insatiable appetite. The attending team labeled her of having something akin to a manic episode with psychotic symptoms. Using the ICD-10, she was registered in her medical records as having Manic episode, unspecified (F309)/brief psychotic disorder (F24) (Table ). She was also subjected to intellectual and neuropsychological evaluation (see Fig. ). CC scored 15 on the a score suggesting the presence of mild depressive symptoms."
"A 25 year old woman originally presented with marked worsening of headaches and tinnitus, papilloedema was noted. Her BMI was 35 kg/m2. The headache phenotype was migraine-like. She had a past history of episodic migraines, hypermobility, back pain, Raynaud’s syndrome, depression, low vitamin D and family history of migraines. No alternative cause of raised ICP was found on brain imaging (MRI Head and MR Venogram) and an LP was performed with an opening pressure of 35 cm CSF and the diagnosis of IIH was made []. She was given advice on weight loss and commenced on acetazolamide. Following successful weight loss her papilloedema resolved despite persistence of her chronic migraine-like headaches over 12 months. Due to resolution of papilloedema and associated side effects, acetazolamide was stopped. She had tried duloxetine for low mood with no effect on her persistent headaches. Due to risk of deteriorating mood and weight gain topiramate and tricyclics/beta-blockers were contraindicated, respectively and was commenced on erenumab. Headaches improved on erenumab (Table ) but she then developed increasing blurred vision in the context of weight gain. On examination a relapse of papilloedema was noted. Acetazolamide was commenced and weight loss advice was provided. The headaches remained controlled throughout the IIH relapse."
"A 25 year old woman (BMI of 31 kg/m2) presented with disabling increasing headaches and papilloedema was noted. The headaches had a migraine-like phenotype. She did not have any significant past medical history and no family history of migraines. Neuro-imaging (MRI Head and MR Venogram) did not reveal an alternative cause of raised ICP and an LP recorded an opening pressure of 54 cm CSF (followed by post-LP headache exacerbation for 1 week). A diagnosis of IIH was made []. She was commenced on acetazolamide and advised to lose weight. Neither acetazolamide nor topiramate were tolerated and did not improve her chronic migraine-like headaches that remained over 12 months. Following weight loss, the papilloedema resolved but migraine-like headaches persisted. Due to risk of weight gain, tricyclics and beta-blockers were contraindicated and erenumab was initiated which improved her headaches (Table ). At follow-up weight gain was noted and clinical examination revealed return of papilloedema. She was commenced on acetazolamide and advised to lose weight. Papilloedema subsequently improved. Her headaches remained controlled on erenumab despite the IIH relapse."
"A previously healthy woman in her 20s (Patient 1) spent a 2-week holiday with relatives in La Croix Valmer, France, from 13 to 31 July 2020. In the first week of August, Patient 1 stayed with other friends in another house nearby. On 1 August, she developed fever accompanied by myalgia in her calves and neck, as well as a painful skin (Day 1 of the disease episode). On Day 5 post onset of symptoms (POS), she was nauseous and vomited once. On Day 6 POS, she returned to the Netherlands. A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on a nasopharyngeal swab, was negative. On Day 8 POS, the patient noticed an itchy erythematous rash on her hands and lower legs. On Day 11 POS, she consulted her general practitioner who, suspecting petechiae, referred her to our hospital. In addition to the reported signs and symptoms, she mentioned a blurred, colourful spot in the field of vision of her left eye.\nDuring childhood, the patient was vaccinated according to the Dutch national vaccination scheme; she had never received any vaccinations for yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis or tick-borne encephalitis. Interestingly, one of her family members upon our clinical suspicion of dengue virus infection spontaneously acknowledged having seen tiger mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus) around their holiday home. Physical examination showed normal vital signs and revealed slight erythematous exanthema on her hands and upper limbs and a confluent petechiae-like exanthema on both legs. The presumptive diagnosis of dengue was made, common laboratory tests including dengue virus (DENV) serology were ordered and she was referred to the ophthalmologist. Fluorescein angiography of the eyes showed an inflammatory foveolitis in her left eye.\nLaboratory results on Day 12 POS showed a mild thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia with plasmocytosis, and moderately elevated serum levels of the liver enzymes (). On the same serum, comparative IgM and IgG serology (Immunofluorescence Arbovirus Fever Mosaic 1, EuroImmun AG, Lübeck, Germany) against chikungunya virus (CHIKV), DENV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) was performed at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) laboratory. High concentrations of DENV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies were detected (). There was a slight IgG response, without IgM response, against JEV, interpreted as non-specific cross-reactivity. RT-PCR was not done."
"We present the case of a 25-year-old right-handed male who presented with daily headaches for three weeks, which actually have been present and have been progressively increasing in intensity and frequency since he was 11. The pain was localized on the top of his head and the retro-orbital regions bilaterally and of a constant, dull, nagging nature. It was made worse with coughing, sneezing and straining, and relieved with lying down and sleep. Over the past five years, the headaches have been constant, present through the day, and have been worsened by looking up and upon standing up. He has also had difficulty concentrating. There was no history of visual changes, or changes in sleep, seizures, weakness, unsteadiness, fainting, or falls. He had been treated for tension headaches and migraines for over the same time at various clinics to no lasting effect. A cavum septum pellucidum cyst and cavum vergae were noted on a computed tomography (CT) scan during the evaluation of the headache at an outside clinic in 2015.\nOn presentation to our clinic, the examination was unremarkable with stable vitals and no focal neurological deficits.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast was ordered, which revealed a cavum septum pellucidum cyst and cavum vergae. The 3 X 3 X 1.7 cm cavum septum pellucidum cyst was seen compressing the frontal horn mid bodies of lateral ventricles. The lateral ventricles were mildly enlarged bilaterally. Sections through the foramina of Monro revealed no definite communication from the cyst to the right lateral ventricle or the third ventricle. A minimal connection was appreciated to the left lateral ventricle. Partial luminal obstruction at the level of the left foramen of Monro was appreciated. There was no evidence of hydrocephalus or midline shift. An appreciable increase in size in cavum septum pellucidum from compared to a previous scan from 2015, from 1.3 X 0.9 cm to its current dimensions of 3 X 3 X 1.7 cm, was observed (Figures , ).\nDue to the failure of pharmacological therapy, the headaches were considered to be related to the expanding CSP cyst. A neurosurgery consult was sought, and the patient proceeded to surgery via endoscopic fenestration of the cyst. Following surgery, the patient was seen at eight weeks post-op at our clinic and reported a complete resolution of the presenting symptoms, thus supporting our hypothesis."
"Patient 2 (blue curve) was a 25-year old woman with a 20-year history of TS. Current tics included sudden head movements sideways or backwards, stretching her leg and vocal tics (shouting words). She suffered from comorbid ADHD and OCD and had been successfully treated for drug addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder."
"A 25-year-old woman with severe post-burn contracture as a result of an accident suffered at the age of 10 years was qualified for a surgical treatment. Primarily, she suffered from a flame burn that affected approximately 75% of the total body surface area (TBSA). Around 65% of the TBSA was assessed as a deep, full thickness third-degree burn that required excision to the fascia and closure of wounds by meshed split thickness skin graft. The overall process of healing was severe and was prolonged by local infections. Besides the meshed skin grafts, autologous, cultured, and natural human keratinocytes (NHK) had been applied. The patient was followed up for several years after treatment. Despite the treatment of scars with compression garments, she had developed many contractures during growth and undergone a range of corrective operations as a child. After a few years’ break in the follow-up, the patient visited a plastic surgery clinic for a control examination. Being an adult woman, she presented with severe post-burn contractures and disfigurements and was qualified for a surgical experimental treatment with Integra®DRT seeded with autologous ASCs and consecutive compression therapy for prevention of scars."
"A 25-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 24 + 2 weeks of gestation was referred to our department for prenatal ultrasound examination. Prenatal ultrasound examination revealed that the foetus’ eyes were asymmetrical. The right and left eye globes measured 10.9 × 8.3 mm and 6.8 × 6.0 mm, respectively. The mean normal foetal orbital diameter is 11.0 mm at 24 weeks of gestation []. An initial diagnosis of microphthalmia was made. A hyperechoic lesion was detected in the left retro-orbital space. The lesion was crescent shaped, with a maximum thickness of about 1.6 mm (Fig. b); it was confined to the orbit and showed no proptosis. No shadowing calcifications were detected. Colour Doppler ultrasound examination demonstrated significant angiogenesis in the lesion (Fig. a). Prenatal ultrasound examinations showed no structural abnormalities other than asymmetry of the eyes, and the intracranial structure did not appear to be deformed. The head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length were consistent with the gestational age.\nAfter consultation, the patient and her husband indicated that they wanted to induce labour. Autopsy demonstrated a normal facial appearance (image could be available upon reasonable request from the corresponding author).\nHistopathological examination showed a mature orbital teratoma in the retro-orbital space (Fig. ). The teratoma was predominantly benign, with mature tissue originating in the ectoderm (epidermis and its derivatives), mesoderm (fatty tissue, blood vessels), and endoderm (gastrointestinal epithelium) (Fig. a). On immunohistochemical examination, the gland origin was confirmed by cytokeratin (CK) immunopositivity (Fig. b). The mesenchymal tissue showed diffuse and strong positive immunostaining for vimentin (Fig. c). In the mature parts of the teratoma, the cell proliferation rate determined using Ki-67 as a marker was about 10%, similarly to the level of normal tissue (Fig. d). Glypican-3 (GPC-3) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) staining were negative."
"A 25-year-old male with right ureteric colic of 3-week duration had an impacted 1.2 cm calculus at the level of L-4 in the right ureter. Ureteroscopy was done with an 8/9.8 Fr ureterorenoscope. Preliminary dilatation of the ureteric orifice was not required to enter. A relatively large stone fragment was trapped in the stone basket, but the process of withdrawal of the ureteroscope with dormia with its entrapped stone was difficult and suddenly the ureter suffered one-point avulsion at the stone impaction site. The procedure was stopped, and no further attempt was made to extricate the instruments from the ureter and was left in situ. Immediate laparotomy was made, and under vision, the stone fragment was dislodged from the basket and then instruments were delicately disengaged from the lower ureteral stump and removed without causing any further damage to the ureteral stump. The edges of the upper and lower ureteral stumps were freshened, and end-to-end uretero-ureteral anastomosis was done over a double J stent. The retrograde ureterogram done at the time of stent removal at 6 weeks showed a normal ureteral calibre."
"A 25-year-old male with history of stimulant use disorder was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility for an acute episode of agitation and disorganized behaviours to the degree of assaulting family members. Prior to admission, a thorough workup was done, and urine toxicology was unremarkable while laboratories were unrevealing of any etiology. The patient had been attending an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) geared towards addressing his substance use for the past few weeks and although his behaviour was erratic at times in the days leading up to admission, his urine toxicology was negative for all tested illicit substances.\nOn evaluation the day following admission, the patient appeared euthymic and denied all psychiatric review of symptoms elements. He disclosed struggling with sobriety from stimulants and feeling “trapped” by having to participate in the court mandated the IOP and having to comply with negative urine screens.\nPatient relates a past diagnosis of ADHD at age 16 and past treatment trials with methylphenidate and mixed amphetamine salt compounds. A few years later he was introduced to methamphetamine by a friend and discovered a more intense effect, allowing him to stay up for several days, concentrate, and have stamina. He would insufflate but also smoke it and at times use has resulted in some confusional states, abnormal perceptions and “white outs” where he would commit actions without remembering. One of these actions include a motor vehicle accident he was involved in while intoxicated and as a result he was court mandated to complete the IOP. Over the past few years he has not been able to stay away from methamphetamines and endorses extreme cravings when not available and “crashing” when coming off a few days of binging. Playing video games and engaging in sexual activity always elicits extreme cravings.\nSeveral weeks prior to presentation he read on the dark web about propylhexedrine, a methamphetamine-like compound which some users reassured would not show up on a standard drug screen. He decided to “give it a try” and began purchasing nasal decongestant inhalers from the local convenience store, taking the cotton filaments out which are soaked with the compound, and swallowing three of them at a time. Most recently he has been “parachuting” these by wrapping the cotton filaments in tissue paper prior to swallowing. This way he noted a more intense yet sustained feeling once the tissue gradually dissolves in the gastrointestinal tract and exposes the cotton filaments for absorption. He last ingested this the morning of admission to the hospital. He described the euphoric high from propylhexedrine as an intermediate between Adderall and methamphetamine."
"A 25-year-old man was referred to our hospital in 2014 for a suspected right bronchogenic cyst. He underwent a trans-esophageal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. After a few days, he started to complain of fever and acute chest pain. A contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a massive pleural effusion in the right hemithorax with complete atelectasis of the ipsilateral lung (Fig. ).\nA right thoracoscopy was performed, in order to achieve a complete debridement and drainage. During the procedure, no esophageal perforation was seen. The following clinical course was normal, so the patient was discharged on postoperative day 15.\nIn December 2019, the patient was referred to our Emergency Department because of the sudden onset of fever (39 °C) with acute chest pain. He underwent a CT-scan which revealed a suspected esophageal perforation with acute mediastinitis and right pleural effusion. A subsequent gastroscopy showed, at 35 cm from dental arch, an erosion of the esophageal wall 1,5-cm long and a 2-mm perforation with a small leak of purulent liquid. Furthermore, an endoscopic ultrasound revealed the presence of the bronchogenic cyst just outside the erosive area. Thus, a right thoracotomy with intraoperative endoscopy was performed. An esophageal perforation at the level of the cyst was found, so the right hemithorax was cleaned, the cyst was opened in order to better understand its margin, and then resected, while the esophageal wall was closed with two interrupted, absorbable stitches. A 24-Ch drain was left in place. After 2 days, salivary material appeared into the drain, so the patient underwent an EGDS, which revealed a 7-mm hole of the esophageal wall at the level of the previous suture (Fig. a). Thus, an E-Vac therapy was placed directly into the perforation (Fig. b) only during the first placement, with the aim of cleaning the mediastinum and healing the esophageal wall, which was locally compromised by the abscess. Patient’s nutrition was guaranteed by a nasojejunal feeding tube.\nThe duration of the endoscopic treatment was 17 days, the sponge was changed 5 times (Fig. c, d). After the removal of the last sponge, the patient started an oral diet without complications. One last barium swallow study showed no leak, so the patient was discharged home. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of bronchogenic cyst. At a 3-month follow-up, there was no sign of recurrence."
"A 25-year-old healthy Japanese primigravida was referred by a maternity hospital. The fetus was suspected to have either CCD or congenital intestinal atresia (CIA) based on the fetal ultrasonographic findings of polyhydramnios and dilated bowel loops. After fetal heart monitoring detected frequent severe variable decelerations, a male infant was delivered by cesarean section at 29 weeks of gestation. Birth weight was 1434 g; Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. He was the first child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. Admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was required by very low birth weight and suspected CCD. The newborn's abdomen was distended, and watery diarrhea lacking meconium passed soon after delivery. The stool had a high concentration of Cl (147 mmol/L; reference value, <90 mmol/L).(Holmberg, Perheentupa, & Launiala, ) Serum electrolytes on admission were Na, 139 mmol/L; K, 4.0 mmol/L; and Cl, 101 mmol/L. Results of venous blood gas analysis were pH, 7.363; pCO2, 35.6 mmHg; HCO3−, 19.7 mmol/L; and base excess, −4.4 mmol/L. Urinary electrolyte values were Na, 38 mmol/L; K, 4.0 mmol/L; and Cl, 37 mmol/L. Abdominal radiography ruled out intestinal obstruction. On the second day of life, he was diagnosed with CCD based on frequent watery diarrhea beginning soon after birth and high fecal chloride (Konishi et al., ; Wedenoja et al., ). Intravenous and oral replacement therapy with NaCl and KCl was administered. With treatment, serum electrolytes were maintained largely within the normal range (Table ), and general condition was good. Ninety days after birth, weighing 3168 g, he was discharged home.\nWe screened all coding exons of SLC26A3 (NCBI ref: NM_000111) including exon-intron boundaries by direct sequencing. Genetic analysis detected compound heterozygosity of SLC26A3; the 2 relevant mutations were c.382G>A, p.G128S and c.2063-1g>t. The c.2063-1g>t mutation also was present in the mother's DNA, but c.382G>A, p.G128S was absent from both parents’ samples (Figure ). Confounding paternity issues were ruled out by the presence of the rare nonpathogenic variant c.735+29del t in both the patient and his father (Figure ). Further, the common variant c.1299G>A (rs3735605) was identified in both patient and parents (Figure ), and the ABO blood groups of the patient, mother, and father respectively were types B, B, and O. Therefore, c.382G>A, p.G128S most likely represents a de novo mutation of SLC26A3."
"The proband is a 25-year-old woman with proteinuria and hematuria. She has had otitis media for more than 20 years and had a cleft lip and palate operation when she was 5 years old. She went to the hospital for hematuria over the past year. No one else in her family suffers from proteinuria, hematuria, or renal hypofunction or deafness. Urine analysis showed 3+ proteinuria and 3+ hematuria (77 red blood cells per high-power field) and a urinary protein/creatinine ratio (P/Cr) of 4.56 g/g Cr. Albumin level was 32.5 g/L, and antinuclear antibodies were negative. She had renal biopsies. Recently, she took perindopril medicine by mouth.\nInformed written consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Qilu Hospital of Shandong University."
"A 25-year-old obese female with a prior medical history of sickle cell trait presented with an initial complaint of headache for one month. The patient had never been admitted before for any sickle cell-related complications. She had localized headache to the bilateral frontal regions and described it as a constant, moderate to severe, pressure-like, and non-radiating pain. The pain worsened with ocular movement and relieved minimally with over-the-counter pain-killers. Her headache was not associated with fever, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, lacrimation, weakness, numbness, gait issues, memory problems, or any recent upper respiratory tract infection. She was the mother of one child and was not on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). No history of acute vision loss was present in the family.\nOn physical exam, she had painful ocular movements and limited visual acuity to only a slight perception of bright light. The relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) could not be assessed due to the involvement of both eyes. Later, she developed a progressive decrease in visual acuity that culminated in bilateral complete vision loss. Various investigations were done to reach an accurate diagnosis and rule out other possible diagnoses, most importantly neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). MRI of the brain and spinal cord did not reveal any pathological neuronal processes. On fundoscopic examination, she was found to have severe bilateral papilledema. Lumbar puncture revealed normal-to-slightly-raised opening pressure and aseptic meningitis-like cell count with differentials. MRI of the orbit, later on, confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral ON (Figure ). The available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen was then tested for oligoclonal bands, which also came back positive. Diagnosis of a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) was confirmed in light of the symptoms and MRI and CSF findings.\nFollowing the guidelines of Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), a landmark study for managing the acute onset of ON, we gave our patient high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone during her hospitalization. Significant improvement was noticed within the first few days of treatment initiation as determined by her ability to appreciate colors, shapes, and sources of light."
"A 25-year-old right-handed woman with no significant medical history other than migraine headaches, was evaluated by her neurologist in September 2018. She was started on topiramate ER 100 mg daily for migraine prophylaxis. In October, she started experiencing episodes of amnesia that lasted from 30 minutes to several hours. The period she was amnestic to, extended from six months to six years, in a retrograde fashion. She was completely aware of the events, and was very distressed by them. These episodes were not related to headaches and were otherwise apparently un-triggered. Frequency of these episodes started increasing progressively with increase in topiramate dose. She had a total of 20 amnestic episodes, before they ceased to happen. With a concern for seizures, she was admitted for video-electroencephalographic monitoring for three days, which was normal. MRI brain with and without contrast was also normal. Transient ischemic attack was low in the differentials since she did not have any vascular risk factors and some of these episodes lasted more than 24 hours. A tentative diagnosis of dissociative amnesia was made, and she was evaluated for symptoms of depression and other psychopathology, and none were appreciated. Since she was only taking topiramate, it was suspected to be likely related to her symptoms. She was gradually weaned off topiramate, until it was discontinued in January 2019. She had her final amnestic spell one day after the last dose of topiramate, which lasted about 45 minutes with amnesia extending back for 3.5 years. She has subsequently been completely free of the amnestic spells and is periodically following-up with us."
"A 25-year-old male with a long history of drug abuse attended a gathering of friends. He drank alcohol and smoked e-liquid and K powder at the party. During this period, he suddenly experienced shock, convulsions and tachycardia. This individual was seen by a doctor soon after and recovered without sequelae. The police found a large amount of e-liquid and K powder at the scene. According to the existing method of our forensic toxicology laboratory, the concentration of K powder in the hair was qualitatively and quantitatively determined to be 200 pg/mg (Zhuo et al., ). The concentrations of 5F-MDMB-PICA detected in the 1–3 and 4–6 cm hair sections were 275 and 1,025 pg/mg, respectively. The concentration of metabolite M7 was 2.8 pg/mg in the 1–3 cm hair section, and the concentrations of M2 and M8 were both lower than the LLOQ. In addition, the concentrations of metabolites M2 and M7 were detected in the 4–6 cm hair section at 3.0 and 5.6 pg/mg, respectively, and the concentrations of the remaining metabolites were lower than the LLOQ."
"Consider a 25-year-old male who presented at physical therapy with complaints of localized right Achilles tendon pain for the previous three months. He noted his pain originally started when he began training for his first marathon. Although he was a recreational runner, he reported that he increased, somewhat rapidly, his mileage wearing new shoes. He did not have any prior history of Achilles pain, denied any parasthesias, and did not have any symptoms beyond the middle of the Achilles tendon itself. The symptoms prevented him from running any distance, walking more than 10 min without breaks, as well as going up or down stairs, without pain. The symptoms were alleviated with rest.\nUpon examination, he had an antalgic gait with reduced push off on the right foot. Single-limb heel raises hurt when lifting up (the concentric phase) and were worse when coming down (the eccentric phase). Single-limb hopping was exquisitely painful on the right. Screening of the lumbar, hip, knee, and ankle joints did not recreate the primary symptoms. Neurodynamic assessment was normal. Localized tenderness of the right Achilles tendon 5 cm proximal to the calcaneus was noted."
"A 25-year-old Pakistani lady with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia major visited hospital for her scheduled blood transfusion during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Qatar. She had no fever, respiratory, or gastrointestinal complaints, and no travel history or sick contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Last hospital admission for blood transfusion was 2 months before. Her past medical history was remarkable for open splenectomy and cholecystectomy on 22 January 2019 as a part of the pre–bone marrow transplantation plan. On admission, vitals were temperature 37°C, blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate 18/min, heart rate 90 per min, and saturation 99% on room air. Physical examination was unremarkable. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and as per our local strategy to eliminate COVID-19 infection among the population nasopharyngeal swab to screen for COVID-19, PCR was done and tested positive with CT value (RdRp gene 26.73 and E gene 27.26) which means the patient is still contagious, as per local guidelines (CT value more than 30 is needed to consider not contagious). Thus, indicated investigations in this case were ordered.\nChest X-ray (Figure ) showed no signs of pneumonia, ECG was unremarkable with normal corrected QT and no indicators for any ischemic changes, and basic laboratory tests results were as follows (Table ): Last hemoglobulin electrophoresis was 3 months before admission. The last magnetic resonance imaging of heart and liver to assess for iron overload was on 2019 and showed only moderate iron overload in the liver.\nShe was admitted for four days and received blood transfusion as planned, and because she was diagnosed previously as COVID-19, all necessary infection control measures were taken by the medical staff, she received two units of O positive packed red blood cells without any complications, and hemoglobin increased from 8.8 mg/dL to 11.5 gm/dL. Our patient stayed in the ward to monitor her COVID-19 infection progression and reassess her after blood transfusion. She was stable for the whole hospital course, and she did not develop any respiratory symptoms or need any oxygen supplementation. No specific treatment for COVID-19 infection was offered, no anticoagulation prophylaxis was given as the patient was ambulating, and decision was made after balancing the risks and benefits. After that, she transferred to a quarantine facility. Upon discharge, the plan was to take deferasirox at dose 1080 mg daily and schedule blood transfusion appointment after 1 month. After 30 days, repeated COVID-19 PCR was negative."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred from another hospital with G2A1 36 weeks of gestational age singleton live head presentation, mother with D+W and preeclampsia with severe features. She presented initially with high-grade fever (39.8 °C) and retro-orbital pain for 2 days without either nausea or vomit. On physical examination, the blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg on anti-hypertensive agent, heart rate 83 ×/min, respiratory rate 20 ×/min, temperature 37 °C. Blood examination revealed normal haemoglobin level (12.2 g/dL), normal hematocrite level (35%), low platelet count (20,000/µL), elevated liver enzyme (AST 501 U/L and ALT 248 U/L), positive IgM, IgG dengue serology and NS1 antigen (). Patient received fluid and symptomatic therapy for the dengue and evaluation of foetal well-being through cardiotocograph. One day after admission (day 4 of fever), the cardiotocography showed suspicion two times and assessed as non-reassuring foetal status; therefore, and a caesarean section was performed. A baby girl was born, body weight was 2360 g with AS 6/8. The baby was tested for dengue transmission, and the result was that NS1, IgM, IgG dengue serology were negative. Patient was sent to ICU with mechanical ventilation of SIMV pressure support PEEP 5, FiO2 40% under midazolam sedation. Around 8 h after cesarean section (day 5 of fever), there was active vaginal bleeding around 200 mL and recurrent vaginal bleeding around 300 mL in 15 h. Patient died on day 5 of fever due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in D+W complication.\nsummarizes the characteristics of these serial cases."
"A 25-year-old lady presented with complex left parapneumonic effusion (Fig M-N) and cervical lymphadenopathy. Pleural fluid analysis as described in Table . There was no growth in blood and pleural fluid culture. Intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was initiated; however, anti-TB agents were started following histopathology of cervical lymph node that revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation. We decided for IPFT after poor drainage of pleural fluid. Three doses of sequential 16 mg alteplase and 5 mg DNase were given as per our protocol. Following that, there was an improvement of pleural drainage (Table ). Patient's general condition and cough improved and she remained afebrile. Serial imaging showed improvement (Fig O-P). She was discharged well with anti-TB therapy."
"A 25-year-old female patient known case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presented with complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. The patient had complained of palpitations for many years but it was exacerbated for three months. She also complained of shortness of breath for the last three months (New York Heart Association (NHYA) class III) and chest pain which is central in location and exacerbated on exertion. She denied a previous history of syncope, or any chronic medical disorder, or any drug history. She also denied any sudden death in her family. On examination, a young age female patient well oriented lying on the bed comfortably. Her blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg, pulse was 70 beats/min and regular, she was afebrile and her respiratory rate was 18/min. On her precordial examination, the apex beat was located at the fifth intercostal space lateral to the midclavicular line, and a double apical impulse was appreciated. On auscultation, S1 and S2 heart sounds were audible of equal intensity and there was ejection systolic murmur (Grade 4+) at the aortic area radiating to the carotid area. The basic laboratory workup is mentioned in Table . On further investigation, her electrocardiograph (Figure ) showed sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy with deep T wave inversions and ST depression depicting LVH with strain pattern. The echocardiography revealed severe asymmetrically hypertrophied left ventricle with normal function and the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The aortic valve was thickened with no calcification and there was also a subvalvular aortic membrane seen. The specific findings of echocardiography are discussed in Table . The cardiac computed tomography showed a thickened trileaflet tricommissural aortic valve with no calcification on leaflets and aorta with no significant valvular aortic stenosis. There was severe asymmetrical hypertrophied LV, and diverticulum at mid muscular septum bulging of the membranous part of the interventricular septum (IVS) towards the right ventricle (RV) and a subaortic membrane (concentric only sparing anteriorly) resulting in LVOT obstruction, the Video given below shows the details of the scan.\nThe case of this patient was discussed with the heart team and it was decided to carry out left heart catheterization first and later surgical myomectomy and resection of the subaortic membrane. But the patient requested discharge and she was kept on medical therapy with beta-blockers and advised for close follow-up."
"A 25-year-old Asian man presented to our department 2 days after a penile trauma with perineal pain and erectile dysfunction. The patient was injured during rolling over in bed and heard a “snap” sound just before pain. Physical examination showed swelling of the perineum with subcutaneous bleeding and tenderness. However, the appearance of the penis was normal. His laboratory data were within the normal limits, and hematuria was not detected on urinalysis. Ultrasonography revealed a hematoma in the perineum without any testicular injury. MRI showed a subcutaneous perineal hematoma and a 6-mm tear to the ventral tunica albuginea of the left crus penis near the bulbospongiosus muscle (Fig. ). He was diagnosed with PF associated with a penile crus injury. Six days after injury, repair of the tear at the left penile crus was performed. The transperineal approach was selected because the injured area was near the bulbospongiosus muscle. Subcutaneous bleeding expanded into his hip. However, a penis deformity was not found (Fig. ). Just before surgery, we were able to insert a 14-Fr Foley’s catheter smoothly through his urethra and no urethral injury was observed. We made a 4-cm incision in his perineum and identified the bulbospongiosus muscle after removing the hematoma. After dissecting the bulbospongiosus muscle, the corpus spongiosum of the penis was pulled to the right side using an 8-Fr flexible catheter. The trauma site of the left crus penis was revealed and repaired by interrupted sutures using 3-0 absorbable sutures (Fig. ). The day after surgery, Foley’s catheter was removed without complications. The patient had a good recovery and was discharged 6 days after surgery without postoperative complications. At the follow-up period of approximately 50 days, he did not face perineal pain, dysuria, or erectile dysfunction."
"A 25-year-old Japanese nulligravida woman was referred to our hospital to evaluate the abnormal structure of her uterus from a nearby clinic. She had no history of gynecological diseases, procedures, or uterine trauma. Her menstrual cycle was regular without any symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a myomatous mass with homogenous intensity present on the posterior uterine wall close to the internal ostium of the uterus, which shaped the inner pouch structure that was filled with a small amount of fluid (Fig. a). Upon initial examination, it appeared to be a rudimentary uterine horn; however, hysterosalpingography showed the patency of bilateral fallopian tubes connected with the fundus of the anterior uterus.\nAlthough the pregnancy was uneventful after natural conception, the myomatous mass and the pouch had become enlarged (Fig. b). At 38 + 4 gestational weeks, the patient underwent an elective cesarean delivery because the enlarged mass interfered with a vaginal delivery. Although involution of the uterus was uneventful and her menstruation did not occur during the four months after delivery, she presented at our department again with lower abdominal pain. The normal uterus was empty and about 7 cm in size. MRI showed that the myomatous mass was just as large as it was during pregnancy, and the fluid inside the myomatous mass had increased (Fig. c).\nTo improve her abdominal symptoms, she underwent laparotomy six months after delivery. During laparotomy, the uterus was completely normal with normal fallopian tubes and ovaries. A hard mass was found behind the uterus covered by thin serosa (Fig. a) and connected to the posterior uterine wall in the mid-line (Fig. b). The root of the tumor was about 3 cm in diameter. The tumor was taken out after incision of the root. The resected mass was about 18 cm in diameter and weighed approximately 1100 g. Macroscopically, the mass was a homogenous white pink hard tumor. The microscopic histological diagnosis was leiomyoma. The inner pouch space was covered with inner cervical mucosa, with inner cervical glands filled with a brownish mucosal fluid (Fig. ). The final diagnosis was uterine fibroid and diverticulum. After surgery, her abdominal symptoms resolved, and her regular menstruation resumed for six months."
"A 25-year-old black female patient was referred from a nearby town and presented to the neurology clinic of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa. Her main complaint was an insidious onset painless swelling of her left upper lip, which progressed to involve her left cheek. She had difficulty to close her left eyelid for the previous 5 days. Her past medical history was positive for two episodes of same side peripheral facial weakness. During the first attack in 2016, her symptoms resolved spontaneously without any treatment. But when it recurred 2 years later, she visited a nearby clinic and was diagnosed as a case of recurrent Bell’s palsy, which showed a complete resolution following corticosteroid treatment. She did not recall any cause or inciting factor that had induced her symptoms. She had no history of recent infection of the ear, nose, throat, sinus or dental structures. She denied any recent history of trauma to the head or neck region, skin rash or sensory symptoms. She had no personal history of sarcoidosis, Crohn’s disease, autoimmune conditions or any other chronic illness, and her family history was negative for similar conditions. She denied any history of food allergy or any other forms of allergic reactions in the past.\nOn examination, she has a diffuse, non-pitting left cheek swelling with peri-orbital fullness (Fig. a), mild left naso-labial fold flattening and fissured tongue (lingua plicata) (Fig. b). Her vitals were normal and no sensory change in the face detected. The rest of her examination was non-remarkable. Clinical and laboratory evaluations for a possible cause of recurrent peripheral facial palsy including diabetes mellitus, syphilis, Guillain–Barre syndrome, hypothyroidism, leukemia or other tumors was non-revealing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed a normal brain parenchyma and clear course of the seventh nerve (Fig. ).\nWith a high index of clinical suspicion for MRS, she was started on oral Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day with gradual tapering over 2 weeks. On the third day of treatment, her facial edema started to subside and by the end of second week all symptoms resolve and she was followed in the outpatient clinic."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a two-month history of pain and swelling of the left foot to Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India. The swelling was insidious in onset, progressive, associated with pain and difficulty in walking. There was no past or family history of tuberculosis. On examination, he had tenderness and diffuse swelling over the left second ray. There were no associated skin changes. A plain radiograph of the left foot showed an expansile lytic lesion of the metaphyseo-diaphyseal region of the base of the second metatarsal bone (Figure ). Bone scintigraphy showed an increased tracer activity in the second metatarsal base without the involvement of any other region of the body. Blood parameters, which included calcium/phosphorus/alkaline phosphatase/parathyroid hormone, were within normal limits. The inflammatory markers were not done initially.\nSurgical procedure\nStaged treatment was planned for the patient. In the first stage, he underwent excision biopsy of the lesion, extended curettage with speed burr, and chemical cauterization with 80% phenol. The curetted area was filled with antibiotic-loaded bone cement consisting of 1 gram each of vancomycin and meropenem (Figures -). Perioperatively, the lesion was appearing like an atypical GCT. The tissue sample was sent for bacterial and fungal cultures and biopsy. The biopsy was reported as a giant cell-rich lesion, consistent with GCT. The GeneXpert® TB polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the tissue sample without rifampicin resistance. He was started on treatment for tuberculosis by a standard four-drug protocol of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for two months in the intensive phase and isoniazid and rifampicin for 10 months in the continuous phase. Pyridoxine was given along with these drugs for the same period.\nThe second stage of treatment was started after the completion of the full course of anti-tubercular therapy. The metatarsal base was again exposed through the previous incision, and the cement bead was removed. Swabs were taken from the area and sent for cultures. The defect at the metaphyseo-diaphyseal part was measured, and the cortico-cancellous graft was taken from the iliac crest and press-fitted into the defect. Cultures were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nAfter surgery, the patient was given a below-knee cast and started on weight-bearing as tolerated. The patient was being followed up in the outpatient department (OPD) regularly for three years, and the radiographs showed complete integration of the bone graft without any recurrence to date (Figures -)."
"A 25-year-old hypertensive man presented with a history of skin thickening mainly on the face and scalp from the age of 14 years associated with prominent skin wrinkles and folds (Figure ). He also presented with joint edema in the hands and knees and finger clubbing. His main complaint was premature aging of his face, specifically the wrinkles in the frontal region. He had previously received botulinum toxin injections with unsatisfactory results. Preoperative examinations did not reveal any changes. Placement of a rectangular tissue expander was proposed to thin the skin and reduce the depths of the skin wrinkles and folds that are characteristic of the syndrome (Figure ).\nSubperiosteal lifting was chosen, as the disease pathophysiologically manifests with thickened periosteum. In an attempt to thin the skin and decrease the prominent wrinkles and folds that are characteristic of the disease, as well as achieve greater and improved lengthening of the forehead skin over time compared with the punctual lengthening achieved via surgery, a rectangular expander measuring 8.5 × 5 cm with a 200 mL volume was initially placed on the forehead in a submuscular position. Slow and gradual expansion was then performed until the 200 mL volume was filled (Figure ). Six months after the placement of the expander, the patient underwent a subperiosteal frontal lift, wherein a precapillary incision was made, the expander and its capsule were removed, and multiple incisions were made in the forehead flap to improve stretching. Resection of the thickened periosteum, superior flap traction, and removal of the excess skin were also performed, maintaining the previous capillary line."
"A 25-year-old male presented with dysphagia due to accidental ingestion of a corrosive substance leading to esophageal stricture. He had undergone serial endoscopic dilatations of stricture for three months. However, due to persistent stricture and progressive dysphagia, he was referred to the surgical department. His upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed a non-passable stricture 25 cm from the incisors. Barium swallow test revealed a stricture in the thoracic esophagus.\nAfter preoperative evaluation, a retro-sternal gastric pull-up was performed, with the native esophagus being retained in situ and the lower end of the esophagus was stapled in the abdomen. A side-to-side anastomosis of cervical esophagus was performed with a gastric tube in the neck with the presumption of complete obliteration of esophageal lumen (Figure ).\nExcision of the diseased native esophagus was not attempted. A feeding jejunostomy was performed.\nOn post-operative day 7, the patient was put on a liquid diet after confirming a patent neck anastomosis by oral gastrograffin. The patient tolerated normal diet for two days. On day 9, the patient developed fever, tachypnea and pus discharge from the main abdominal wound. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan of the chest and abdomen revealed a 3 x 5 cm intraabdominal collection and disruption of intraabdominal esophageal staple line (Figure ).\nA subsequent upper GI endoscopy revealed a normal gastroesophageal anastomotic site and the pulled-up stomach; however, his native esophagus was found leaking into the abdomen (Figure ).\nA persistent leak from the opened stapled esophagus resulted in a large intraabdominal fluid collection. The patient was initially managed with an ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and enteral nutrition via feeding jejunostomy. But the catheter drain output continued indicating persistent a leak.\nAs the general condition of the patient did not improve, a cervical re-exploration and a complete surgical exclusion of the esophagus was performed (Figure ). There were significant adhesions in the neck region. In the post-operative period, the patient developed esophagogastric anastomotic leak in the neck, which was managed conservatively by the opening of wound and dressing. Oral feeding was continued with digital compression applied over the wound site. The leak healed within 10 days. On follow-up at three months, the patient was free from dysphagia and had gained adequate weight."
"A 25-year-old woman with no significant co-morbidities presented to our outpatients clinic with right breast hypoplasia. Overlying the hypoplastic breast on the right thoraco-mammary region, an irregular, hyperpigmented macular lesion was noted. The underlying pectoralis major muscle, latissimus dorsi, nipple and areola were normal. According to the patient, the hypermelanosis had been present since puberty with no significant change in the size or degree of pigmentation. No other anomaly was detected and the patient had no family history of note. A clinical diagnosis of Becker naevus syndrome was made.\nFollowing discussion surrounding the possible treatment options, the decision was made to manage the breast hypoplasia with liposuction and autologous fat grafting. The procedure was carried out in two sessions, 17 months apart.\nThe donor site was infused with 500 ml tumescent solution of Hartmann’s, 1.25 mg/ml chirocaine, 1 ml of 1:1000 adrenaline and 1500 IU hyaluronidase. Fat was harvested from the flanks and lower abdomen using power-assisted liposuction.\nThe harvested fat was processed to eliminate tumescent fluid, blood, cell fragments and oil. Lipoaspirate was processed using the Revolve system (LifeCell, Bridgewater, NJ). Fat was infiltrated into the hypoplastic breast using a blunt Coleman infiltration cannula, from deep to superficial while retracting the cannula. A 300 ml concentrate was infiltrated in the first procedure, whereas a 150 ml concentrate was infiltrated in the second procedure.\nThe injection points and liposuction areas were closed using a 4-0 absorbable suture. The areas were dressed with omnistrips and mepore. A supportive bra was applied. No post-operative complications were noted. Considerable improvement in breast symmetry and degree of pigmentation was evident on follow-up with a high degree of patient satisfaction ()."
"Case 1: A 25-years-old woman presented with hyperpigmented macules and maculopapular rash on her lower limbs for 4 years. The lesions were located mainly in the lower legs, which progressed slowly to the thighs and arms, with moderate pruritus. On physical examination, macular hyperpigmentation in a rippling pattern were observed over her limbs, and hyperkeratotic brownish papules in some areas. The patient was otherwise well, with no other skin symptoms or extracutaneous discomfort. The initial clinical diagnosis was consistent with PCA changes, which was more in line with biphasic amyloidosis (because the lesions had both the characteristics of macular amyloidosis and lichen amyloidosus) (). Case 2: A 65-years-old woman presented with a 10-year history of tan macules and papules on her back, with a medical history of cardiac disease. The lesions were persistent itching, without other skin discomfort. Physical examination revealed brownish macules fused in a grid pattern. We diagnosed it as macular amyloidosis ()."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of bilateral eye redness, irritation, and tearing. One month prior to presentation, he was treated with a course of moxifloxacin eye drops but symptoms recurred 2 days thereafter. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 using a nasopharyngeal specimen collected and analyzed via RT-PCR (LabCorp Inc., Raritan, NJ) in March 2020.\nOn exam, the patient had normal vision and intraocular pressure in both eyes and one 1.0 mm follicle on the right inferior tarsal of the right eye (OD) without discharge or injection. The left eye (OS) had one 1.5 mm follicle on the left inferior tarsal and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. There was bilateral bulbar and palpebral conjunctival injection.\nPast medical history included a history of LASIK and genital herpes controlled with oral valacyclovir.\nA 19-year-old male presented with 1-month history of irritation and tearing in the left eye (OS) and redness in bilateral eyes (OU). The patient was initially treated with ciprofloxacin eye drops and erythromycin ointment, but his condition continued to worsen. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 using a nasopharyngeal specimen collected and analyzed via RT-PCR. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 via RT-PCR (Abbott Laboratories Inc., Lake Forest, IL) July 2020.\nOn exam, visual acuity was 20/60 bilaterally with normal intraocular pressure and bilateral redness of the bulbar conjunctiva. A prominent follicular reaction of the lower conjunctiva was seen, and superficial episcleral injection in both eyes without pain was noted ().\nBoth patients had conjunctival biopsy and were tested for coinfections of chlamydia, HSV, adenovirus, and gonorrhea (). Biopsy of the left eye revealed benign epithelium with subepithelial tissue showing reactive lymphoid hyperplasia highlighted with B and T cell immunostains CD20 and CD3, respectively."
"A 25-year-old male Filipino patient came to the A&E department complaining of seizures, his laboratory blood tests were normal. Non-contrast CT scan of the head showed multiple bilateral cerebral cortical and subcortical hyperdense linear and nodular lesions, consistent with parenchymal calcifications, surrounded by hypodense vasogenic edema, involving the left frontal, left occipital and bilateral parietal lobes ().\nMRI was then undertaken for better characterization of the parenchymal abnormalities and showed multiple lesions with linear and nodular post i.v. contrast enhancement surrounded by areas of vasogenic edema ().\nExcision brain biopsy was done, and pathological examination of the specimen showed granuloma formation around characteristic Schistosoma japonicum ova with absence of protruding spine."
"A 25-year-old Filipino lady, presented to the emergency department complaining of a 1 day history of left-sided lower limb weakness causing walking difficulty, associated with moderate headache radiating to the back of the neck, but otherwise no other associated symptoms.\nShe was admitted to the hospital, where she had tonic clonic seizures followed by confusion, headache, and vomiting. Her past medical history was unremarkable.\nPlain CT head showed left frontal parasagittal cortical swelling with mild increased density and associated subcortical vasogenic edema (). MRI scan of the brain showed a frontal cortical lesion with typical arborized branching linear and nodular post contrast enhancemment pattern, surrounded by vasogenic edema (), which was highly suggestive of schistosomiasis, with differential consideration of brain primary or metastasis being less likely.\nPlain CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (not shown) was also undertaken as a workup of possible malignancy with brain metastasis. And showed nodular urinary bladder wall and calcified capsular liver lesions suggestive of chronic schistosomiasis. The patient denied any urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms, but she gave history that she used to play and drink from local river back home in her childhood.\nSchistosoma antibody (Ab) titer was positive at 1:160. And urinary bladder wall biopsy was consistent with schistosomiasis. Given the above imaging and clinical background the diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis of the brain was entertained, and treatment for schistosomiasis was started, and she received a single dose 40 mg/kg Praziquantel, and she was discharged on oral levetiracetam (Keppra) and prednisolone for seizure control.\nOn 2 weeks clinical follow-up visit, the patient showed dramatic clinical improvement, and follow-up MRI showed significant resolution of the enhancing brain lesions, and decreased vasogenic edema ()."
"A 25-year-old male presented with paresthesia (tingling and numbness) of the right upper limb, followed by bilateral progressive upper and lower limb heaviness and weakness evolving over a period of 3 months. Physical examination demonstrated large cutaneous port wine stains (capillary vascular malformations) involving the right side of the chest, the nape, and along the ventrolateral aspect of the whole right upper limb distal to the thumb in a dermatomal distribution, with no size discrepancy between both upper limbs (). The cutaneous vascular malformations were present at birth and were growing proportionally with the patient without regression. The patient reported initial improvement of the port wine stains on his hand after laser treatment but the lesions later recurred. Neurologically, the patient demonstrated reduced muscle strength (Grade 3/5) of both hands and legs and decreased sensation (Grade 4/5) globally from his C3 dermatome down. He was hyperreflexic in the lower extremities. Physical examination of the rest of the body was unremarkable. No family history of similar illness."
"A 25 years old man came to Emergency Room with strangulated penile by a metal ring since 18 h ago. He complained unable to urinate and severe pain. Physical examination showed the shaft of penis, which was distal to the ring, was edematous and congested. The glans and distal shaft were reported to be viable.\nA pliers was used to cut the ring. A gauze was used to cover skin below to prevent more laceration. Following removal, the penile edema began to resolve and no signs of necrosis or damage to the penis were noted. Patient was followed-up on day 30 after procedure, voiding function was normal and Erection Hard Score (EHS) was 4 ()."
"A 25 year old male pilot presented to UK medical services on 3rd of August 2019 with symptoms of pain and paraesthesia of both legs, and difficulty passing urine. He was found to be in urinary retention with a residual volume of 1 litre and was catheterised. He reported travel to Uganda in March 2017 on a military expedition during which he canoed from Lake Victoria along the White Nile and was in contact with river water. No advice on schistosomiasis prevention was given before the trip and no screening for schistosomiasis was undertaken after the trip. During his admission he was found to have a varying peripheral blood eosinophil count (range 0.0 to 0.6x10^9/L). MRI spine performed on 9th August 2019 showed high abnormal T2/STIR signal in the spinal cord from T7-T11 (). He was initially diagnosed and treated as a case of inflammatory transverse myelitis, receiving 5 days of intravenous methylprednisolone in August 2019. CSF analysis demonstrated an elevated protein of 0.7g/L and WCC of 132 (81% lymphocytes). CSF schistosomal ELISA was positive (OD 1.7, cut off 0.26). CSF glucose was not available at time of writing. Serum schistosomal serology performed at another laboratory was positive (ELISA positive at 8.8, cut off 1.2; IgG confirmed on Western blot). After discussion with the parasitology team at the HTD, he commenced a 3 day course of praziquantel (60mg/kg/day) in September 2019 alongside a 3 day course of 60mg prednisolone followed by a steroid wean over 66 days. The diagnosis was confirmed in the Neuroparasitology MDT. At 8 months’ follow up he requires ongoing intermittent self-catheterisation for improving but ongoing urinary retention. He retains reduced left ankle dorsiflexion (MRC grade 4+/5) and bilaterally absent ankle jerks. He requires the occasional use of a stick to aid walking. He has improved but ongoing subjectively altered sensation of bowel movements. The length of time from exposure to freshwater in a schistosomal endemic region and symptom onset was 29 months. Length of time from initial UK presentation to commencing appropriate anti-parasitic treatment was 44 days. No specific adverse effects from medication were reported for this patient."
"A 25-year-old athletic man, admitted to a private clinic with a diagnosis of contusive right knee trauma with complete rupture of the proximal middle third anterior cruciate ligament, underwent surgical ligament reconstruction with autologous patellar tendon, medial meniscectomy after chemoprophylaxis with 2 g of cefazolin.\nThen, 11 days after surgery, the patient presented with intense pain associated with fever and evidence of edema and erythema of the medial face of the thigh, knee, and right leg. Arthrocentesis revealed corpuscular fluid positive for MSSA (M1 strain); consequently, the patient was treated with teicoplanin 800 mg and rifampicin 600 mg. Despite the antimicrobial therapy, the fever and inflammation persisted, hence the switch to 850 mg daptomycin + 750 mg levofloxacin + 4.5 g × 4 days tazobactam-piperacillin and a second surgery after 4 days—revealing the presence of fibrinoid tissue incorporating the neoligament, the screws of both the tibial and femoral graft and the meniscal root button—with all new cultures positive for S. aureus.\nNext, 5 days after the second surgery, the persistence of inflammation, pain and fever, together with repeated isolation of MSSA from joint drainages (M2 strain)—even though in the presence of negative blood cultures—determined a new change in the antimicrobial therapy: first to daptomycin 850 mg and linezolid 600 mg × 2 days, and then to linezolid suspension. Nevertheless, the patient remained febrile and with persistent knee inflammation. Finally, 25 days after the second surgery, the new arthrocentesis revealed negative cultures, determining a new change in therapy, with discontinuation of daptomycin and initiation of dalbavancin infusions. The patient repeatedly underwent arthroscopic arthrolysis with biopsy samples negative for cultures.\nA timeline of M1 and M2 MSSA isolation in relation to the surgeries and treatment regimens is shown in ."
"A 25-year-old, right-hand-dominant female presented with a progressively enlarging mass along the ulnar border of her right ring finger. The mass extended proximally from her proximal phalanx to her middle phalanx, ~2 x 2 cm in size. The mass was soft, mobile, with no overlying skin changes. No pain, tenderness, paresthesias, or bruit were noted. There was no history of trauma. MRI was obtained and demonstrated a lobulated lipoma on the volar and ulnar aspect of the right ring finger extending from the proximal phalanx to the distal aspect of the middle phalanx (Figure , Figure , Figure , Figure ).\nSurgical excision was recommended, which the patient deferred at that time. The mass continued to enlarge over the next two years with the onset of worsening pain and paresthesias. Repeat MRI confirmed the diagnosis of intraneural lipoma of the ulnar digital nerve of the patient’s right ring finger. The patient agreed to surgical intervention.\nUpon exploration, the mass appeared to be a large, multilobulated, serpiginous, fibrofatty tumor consistent with an intraneural lipoma along the entire volar ulnar surface of the ring finger (Figure ).\nThe lipoma was intimately associated and intertwined with the ulnar digital nerve, extending from the level of the A1 pulley proximally to the level of the distal interphalangeal joint distally. The ulnar digital artery was displaced by the mass. Meticulous dissection was undertaken to enucleate the intraneural lipoma, safeguarding against any injury to the ulnar digital nerve. The resection yielded a 9-cm multilobulated, serpiginous mass with no residual lesion (Figure ).\nAfter meticulous dissection to completely excise the intraneural lipoma, the ulnar digital nerve remained intact with noted areas of the previous compression (Figure ).\nGross pathological examination of the specimen revealed a large, encapsulated mass comprised of fibroadipose tissue consistent with an intraneural lipoma. Postoperatively, the patient experienced some mild paresthesias along the ulnar aspect of her right ring finger, which did resolve over time. No strength or range-of-motion deficits were observed. Full recovery was achieved by the patient."
"A 25-year-old male with a history of well-controlled gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) presented to the emergency room for evaluation of one week of severe odynophagia and inability to tolerate po. He had been treated with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) for several years with good effect. Approximately 2 months prior to presentation, he started vaping tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nicotine with recent heavy daily use. He denied any alcohol or NSAID intake. On physical exam, the patient was non-toxic appearing with a soft abdomen.\nWe performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy that revealed Los Angeles Grade C esophagitis (involving ≥ 1 mucosal breaks continuous between tops of ≥ 2 mucosal folds, < 75% circumferential) (Fig. ). Histopathological analysis of esophageal biopsies demonstrated granulation tissue with acute and chronic inflammation (Fig. ). Periodic acid-Schiff-diastase staining was negative and immunohistochemical stains for herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus were negative. There was no evidence of eosinophilic esophagitis. He was diagnosed with esophagitis secondary to vaping. We treated him with intravenous 40 mg twice daily PPI and analgesics until he was able to tolerate oral intake. He was counseled extensively on vaping cessation. The patient reported complete resolution of symptoms after 2 months of PPI therapy and vaping cessation."
"A 25-year-old pregnant female with a second trimester dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy and past medical history of ulcerative colitis, seizure disorder, anemia, and cholelithiasis presented from an outside hospital with severe colicky right upper quadrant abdominal pain and associated nausea. She had additional past obstetric history of G14P4184, specifically fourteen pregnancies, four live children and multiple fetal losses. Her pain and nausea symptoms were unrelieved with frequent and typical opiate and antiemetic doses. Outside imaging was unavailable, yet, according to the report, there was a negative right upper quadrant ultrasound without signs of cholecystitis.\nA non-contrast magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and MRI abdomen/pelvis with DWI sequences were utilized for urgent evaluation of her abdominal pain. MRCP with DWI was negative for biliary tree or gall bladder pathology. On the MRI abdomen exam, as seen in Figure , the T1-weighted fat-suppressed image reveals the normal anatomy of the left adrenal gland while the right is diffusely edematous and hypointense.\nCorrespondingly, in Figure , the right adrenal gland is enlarged and edematous with notable periadrenal and perirenal high signal fluid. There is a mixed-signal appearance of the right adrenal gland indicating parenchymal edema. Whereas the adrenal glands are expected to restrict diffusion similar to the spleen or the contralateral adrenal gland, imaging from DWI images show greater than expected diffusion restriction within the right adrenal gland, confirmed with ADC maps (Figures , ). B-values of 50 and 500 were used to calculate the ADC map. In comparison, the left adrenal gland and spleen are evaluated with region of interest (ROI) measurements of approximately 1000 units. The infarcted adrenal gland measures at 874 units, indicating greater restricted diffusion due to infarcted parenchyma. The findings of edema, swelling, and greater restricted diffusion were considered diagnostic of right adrenal gland infarct [,,-].\nOur patient’s hospital course followed with a complete hypercoagulability panel, hematology/oncology and endocrinology consultations. She was started on prophylactic low molecular weight heparin. Of note, abnormal laboratory findings included an elevated antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) ratio 1:80 and protein C activity of 67%. She improved during her hospital stay with relief of abdominal pain and was discharged on low molecular weight heparin."
"A previously healthy, 25-year-old male presented to our outpatient department with a four-day history of intermittent high-grade fever followed by a two-day history of vomiting, yellowing of sclera, decreased oral intake, malaise, and hoarseness of voice. There was no history of cough, flu-like symptoms, neck pain, or rash. On examination, scleral icterus, mild right hypochondrium tenderness on deep palpation, and hepatomegaly were noted. The liver had smooth margins and was firm in consistency. No splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Neurological examination was unremarkable with no altered mentation or neurological deficits. Cranial nerve examination was normal. He had normal tongue movements and the uvula was central. The sensory and motor functions of limbs were intact.\nHe was admitted for evaluation and his baseline laboratory investigations were ordered. He was started on supportive treatment with intravenous fluids and anti-emetics. His blood work revealed alanine aminotransferase 1,650 U/L (normal range: 0-42 U/L), alkaline phosphate 1,085 U/L (normal range: 65-300 U/L), and serum total bilirubin 191 µmol/L (normal range: 0-17 µmol/L). His blood count, coagulation profile, and renal function test were within normal limits. Serology for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies for hepatitis C were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed hepatomegaly. Serology for hepatitis A revealed significant titers for IgM depicting an acute hepatitis A infection.\nPertaining to his hoarseness, it was initially attributed to persistent vomiting, but when it continued even after his vomiting was settled, he was referred to the otolaryngology team who planned a fiberoptic direct laryngoscopy (FODL). Examination via FODL revealed left vocal cord paralysis (Video ). No other abnormality or growth was detected. A further probe into the cause of this lesion was carried out. This was the first presentation with hoarseness and he had never had such symptoms in the past. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the neck and chest was carried out which revealed no lesions.\nHe clinically improved and his serial liver function tests showed improvement. He was discharged on symptomatic treatment. He was called for a follow-up six weeks later. Upon follow-up, his liver function tests had almost normalized but his hoarseness persisted. He was called for a second follow-up at three months and offered a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to look for any pathology. The MRI study was also normal. He was then advised a further follow-up at six months."
"A 25-year-old primigravida with a history of pre-eclampsia was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe headache. The headache started two days after delivery. It was followed by confusion and loss of consciousness over a few hours. On initial evaluation, the patient was confused with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12/15, blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 82 beats/min, respiratory rate of 30/min, temperature 98°C, and oxygen saturation of 97 mmHg at room temperature. On physical examination, bilateral equivocal planters were noted with no other significant findings, and bilateral papillary edema on fundoscopy was seen. The rest of the review system was unremarkable. She underwent an urgent MRI with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) of the brain, which showed right transverse sinus thrombosis with an element of SAH (Figure ).\nCoagulation profile, including thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), antithrombin III, fibrinogen, proteins C and S, antiphospholipid antibody titers, and homocysteine levels, were normal. She was started on a half dosage of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (60 mg subcutaneously once a day) with regular monitoring of her blood pressure and GCS. Her GCS started improving; therefore, she was continued on a half dose of LMWH for 10 days, and brain MRI was repeated after 10 days, which showed the gradual resolution of SAH (Figure ). The quantity of LMWH was doubled, and warfarin was started after a full dose of LMWH. After improving her GCS and achievement of international normalized ratio (INR) of two to three, she was discharged with the advice of regular INR monitoring and follow-up to the outpatient department. On follow-up at six weeks, MRI with MRV was repeated, which showed thrombosis had resolved, although a mild filling defect was noted. She was kept on anticoagulants for one year, and on further follow-up at six months, she was doing well."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department 2 months post-LSG with an unremarkable postoperative course. At presentation, he had a left upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with repeated vomiting, subjective fever, generalized body aches, and cough for two weeks. The cough was productive of greenish sputum with a tinge of blood and provoked by any oral intake. A review of other systems was unremarkable.\nPhysical exam shows the following: RP 103 BPM, BP 129/70, RR 18, SpO2 99%, and temperature: 36.4°C. Abdomen examination shows soft and lax, mild generalized tenderness especially in epigastrium, normal bowel sounds. Chest examination shows no increased work of breathing, normal chest expansion, percussion note slight dullness in the left lower zone, chest sounds decreased breathe sounds in the left lower zone with bronchial breathing, and fine crackles.\nDiagnostic testing shows the following: WBC: 8.5 × 103/μL (normal range 4-10 × 103/μL), CRP: 6.7 mg/L (normal range 0-5 mg/L); blood and sputum culture were negative.\nInitial chest radiograph () showed a left lower lung zone heterogeneous opacity silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm and left retrocardiac air lucency. A follow-up CT scan of the abdomen () was done to rule out an intra-abdominal fluid collection (oral contrast was not given as the patient was intolerant of oral intake) and showed a left lower lobe consolidation with cavitation and tract connecting it with the gastric remnant lumen. The gastroenterology team was consulted, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) confirmed the presence of a large fistula orifice just below the gastroesophageal junction ().\nFor more anatomic delineation of gastrobronchial fistula, an upper GI study with water-soluble contrast () was performed which showed contrast leakage extending upwards from the gastric remnant into the left lung base with contrast opacification of the left lower lobe peripheral bronchial branches.\nAfter confirmation and proper surgical planning of gastrobronchial fistula, bariatric surgery was intervened by the laparoscopic approach. The operative technique was resection of the fistula (found connected to GE junction) and gastrojejunal anastomosis. The patient had a successful postoperative recovery."
"A 25-year-old female patient has been diagnosed having asthma and rhinitis for 5 years. She frequently admitted to the emergency room due to dyspnoea and cough increasing in the last 1 year although she received high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long acting bronchodilation (LABA), theophilline, montelukast, anti-histamine drugs and nasal steroid. Even adding 32 mg of steroid treatment, eosinophil level, FEV1 (forced expiratory volume), PEF (peak expiratory force) were 900 cell/mcL, 81%, and 69 lt/min, respectively. Total IgE was 146 IU/ml and the asthma control test (ACT) score was 8. Skin prick test for inhalant allergens and specific IgE for inhalant allergens (mixture of mite, mould and grasses) were negative. She had frequent exacerbations requiring emergency department visit despite regular use of high dose ICS, LABA, montelukast, anti-histamine drugs and oral corticosteroids (OCS). She had no smoking history. High resolution computed tomography showed no tumoral, infectious or vasculitic abnormality. Even she had desired pregnancy for 3 years, she was unable to have a baby, and had been diagnosed having primary infertility without any identifiable causes other than asthma. Although she took progesterone and clomifen citrate, no pregnancy was occurred. Planned IVF (in vitro fertilization) treatment was postponed because of severe asthma attacks. Mepolizumab was started, considering the patient as having severe asthma. After first dose of mepolizumab, eosinophil level, PEF and FEV1 were 100 cell/mcL (1.2%), 73 lt/min, 73% respectively. Asthma control test score was 24. No side effects were seen. Before the third dose of mepolizumab treatment, she had pregnancy of 5 weeks gestational age. She decided to give birth despite the difficulty of the situation. Mepolizumab treatment was ended because there are insufficient data regarding the use of mepolizumab during pregnancy. She started to receive 32 mg of prednisone treatment at the end of 12 weeks. Even receiving high dose steroid and LABA treatment, she had 2 severe attacks during her pregnancy. Due to increased severity of asthma (ACT 8), dyspnoea, cough and eosinophil level of 1800 cell/mcL (24%), she restarted to receive mepolizumab treatment after giving birth. Her dyspnoea was improved, and ACT score is increased to 21 although cessation of steroid treatment by herself. The pregnancy was ended up with a healthy baby without any congenital anomalies."
"A 25-year old female with the Noonan syndrome and a right-sided aortic arch, was referred for cardiac screening due to an active pregnancy wish. Echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart. For better visualization of the thoracic aorta she underwent CTA () that confirmed the right-sided aortic arch and showed a left aberrant subclavian artery and a Kommerell’s diverticulum of 19 × 21 mm. The trachea and esophagus were only mildly compressed. In the absence of symptoms and a good exercise capacity (160 Watt at bicycle exercise testing) a watchful waiting strategy was pursued and the patient was advised to avoid maximal exercise. The patient is under periodic follow-up."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a large, single left cervical lymph node, measuring 3 cm, since 3 months. Clinical diagnosis was hemangioma or paraganglioma. It was firm, mobile and non-tender. FNAC and subsequent histology of both the cases were similar."
A 25-year-old paraplegic male patient was referred with grade IV sacral pressure sore []. The sacral defect was reconstructed using a superior gluteal artery perforator-based propeller flap []. There were no post-operative complications [].
"A 25-year-old Saudi female was presented to Neuro-ophthalmology clinic at King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, complaining of a gradual vision decrease in the right eye since seven years. During this period, she has been seen in many hospitals and treated with different eye drops. There was no previous history of eye pain, eye trauma or any medical disorders. Recently, she complained of marked deterioration of vision in the right eye with a history of mild intermittent headache. On examination, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 2/200 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Extraocular eye movement was normal, saccade and pursuit was normal with no nystagmus. Cranial nerve examination was also found to be normal. The pupillary reaction was sluggish to direct light with relative afferent papillary defect in the right eye and normal in the left eye. Slit lamp examination of the anterior segment was normal in the both eyes. The fundscopic examination showed optic atrophy with retinochoroidal collateral (optociliary shunt) in the right eye and the left optic disc showed mild temporal pallor (). Humphrey visual field was done and it showed marked generalized constriction of the visual field in the right eye and mild peripheral visual field depression in the left eye.\nPost contrast T1-weighted MR image axial MRI with fat saturation (Fig –) showed tubular growth pattern of bilateral optic nerve sheath meningioma as diffuse enhancement along the length of the left intraconal optic nerve sheath (black arrows). Optic nerve is seen as central linear hypointensity in comparison to enhanced meningioma on either side, producing the tram-track sign with extensive enhancement along the RT intracanalicular optic nerve sheath (white arrows) with en-plaque growth along the walls of the sulcus chiasmaticus, giving a “rose thorn” appearance(black long arrow). Contrast-enhanced coronal and sagittal T1-weighted MR image, with fat suppression through the optic nerve in the midorbit (Fig –), illustrates enhancing mass affecting the RT planumsphenoidale and inferior orbital fissures with en-plaque growth of tumor within the right optic nerve sheath. The left side meningioma is limited to the sulcus chiasmaticus and orbital apex.\nNon-contrast coronal and axial CT images (Fig –) clearly detect the linear calcification along the optic nerve sheath - suggestive of a tram track appearance with mild hyperostosis. CT and MRI confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral optic nerve sheath meningioma."
"A 25-year-old Arabic female patient from the United Arab Emirates developed a right parotid mass lesion that was otherwise completely asymptomatic and of a stable size. She had no history of head and neck radiation treatment or a personal or family history of salivary neoplasms, but she was in the second trimester of her first pregnancy. Initially, the patient did not seek medical attention, but because of the progressive increase of the size of her parotid mass lesion, she obtained a referral to a head and neck surgeon. Her medical assessment, which included cytologic studies, indicated that the mass lesion was due to an acinic cell carcinoma.\nThe patient was managed surgically in the form of a right superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the ipsilateral facial nerve.\nThe patient remained well and had no recurrence of her malignant disease until four years later, when she became pregnant again. During the third trimester of her pregnancy, she developed a new mass lesion at the same site as her previous parotidectomy, which proved to be a recurrent acinic cell carcinoma. She also had a right submandibular malignant lymphadenopathy. The size of the recurrent acinic cell carcinoma and the ipsilateral malignant cervical lymphadenopathy progressively increased until the end of her pregnancy. The function of both facial nerves was intact. All investigations were essentially unremarkable, and no evidence of distant metastases or contraindications for surgical treatment were present. Her CT scan confirmed the presence of the recurrent mass lesion of the right parotid gland (Figure ).\nThe multidisciplinary management of this patient consisted of a right total parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve (Figure ) and an ipsilateral radical neck dissection followed by postoperative external-beam radiotherapy. The final histopathologic assessment confirmed the diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma (Figure ).\nThe patient recovered from her treatment and was subsequently managed with close surveillance. Her disease has been well controlled until the time of this report, and she has had no recurrence of her acinic cell carcinoma."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital with a two-day history of lower quadrant abdominal pain. She had no fever, but she reported nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Her McBurney's point was positive with abdominal guarding and rigidity. She had no relevant gynaecological history.\nThe patient's white blood cell count was 12,400/mm3 with 83% neutrophils. Her urine analysis was normal, and her urine pregnancy test was negative. Acute appendicitis was diagnosed, and an appendectomy was performed. Intraoperatively, the appendix appeared mildly congested. The appendix measured 6.5 × 0.6 cm at the widest diameter. The pathological examination revealed small nodules found in the wall of the appendix. The patient's ectopic endometrial glands were surrounded by endometrial stroma (Figure ). The pathology report led to the diagnosis of appendiceal endometriosis. Postoperatively, the patient recovered with no residual pain. Today, five years after the patient's appendectomy, her gynecologic anamnestic record remains clear and her follow-up with echograms has revealed no other sites of endometriosis."
"A 25-year-old woman, nulligravida, was divorced 5 years ago and was nondiabetic patient. Because of some Upper Egypt traditions she refused to go to doctors (as approximately all surgeons in our localities are male). She had a severe itching with severe monilia infection, and she consulted only dermatologic doctors, the conditions worsened till complete adhesion occured leading to urine retention with difficulty in micturition, then urine retention with overflow. On taking the history, she was circumcised as a routine procedure done for young female in villages and rural area in Upper Egypt. On examination she had a complete vulval adhesion with only pinhole opening for micturation with complete adhesion of the labia and overflow of the urine with some leucodermic area from chronic irritations (Figures and ). She received antimonilia drug (Fluconazole).\nSpinal anastasia with sedations was used. The area was infiltrated with injection of adrenalin in concentration of 1 : 10000. Separation of the adhesion and fusions was done, and bilateral vulvar flaps to reconstruct the defect of raw surface resulted. Randomized mucocutaneous flaps were dissected posteriorly to be advanced to reconstruct the raw surface after separation of adhesion. Urethral catheter was applied and lastly suturing of flaps using polyglactin (4/0) (Ethicon). She was instructed for standard perineal care, which included spreading the labia periodically and washing with water and antiseptic. The patient was discharged 48 hours after surgery with no complications and instructed to continue routine perineal hygiene at home.\nFive days later she was seen in followup. She had resumed normal activity and was pain-free. Examination revealed that her labia were completely healed (see Figures , and , )."
"A 25-year-old Turkish woman presented to the emergency department with bleeding from her left leg. She had been treated with leeches for varicose veins in her lower extremities about 24 hours prior to her admission. The leeches had stayed in place for three to four hours in the posterior region of her legs. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. There was no bleeding diathesis and she was not taking any medication. On physical examination, she was a healthy woman with no findings of distress. Her vital signs were normal. There was oozing bleeding from her left leg. Punctured skin and bleeding, dilated veins were detected (Figure ). There was no ecchymosis, swelling, or erythema. The bleeding was controlled by compression applied with sterile gauze, and our patient was subsequently discharged.\nAfter four hours, our patient was again admitted to our emergency department with recurrent bleeding. The wound was cleaned with antiseptic solution. On physical examination, there were dilated veins with bleeding. The bleeding was active. Her varicose veins were explored under local anesthesia. The veins punctured by leech bite were dissected by operation. They were ligated with 4/0 Vicril Rapide sutures (Figure ).\nAfter completing hemostasis, the skin was sutured with 3/0 prolene. Our patient was examined seven days after her operation. The wound was clear without any complication."
"Our patient was a 25-year-old previously healthy female at 36th week gestation presented to the hospital with 4 days of progressive dyspnea and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history was pertinent for gestational thrombocytopenia which resolved spontaneously but no history of epistaxis or family history of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome was noted. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic on ventilator support. Chest X-ray revealed right-sided pleural effusion which caused complete hemithorax opacification.\nPatient underwent emergent cesarean delivery due to unstable vital signs and frequent fetal decelerations. Due to persistent hypoxia and hypotension, patient was admitted to ICU with ventilator support. Physical exam was significant for decreased breath sounds on the right side, dull percussion note, and decreased vocal tactile fremitus but no evidence of cyanosis.\nVital signs were systolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of 40 mm Hg, pulse rate 142/min, pulse oximetry saturation 86% to 88% on 100% inspired oxygen, afebrile, and respiratory rate of 30/min. Patient was visibly diaphoretic using accessory muscles with sinus tachycardia noted on monitor.\nInitial labs revealed normal platelets, normal coagulation panel, and hemoglobin of 6.5 gm/dL. Critical care panel showed pH of 7.4, pCO2 of 50 mm hg, pAO2 60 mm hg, and saturation of 88%.\nA chest tube was placed which revealed a hemothorax. four liters of frank blood was removed with the chest tube placement which also resulted in normalization of the blood pressure and improved oxygenation on the monitor. Repeat chest X-ray showed continued opacification of the right lung, and the patient's hemoglobin continued to fall (). CT-chest with IV contrast showed a likely 1 cm area of active contrast extravasation along with compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe.\nPulmonary angiography confirmed an AVM with feeding branch of a basilar right pulmonary artery supplying aneurysmal AVM and dilated draining vein. Embolisation of the culprit vessel was performed ().\nRepeat chest X-ray showed continued opacification of the right lung and suspecting an organized blood clot thoracoscopic evacuation was performed."
"A 25-year-old Indian Muslim man reported to the Department of Periodontics, Teerthanker Mahaveer Dental College and Research Centre, Moradabad, with a chief complaint of bleeding gums and foul smell since 2 to 3 years. He was found to have localized aggressive periodontitis. On routine clinical and radiographic examination, supernumerary eumorphic fifth mandibular incisor was found. We could not differentiate the eumorphic fifth mandibular incisor from the remaining mandibular incisors, clinically or radiographically, neither was there any fusion between crowns and roots in lower incisors. The five mandibular incisors were separate and same in morphology [Figures –]. Apart from this, no other case of supernumerary teeth was detected either in the subject or in his family members.\nLocalized aggressive periodontitis was diagnosed by ≥5 mm pocket probing depth around all the four first molars with moderate vertical bone loss radiographically. In lower incisors, there was ≥5 mm attachment loss but due to recession, and pocket depth was ≥3 mm.\nIn lower jaw, third molar of right side was impacted, and impaction was mesioangular, whereas the third molar of left side was well erupted and in normal occlusion. Hematological examination consisting of total leukocyte count (TLC), differential leukocyte count (DLC), hemoglobin (Hb), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), clotting time (CT), bleeding time (BT) revealed no significant findings."
"A 25-year-old Greek Caucasian woman with a history of IVDU and chronic hepatitis C virus was admitted to our department because of a four-day history of fever (39.0°C) associated with left lower quadrant abdominal pain. She recalled an injection of heroin into her left groin seven days prior to her presentation to our hospital. At the time of presentation to our hospital, the patient's temperature was 39.1°C, her heart rate was 118 beats/minute, her respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, her blood pressure was 115/70 mmHg and her oxygen saturation was 97%. Her physical examination revealed sensitivity to palpation of the left quadrant abdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nHer laboratory work-up at the time of admission showed normochromic normocytic anemia with a hematocrit level of 31.3% and a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dl. Her white blood cell count was 15×109/l with a neutrophil count of 12.6×109/l. Her serum urea was 14 mg/dl, creatinine was 0.6 mg/dl, glucose was 67 mg/dl and lactate dehydrogenase was 387 U/l. Her C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were significantly elevated at 152 mg/dl and 110 mm/hour, respectively. Her liver function tests were as follows: total bilirubin, 2.24 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase, 26 U/l (normal, 40 U/l); alanine aminotransferase, 20 U/l (normal, 40 U/l); alkaline phosphatase, 482 U/l (normal, 280 U/l); and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 136 U/l (normal, 32 U/l). Moreover, her serology was negative for HIV and hepatitis B virus. The results of urinalysis, electrocardiography and chest X-ray were normal.\nComputed tomography (CT) of her abdomen (Figure , arrows) revealed multiple small abscesses in the left iliopsoas, and as a result the diagnosis of pyomyositis was established. Blood was drawn for multiple cultures, and treatment with IV antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam and vancomycin) was started. Serial blood and tissue cultures obtained after a CT-guided needle biopsy were negative, and the patient continued on the same antibiotic regimen. One week later follow-up CT disclosed bilateral dilation of the ureters and renal calyces, particularly on the right side. IV pyelography confirmed the above findings and also showed a significant displacement of the urinary bladder (Figure , arrows).\nThe patient maintained efficient diuresis and normal renal function. Thus, no surgical intervention was performed. She remained hospitalized for one month receiving IV antibiotic therapy, and the follow-up IV pyelography and CT scan were both negative for dilations. She was discharged in good health with normalization of her biochemical and hematological parameters."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with a complaint of an asymptomatic swelling in the right lower back teeth region since 1 year, which had gradually increased to the present size. His medical and family history was unremarkable and there was no history of trauma. On extraoral examination, facial asymmetry was apparent with a diffuse swelling involving the right side of the lower jaw, measuring approximately 3 × 1 cm. The swelling was firm and nontender. Intraoral examination revealed a diffuse swelling in relation to right lower second premolar, first, second and third molars with vestibular obliteration. There was expansion of buccal and lingual cortical bone. On aspiration, blood-tinged fluid was obtained and electrical pulp testing showed that the involved teeth were nonvital.\nMandibular occlusal radiograph showed expansion of the cortical plates [] and a panoramic radiograph revealed a large unilocular radiolucency present in the body of mandible, extending from the root of right second premolar to the retromolar region. There was thinning but no discontinuity of the lower border of the mandible and displacement of the mandibular canal toward the lower border of mandible and radicular resorption of involved teeth []. Axial computed tomographic examination was performed and revealed a well-circumscribed bony expansile cystic lesion measuring 6.1 × 2.5 × 4 cm in size, with the epicenter at ramus of mandible and extending into right half of body of mandible []. The involved teeth were removed and curettage of the lesion was performed under general anesthesia [] and the tissue was sent for histopathologic evaluation. The microscopic examination revealed numerous small and large vascular spaces lined by endothelial cells. Abundant pools of RBCs were seen. Hemosiderin pigment was seen at places along with giant cells, which was suggestive of ABC [Figure and .]\nA panoramic radiograph was taken after 1 year of follow-up, which revealed complete healing of the involved site with no evidence of recurrence []."
"A three-month-old Jordanian female baby was vaginally delivered at full-term to a 25-year-old mother on her second pregnancy, the first being successfully carried past 20 weeks (G2P1). The baby's parents were healthy and non-related. She presented with a history of ano-rectal malformation for further management. She underwent sigmoid loop colostomy after 24 hours of birth outside our hospital. General examination of the baby upon presentation showed a few external abnormal features such as a small head, low-set ears, corneal opacities in both eyes, and a high-arched palate in addition to signs of dehydration and being underweight. An abdominal examination revealed ulcerated inflamed skin in the left lower quadrant around a prolapsing loop colostomy, with fluid stool content. A perineal examination showed a single orifice, with urine coming through it. No anal or vaginal orifices were seen (Figure ), and the labio-scrotal folds were under-developed. Her work-up showed that she was suffering from atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), a delay in mental development, corneal opacities, and cloacal ano-rectal malformation.\nA micturating cysto-urethrogram confirmed the common channel of the deformity. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was normal. Skeletal survey and brain magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. A chromosomal analysis was carried out, involving 20 CTG-banded cells from two cultures, and five cells were karotyped and photographed, showing 46,XX,del(3)(q29) (Figure ).\nOur patient was treated for the colostomy complication and, at the age of nine months, she underwent full repair of the cloaca through posterior saggital ano-recto-vaginoplasty. Smooth post-operative recovery was achieved, and three months later the colostomy opening was closed. Her heart condition was stable over the three years of follow-up, the VSD and ASD reduced in size, her corneal opacities did not progress, and she remained under the supervision of our ophthalmologist. Her mental development continued to grow slowly, and she is now able to speak a few words and stand up without support."
"A 25-year-old man presented to casualty with sudden loss of vision and a central scotoma in his right eye (RE). Ocular and medical histories were unremarkable. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/20 in RE and 20/16 in left eye (LE). Biomicroscopic examination showed normal anterior segments. Fundus examination of RE revealed a greyish lesion at the level of the RPE affecting the fovea. There were no cells in the vitreous. The LE was normal. Five days after the onset of symptoms, VA in RE had dropped to 20/25, and the central scotoma had enlarged. Fundus examination revealed the lesion being enlarged, threatening the foveal centre (Fig. ). The FFA showed a foveal hypofluorescent lesion in the early and mid-phases becoming hyperfluorescent in the late recirculation times (Fig. ). OCT depicted as a hyper-reflective RPE lesion protruding into the inner/outer segment junction (Fig. ). Microperimetry probed a central scotoma with marked loss of retinal sensitivity extending far beyond the lesion margins (Fig. ). In view of the loss of VA, the lesion growth and the foveal location, a course of systemic prednisone, starting with a dose of 1 mg/kg/daily (80 mg), was prescribed. The prednisone was then waned by 20 mg weekly.\nFive days after initiation of therapy, VA in the RE had improved to 20/20. Microperimetry revealed mild recovery of foveal sensitivity (Fig. ), and OCT showed a reduction in retinal thickness with hyper-reflective choroidal lines reflecting photoreceptor disruption and RPE atrophy (Fig. ). Three months later, VA was 20/16 in both eyes. Microperimetry was within normal values (Fig. ), and OCT remained with the hyper-reflective RPE specks causing hyporeflective streaks in the choroid (Fig. ). At 2 years follow-up, VA and retinal sensitivity remained normal, but there was a depigmented RPE lesion with focal hyperplasia with a honeycomb appearance (Fig. )."
"A 25-year-old male was referred for hearing impairment and discharge on and off from left ear for a period of time. Family history is unremarkable and laboratory data is with normal limit. Pure tone audiometry evaluation was arranged and conductive hearing loss of left ear was identified. A mass noted in the left external auditory canal. High resolution computed tomography showed an approximately 0.8 × 0.6 cm soft tissue mass occupying within the left external ear canal near the opnening, without eroding canal wall. Tumor excision was performed and the resected tumor was submitted for pathological examination. The patient recovered uneventfully without evidence of recurrence nine months after operation."
"A healthy 25-year-old Caucasian woman was seen at our stomatology outpatient clinic with a three-week history of a lump on her hard palate, which was non-tender upon oral examination. Our patient reported the presence of a stabbing pain radiating to the region of the temporomandibular joint in the previous week. The patient was a dentist and made a self-diagnosis of an abscess.\nClinical examination revealed a submucosal nodule on the right side of her hard palate that measured almost 2.5 cm in its major diameter. The color of the mucosal surface was normal (Figure ) and a fluctuant area was detected in the posterior region upon palpation. Occlusal radiography revealed no abnormalities (Figure ). The first diagnostic hypothesis was malignant salivary gland tumor; most likely mucoepidermoid carcinoma considering the stabbing pain, duration of the lesion and palpation of a fluctuant area. An incisional biopsy was performed. Histological examination of the specimen revealed a mucosal fragment lined with parakeratinized stratified epithelium exhibiting mild hyperplasia. Several minor salivary gland lobules were found deep in the lamina propria, which were characterized by atrophic, sometimes broken acini, leakage of mucus, intraglandular ductal dilatation, and a moderate stromal mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. Some lobules were necrotic, although the lobular architecture was preserved. The lobules were permeated by ducts with squamous metaplasia. Leakage of eosinophilic amorphous material was observed, which was intermingled with an intense mixed inflammatory infiltrate containing foamy macrophages. No signs of malignancy were found. The diagnosis was necrotizing sialometaplasia (Figure ).\nSeven days after surgery, the biopsy wound showed normal healing. Ulceration was noted in the biopsy area after 14 days (Figure ). The lesion had healed spontaneously after 30 days, with the observation of clinical signs of involution of the nodule (Figure )."
"We found a cystic structure in a Caucasian 25-year-old woman incidentally during an ultrasound examination. Our primary clinical suspicions were that it was an ovarian cyst. She had no history of abdominal disease.\nThe lesion was localized in the right lower quadrant. In a control examination a few months later, the finding was described as an extraluminal cystic, septic structure underneath the cecum and in a lateral position in relation to the iliac vessels. For further differentiation, MRI was performed, which revealed a 4.5 cm cystic lesion in the cecal region (Figure ).\nThe patient's blood chemistry was unremarkable. The indication was for surgical resection because of the size of the cyst, but resection carried the risk of potential complications. However, surgical resection was the wish of the patient. Laparoscopic exploration showed contact of the cyst to the ascending colon (Figures and ). The whole cyst, including its base and an adjacent part of the colon, was resected (Figure ) using the Multifire Endo GIA™ 45 Stapler (Covidien Deutschland GmbH, Sugical, Gewerbepark 1, 93333 Neustadt/Donau, Germany). The staple line was subsequently oversewn manually.\nThe histopathological examination of the cyst showed a 3.5 cm × 2.7 cm fluid-filled cystic jelly structure with serous content (Figure ) and a smooth endothelial layer (Figure ). The mass was soft and green. Focally, aggregates of lymphocytes were found. The diagnosis of a lymphangiomatous cyst was made.\nThe patient's recovery was fast and uneventful. Peristaltic activity appeared on day 1 post-operatively, and the patient was discharged within two days after surgery. At her follow-up examination one year after surgery, the patient was symptom-free without recurrence."
"The fourth patient, a 25-year-old man, presented with a 20 cm long but non-inflamed appendix. This was fully contained and adhering to his inguinal sac wall, pulling the cecum up to the internal inguinal orifice. The patient underwent a mesh-plug hernia repair along with appendectomy."
"The patient was a 25-year-old, right-handed woman who presented two months after the sudden onset of lower extremity paresthesias and sensory loss that extended into the abdomen and lower chest and one episode of urinary urgency and subsequent incontinence. Her examination was notable for brisk lower extremity deep tendon reflexes but no other abnormalities. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed both cervical and midthoracic plaques consistent with demyelination. A subsequent brain MRI revealed five scattered, nonenhancing, white-matter lesions; including a large (approximately 5 mm in diameter) lesion involving the corpus callosum and two lesions perpendicular to the left lateral ventricle. Her B12 level, HTLV-1 antibodies, vitamin E level, RPR, ANA, and Lyme titre were all within normal limits She was started on glatiramer acetate following her clinically isolated syndrome of partial transverse myelitis and MRI findings confirming dissemination in space. Two and a half years after her initial presentation, she developed right hemiparesis that resolved over a few days following treatment with intravenous steroids. She had a subsequent similar episode of left hemiparesis and hemisensory deficit two months after that, confirming a diagnosis of clinically definite multiple sclerosis.\nOne year after her initial presentation, she developed a sudden onset of discomfort in her legs associated with an urge to move that was worse at night and impaired sleep. The symptom resolved while walking and had been present for only 3-4 days at the time of presentation. Her last menstrual period was two weeks prior to this presentation, and she was faithfully using an oral contraceptive. Her iron level was 108 mcg/dl, iron saturation was 28.6%, and ferritin was 94 ng/ml. A brain MRI did not reveal any new lesions. Her symptoms resolved a few days after a course of intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g daily for three days), and she had no recurrence over the next three years."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian female gravida 4 with a history of two cesarean sections at full term and one spontaneous abortion presented to our clinic with vaginal bleeding. Quantitative beta hCG was 159 mLU/mL. Baseline transvaginal ultrasound showed a well-defined uterus with small amount of fluid in the lower segment of the uterus at the cervical canal with no gestational sac. A repeat transvaginal ultrasound after one week confirmed a gestational sac at the very lower segment of the uterus essentially below the prior cesarean section scars and in the cervix. Fetal heart rate was 101 beats per minute and estimated gestational age was 6 weeks and one day based on the last menstrual period. Quantitative beta hCG was 3490 mLU/mL at this point. Ultrasound was repeated five days later and showed the gestational sac in the cervical canal with a fetal heart rate of 122 beats per minute () and quantitative beta hCG was 10694 mLU/mL. Speculum exam showed a copious amount of bleeding and clots and an enlarged and very tender closed cervix. Microscopic study of the vaginal blood did not show evidence of placenta or fetal tissue. Suction curettage of the gestational sac was performed four days later and the tissue was sent to pathology which confirmed immature placenta and decidual tissue. Beta hCG was 15437 mLU/mL on the day of procedure and 187 mLU/mL and 2 mLU/mL 2 weeks and 2 months after the procedure, respectively. Bleeding stopped completely and the patient resumed her normal periods. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this case."
"A 25-year-old athletic-body gentleman presented with significant pain in both shoulders and inability to do daily activities for 5 days after electrical shock. Immediately after electricity-induced trauma, he had been transferred to a major trauma center. Primary cares had been given. He had been visited by an emergency medicine physician. Routine anteroposterior radiograph of the shoulders () was misinterpreted. Then, he had been discharged with analgesic and arm sling. Five days later, he referred to the senior author with pain and restriction of bilateral shoulder movements. In physical exam, posterior positions of the humeral heads were not palpable due to his muscular body. The patient had fixed both upper limbs in adduction and internal rotation. Passive and active external rotation was blocked and very painful. Moreover, the patient did not permit passive abduction and forward flexion of more than 45 degrees. Neurovascular functions of both sides were normal. Bilateral shoulder posterior dislocation was suspected and CT scan was requested (). It showed bilateral posterior dislocation associated with articular surface defect of 50% in the right side and 30% in the left. He underwent closed reduction under general anesthesia after taking consent. Left side reduction was stable but the right was unstable in internal rotation. Bilateral shoulder spica cast was applied in 20 degrees of abduction and 15 degrees of external rotation.\nAfter six weeks, the cast was discarded. Stability of joints was well. Rehabilitation program including active and passive range of motion and deltoid and rotator cuff strengthening exercises were begun. As he was a professional athlete in weight lifting, he continued exercises for one year. After one-year follow-up, he had bilateral stable joint with full range of motion without any history of dislocation. CT scan () showed bilateral small defect in anteromedial part of the humeral heads which is more in the left side."
"A 25 year-old Caucasian woman presented with a four-day history of acute onset of blurred vision in both eyes. She reported a viral upper respiratory tract infection for seven to 10 days, for which she had taken two Excedrin® Migraine (acetaminophen 250 mg, aspirin 250 mg and caffeine 65 mg) tablets. She used Midrin (acetaminophen 325 mg, dichloralphenazone 100 mg, isometheptene mucate 65 mg) as needed for her headaches concurrently. Additionally, she smoked half-pack cigarettes and consumed four to five 12-ounce cans of a caffeinated drink, Mountain Dew (caffeine 54 mg/can) per day.\nHer uncorrected Snellen visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes and Amsler testing revealed bitemporal paracentral scotomas. She correctly identified 10 and nine out of 14 Ishihara color plates, in her right and left eye, respectively. No afferent pupillary defect was noted and the anterior segment was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed bilateral hyperpigmentary changes in the papillomacular bundle (Figure ). Fundus autofluorescence revealed a normal autofluorescence pattern. IR imaging disclosed classic wedge-shaped lesions with their apices oriented towards the fovea. SD-OCT exhibited changes at the inner segment-outer segment (IS-OS) junction, with a thickened OPL overlying these areas (Figures ). Humphrey visual field (HVF) 30-2 demonstrated bilateral paracentral scotomas. Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography did not demonstrate any perfusion defects or any other abnormality.\nFive months after initial presentation, her color vision improved to 14 of 14 Ishihara color plates correctly identified in each eye. Repeat HVF testing demonstrated interval improvement in the scotomas, more in her right eye than left. Similarly, SD-OCT showed a corresponding small improvement at the IS-OS junction in her right eye (Figure and ) and no change in her left eye (Figure and ). Microperimetry using an MP-1 (Nidek, Japan) demonstrated focal elevation in threshold correlating with the wedge-shaped defects in both her eyes (Figure and )."
"A previously healthy 25-year-old-Asian woman was referred for evaluation of an enlarging, painless, subcutaneous mass located intergluteal fold. It was clinically diagnosed as a pilonidal cyst by previous examiner. She could remember that a mass had been present in this region for 2 years. During the 2-year period the mass had slowly increased in size from less than 0.5 cm to over 2.5 cm in diameter. During the past few months, the mass had become tender and sometimes making it uncomfortable to sit down. There was no history of urinary or faecal problems. Physical examination revealed a 2 × 3 cm sized, solid, mildly tender, mobile mass over the coccyx. It was well circumscribed proximally but not in distally on palpation. Neurological examination was normal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 6 ×3 cm well-circumscribed subcutaneous mass located over the coccyx. This tumor was comprised of two ovoid mass and there was no direct invasion to the coccyx (). Ultrasonography (USG)-guided needle biopsy was performed and microscopic examination showed a myxopapillary ependymoma. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the thorax and abdomen demonstrated no evidence of lung or liver metastases. Isotope bone scanning revealed no evidence of skeletal metastases.\nThe mass was completely excised. Intraoperatively, the lesion was seen near the tip of the coccyx and well-circumscribed. It was composed of two ovoid but contiguous masses, the larger 3.0 × 2.5 × 1.5 cm, and the smaller 1.2 ×1.0 ×0.8 cm (). The histology of the specimens again confirmed a myxopapillary ependymoma (). Her postoperative course was uneventful and no adjuvant therapy was offered.\nDuring 2 years of follow-up no local recurrence or metastasis were detected, with chest radiography and abdomino-pelvic MRI ()."
"A 25-year-old male was admitted to our emergency department complaining of severe chest pain 2 h after its onset. The pain radiated to the ulnar aspect of the patient's left arm, neck, and jaw. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated an ST-segment elevation of 7 mm in leads II, III, and aVF, consistent with an inferior wall AMI (Figure ). A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed a non-dilated left ventricle with inferior hypokinesia, confirming a recent myocardial infarction. On physical examination, the patient was conscious but extremely anxious. His blood pressure was 90/55 mmHg, pulse rate 62 beats/min, and respiratory rate 25 breaths/min. The patient had no cardiac risk factors for coronary artery disease, no history of recent emotional or physical stress, and had not ingested any illicit substances.\nThe patient began taking oral cayenne pepper pills for slimming, once a day, 5 days before presenting to the hospital. The patient's cardiac enzyme levels on admission were normal, but subsequently showed a crescendo-decrescendo pattern with a peak troponin T value of 4.6 ng/ml (normal < 0.01 ng/ml). The patient was diagnosed with an inferior AMI, and appropriate treatment was instituted, including controlled intravenous fluids with normal saline, aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin, low-dose morphine, and unfractionated heparin. The patient's pain and ECG changes disappeared after the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. An urgent diagnostic coronary angiogram within 3 h of the onset of chest pain revealed normal right and left coronary artery systems (Figure ). Since the coronary arteries were normal, oral diltiazem (60 mg) three times daily was added to his therapy. One month later, the patient had experienced no angina attacks, and echocardiography showed mild hypokinesia of the inferior wall."
"A 2.5 kg infant was born at 38 weeks gestation after lower abdominal caesarian section (L.A.C.S.) of 25 years old woman having breech presentation in our hospital. The female child showed peripheral cyanosis as evident from the .\nThe mother having B positive blood group, was tested positive for TORCH-test. TORCH, as an acronym, stands for Toxoplasmosis, Other [T. pallidum, Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Parvovirus B19], Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). She was positive for toxoplasmosis caused by the protozoan, Toxoplasma gondiiand Cytomegalovirus (CMV). She had three abortions prior to this pregnancy. The infant is infected transplacentally after the parasites invade the placenta.The digital skiagram chest AP view of the baby showed both lung fields and CP angle to be normal, which was carried out on the third day after birth.\nThe baby's blood report on sixth day after birth showed Serum Bilirubin (total) to be 4.6 mg/dl, S. Bilirubin Direct 1.5 mg/dl and S. Bilirubin Indirect 3.1 mg/dl, whereas random sugar level was found to be 87.8 mg/dl which was within normal range. Blood analysis carried with Radiometer ABL77 Series showed the abnormalities regarding Hematocrit: 63% (36 - 48%); Electrolytes: K+ 5.5 mM/L (3.4 - 4.5 mM/L), Cl- 109 mM/L (98 106 mM/L); Blood Gas at 37oC: pCO2 54 mmHg (32 - 45 mmHg), pO2 23 mmHg (83 - 108 mmHg) and pH 7.23 (7.35 - 7.45). Other detailed blood report of the baby was nearly normal. But, interestingly, the methemoglobin was found significantly high: 7.2% whereas the normal range in children < 1 year is up to 1.5% of the total hemoglobin.\nIn the present case, doppler echocardiography was employed, which is a procedure using ultrasound technology to examine the heart. An echocardiogram uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the heart while the use of doppler technology allows determination of the speed and direction of blood flow by utilizing the doppler effect. Doppler echocardiography showed tetralogy of Fallot, and the present case represents the Pentalogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. The babys heart anomalies were ASD (Atrial Septal Defect - 6 mm RT to LT Shunt), VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect - bidirectional shunt), PDA (Patent Ductus Arteriosus - filling both the pulmonary arteries), and Overriding of Aorta with pulmonary atresia."
"A 25-year-old primigravida was referred to our clinic at 23 weeks of gestation due to fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The family history was unremarkable and first-trimester screening test for chromosomal aneuploidies was normal. Ultrasound examination showed fetal measurements (BPD, HC, AC, FL) below the 5th centile, consistent with severe symmetrical IUGR. Umbilical artery Doppler flow velocimetry exhibited reverse end-diastolic flow and pulsatility index (PI) was 1.83 (>95th centile); in addition, uterine artery PI were bilaterally increased (>95th centile) measuring 2.25 and 1.78 respectively and notches were present as well. No fetal malformation was present. As the amniotic fluid volume was reduced (AFI < 5), the ultrasound imaging of fetal facial anomalies was hampered. Upon abnormal ultrasound findings, an amniocentesis was performed and karyotype analysis led to the diagnosis of WHS which was further confirmed by a-CGH and FISH. After genetic counseling, termination of pregnancy was performed at parents' request at 25 weeks of gestation. A male neonate was delivered vaginally after medical induction with prostaglandins. Detailed pathological examination of the proband was denied by the parents."
"A 25-year-old female patient referred to the Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology at SGT Dental College, Hospital and Research Institute, Gurgaon with a chief complaint of sensitivity in her upper front teeth. On examination it was seen that the patient had generalized recession particularly in relation to the maxillary anterior teeth from the left to the right maxillary canines (). It was diagnosed to be Miller's class I recession with no interdental dental bone loss (). The clinical attachment loss was the most severe on both the canines being 4 and 5 mm on right and left maxillary canines, respectively. The soft tissue biotype was examined both visually and by seeing for transparency of a probe inserted through the gingival margin []. It was adjudged to be a thin tissue biotype.\nThorough scaling and root planning was done for the patient, and she was put on a comprehensive oral hygiene maintenance program. On the day of the surgery, lignocaine 2% was used to anaesthetize the maxillary anterior teeth and the palate bilaterally. Sparing the interdental papilla a partial thickness flap was raised from the left maxillary canine to the right maxillary canine (). Some undermining of the tissue was done distal to both maxillary canines, to allow movement of the flap and aid in placement of the subepithelial connective tissue graft.\nDue to the amount of connective tissue required to cover the defect, it was preplanned to take the graft bilaterally from the palate. Once the graft was procured, palatal sutures were placed. The connective tissue graft was then trimmed to fit the defect. Following that it was placed to cover the recession defects and sutured in place with Vicryl 4-0 sutures. A periodontal dressing was then placed over the surgical site to aid in uneventful healing.\nSutures were removed at 10 days postoperatively (), and the patient was examined every week for the first one month and every month for the following year. Almost complete root coverage has been achieved in all the teeth which appears to be stable at the end of one year (). We were also successfully able to modify the soft tissue biotype into a relatively thicker, more durable one."
"A 25-year-old G0 woman with no significant past medical history or physical findings other than polycystic ovaries on ultrasound enrolled in our Ooctye Donor Program. Downregulation was achieved using OCPs and depot leuprolide acetate 3.75 intramuscularly on day 21. Ovarian stimulation was initiated with 225 IU of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) for 5 days. This dose was tapered as a result of the patient's ovarian response, measured by ultrasound and estradiol levels. She received a total of 1975 IU of hMG over 9 days and 500 μg of r-hCG when two follicles reached a 17 mm diameter; her peak estradiol level was 3,731 pmol/L. A total of 44 oocytes were retrieved.\nThe patient initially presented 2 days after oocyte retrieval with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and a 2-pound weight gain. She denied nausea, vomiting, or abdominal distention. She was afebrile but tachycardic. Her lungs were clear on auscultation, abdomen was slightly distended with mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Ultrasound evaluation demonstrated no evidence of intraperitoneal fluid, and ovaries were enlarged bilaterally (left: 56 × 89 mm; right: 48 × 81 mm) consistent with moderate hyperstimulation. She had normal electrolytes and renal function, hematocrit was 0.44%; she was initially managed as an outpatient with oral hydration and modified activity. Her symptoms progressed such that by POD #12, she presented with a 5-pound weight gain and nonproductive cough. Her pulse was 118 bpm and saturating 97% on room air. On physical examination, breath sounds were absent in ~66% of the posterior right lung field. Her abdomen remained slightly distended, and on ultrasound, there was still no evidence of intraperitoneal fluid. A chest X-ray (CXR) confirmed a large right pleural effusion (). Spiral CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and confirmed a minimal amount of abdominal ascites. Thoracentesis was performed; 2600 cc clear yellow fluid was initially suctioned off with a total of 2900 cc over 48 hours. Total fluid protein was 37 g/L, which is consistent with exudates. Pleural fluid culture was negative. She was placed on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and sequential compression devices (SCDs) for DVT prophylaxis.\nDuring her 2-day hospital admission, her dyspnea and nonproductive cough resolved. On day of discharge her CXR showed resolution of the pleural effusion, and, subsequently, the chest tube was removed without complications. She returned to our office 3 days after hospital discharge with a 9-pound weight loss and complete resolution of symptoms. The patient was followed closely as an outpatient with serial chest X-rays; she fully recovered without further sequelae."
"A 25-year-old primigravida was referred to us at 38 weeks for management of cardiac disease complicating pregnancy. Incidentally, during antenatal ultrasound, an intra-abdominal anechoic cyst, just above the level of kidneys, measuring 7 × 8 cm was noted (). Bladder was visualized separately. Placenta was situated in the upper segment and amniotic fluid index was normal. Intra-abdominal organs, heart, and diaphragm were not displaced. Estimated fetal weight was 2.3 kg suggesting mild IUGR. Provisional diagnosis of either mesenteric, ovarian, or duplication cyst was considered. She had mitral valve prolapse with NYHA class I. Since cyst was neither compressing other organs nor distending abdomen, vaginal delivery was planned. However, cesarean delivery was done for fetal distress. A female baby of 2.15 kg, with APGAR 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively, was delivered. Postnatal examination of the baby revealed a palpable cystic mass of 10 × 8 cm in the right hypochondrium. No other congenital abnormalities were noted. Baby tolerated feeds well. Ultrasound was suggestive of an anechoic cyst in close relation to the left lobe of liver. Conservative management was advised by pediatric surgeon. Baby was on regular followup.\nHowever, laparotomy was performed at 2 months for persistence of cyst. Liver function, renal function tests, and electrolytes were preoperatively normal. At laparotomy, a cystic lesion arising from 5th segment of liver was noted and the same was excised (). Histopathology revealed that the cyst was devoid of lining epithelium and was lined by hyalinized fibrous tissue suggestive of mesenchymal hamartoma of liver ().\nPostoperative period was uneventful. After 2 months of surgery, a small cystic lesion (4 × 1 cm) was seen arising from the inferior part of right lobe of liver. It was decided to followup, the cyst. At the end of 2 months of postoperative follow up the cystic lesion reduced in size to 5 mm and baby was asymptomatic with good catch up growth."
"A 25-years-old primigravida at 38 weeks of gestation reported to our hospital with severe intermittent and colicky abdominal pain of one-day duration. It started acutely but gradually increased in intensity involving all the abdomen. On examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable and afebrile. The uterus was term size and tender on palpation. A large mass of 10 × 10 cms was palpated on its right upper part. On vaginal examination os was 1 cm dilated and 30% effaced. Nonstress test (NST) was reactive on admission. Hemogram was normal and ultrasonography (USG) showed a single live intrauterine fetus with cephalic presentation with an intramural fibroid 10 × 10 cms on the right fundal region. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the findings but torsion was not suspected since the classical sign on MRI was not seen as the films were not taken at the level of the vagina. Carneous degeneration of the fibroid or abruption placentae was suspected. As pain increased and fetal bradycardia of 90 bpm was there, patient underwent emergency cesarean under spinal anaesthesia. Abdomen was opened by pfannenstiel incision. On entering the abdominal cavity the left round ligament, ovary, and fallopian tubes were rotated to right and with manipulation that came into the view (). As it was not possible to perform detorsion of the gravid uterus by exteriorization by pfannenstiel incision it was converted to vertical incision. Uterus was derotated by exteriorizing the myoma and the uterus out of the abdominal cavity. Once the torsion was corrected, lower segment cesarean was carried out. Alive female baby of 3 kgs weight was delivered. Uterus was closed in 2 layers and put back into abdomen (). Abdomen was closed. Patient recovered well and was discharged on 5th postoperation day."
"A 25-year-old woman with 17 weeks of gestation (G3P2) presented with progressive dysphagia, epigastric discomfort, persistent postprandial vomiting, and weight loss for one month. Initial investigations were within normal limits. Upper GI endoscopy showed thickened nodular friable mucosa at cardia of stomach extending into the posterior wall (). Multiple deep biopsies from gastric cardia showed normal mucosal glands with expansion of lamina propria by infiltrates of atypical cells, intermixed with granulocytic precursor cells (). Immunohistochemistry panel showed that the cells were negative for CD20, CD5, CD3, CD10, and cytokeratin markers, with intense positivity for immature myeloid markers (myeloperoxidase, CD34, and CD117) (), consistent with granulocytic sarcoma of the stomach. A week later she developed fever with WBC count of 34,800 cells per cu mm. A bone marrow biopsy () and flow cytometry analysis showed features consistent with acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M4) with blast count of 77%. Pregnancy was terminated."
"A 25-year-old male was diagnosed in 2004 as a femur osteosarcoma with no evidence of distance metastases. Initial treatment was by resection of the primary tumour with adjuvant chemotherapy.\nThereafter, he remained well until April 2010 when he presented with a 6-week history of painless haematuria and painful masse in the lumbar region. Abdominal CT scan revealed a renal masse (). This entity has not been previously described and the initial suspicion was that the patient had developed a further primary tumour. An ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastases. Chest computer scan showed pleural metastases ().\nPreoperative chemotherapy based on API regimen (adriablastin 60 mg/m2 D1, ifosfamide 1,8 g/m2 D1–D5, mesna 1,8 g/m2 D1–D5, cisplatin 60 mg/m2 D2) is started. A thoracoabdominal computer tomography scan after the 3 cycles of chemotherapy demonstrated that the lesions enlarged rapidly, a second regimen of chemotherapy based on cisplatin and etoposide was programmed."
"A 25-year-old female presented with colicky epigastric pain and nausea for three months, associated in the last month with weight loss and rectal bleeding.\nOn examination, she looked relatively well; her blood pressure was 104/60 mmHg, pulse 68/minute, respiration rate 20/minute, and temperature 37°C. Abdominal examination revealed a 5 × 8 cm firm, ill-defined mass in the left side of the epigastrium.\nHer laboratory works showed leucocytosis (12.8 × 109/μL, reference range 4–11 × 109) and apart from low albumin (21 gm/dL, reference range 34–48), her liver functions, renal values, and electrolytes were normal.\nUltrasound/computerized axial tomography scan showed a large mass in the left half of the transverse colon with mural thickening and irregular narrowing of the lumen. Multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were also seen. Barium enema showed a long irregular stricture of the distal transverse colon ().\nColonoscopy revealed an incomplete stricture of the middle and distal transverse colon with mucosal ulceration. Biopsies were taken and histopathology showed chronic active colitis with extensive ulcerations.\nAs the clinical picture was so much suggestive of colon cancer, the patient was subjected to laparotomy where a firm mass was found in the left half of the transverse colon, to which a jejunal loop was adherent. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were also found in the root of the mesentery. Subtotal colectomy with excision of the adherent 45 cm jejunal loop was performed and bowel continuity restored with ileosigmoid colostomy ().\nHistopathology of the resected specimen showed granulomatous reaction with areas of necrosis and acute suppurative inflammation. Broad, thin-walled, occasionally septated hyphae, surrounded by dense eosinophilic reaction (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon) were seen, which suggested the diagnosis of basidiobolomycosis (). Oral itraconazole, in a daily dose of 200 mg, was started. In her follow-up outpatient visits, the patient remained well, her investigations, including liver and renal function tests, were normal, and she is still under itraconazole treatment."
"A 25-year-old G2P1L1 with 25 weeks of pregnancy was referred to the emergency ward of our hospital at midnight from a peripheral rural health centre with a diagnosis of rupture uterus. Our hospital is a referral hospital attached to a government medical college which mainly caters to rural population. The lady had a previous uneventful vaginal delivery of a 2.5 kg baby 3 years back. This was her second pregnancy. She had antenatal checkups at a rural primary health centre. She went for an ultrasound examination at 25 weeks of gestation due to pain abdomen and absent fetal movements. The ultrasound examination done at the peripheral centre showed an intrauterine fetal demise of 24 weeks. In view of the fetal demise, the lady was induced with misoprostol for expulsion of the fetus. By twelve hours after induction she developed hypotension, tachycardia, and hypovolemic shock. In view of these features, a diagnosis of rupture uterus was made and the patient was referred to our hospital.\nOn examination, the lady was in hypovolemic shock with severe pallor and rapid feeble pulse. Her blood pressure was not recordable. The abdomen was tense and distended and the uterine size was not made out. Pelvic examination revealed fullness in the fornices with cervical movement tenderness. There was no vaginal bleeding. As the patient was in shock, she was taken for immediate laparotomy after resuscitation. Her hemoglobin was 3 gm% at the time of laparotomy.\nAt laparotomy, there was a rupture of right rudimentary noncommunicating horn of a unicornuate uterus () with the fetus and intact sac lying free in the peritoneal cavity with a hemoperitoneum of about three litres (). The fetus weighed about 600 grams (). The rudimentary horn was excised. After achieving hemostasis, abdomen was closed in layers after keeping a drain. The lady was transfused with 5 units of blood. Her postoperative recovery was good. She was later investigated for urinary tract anomalies which were found to be absent. She was discharged from the hospital on the eighth postoperative day."
"In this paper we describe the case of a 25-year-old woman with 38 weeks of gestation and a symptomatic tumor of the lower abdominal wall. We supposed the tumor to be a scar endometriosis as the patient had a previous caesarian section and the tumor was located 2 cm cranial to the scar. Therefore, a preoperative diagnostic cytology has not been performed. The presurgical examination showed a dense and painful mass with a diameter of 3-4 cm. Ultrasound revealed a subfascial, intramuscular localization. The tumor did not disturb the uterus and the pregnancy. As a caesarian section has been planned, we decided to resect the tumor within the surgery. After successful child delivery and closure of the uterine tissue and the peritoneum, we found a dense, incompressible, grey tumor in the right rectus sheath with a local infiltration of the rectus muscle. A local complete resection with a macroscopically tumor-free margin was performed. The tumor size of not more than 3 cm allowed the resection without any functional limitations. A mesh reconstruction was not necessary. Surprisingly, an aggressive musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis was found in the histologic examination. The patient recovered without any complications or functional defects. We recommended clinical and sonographic controls of the tumor location. Since 2 years after surgical intervention, the patient is recurrence-free."
"A twenty-five-year-old second gravida at 36 weeks of gestation was referred to our institution as a case of encephalocele with preeclampsia complicating pregnancy, for further management. The patient had regular antenatal visits and was diagnosed to have preeclampsia at 32 weeks of gestation. She was not on any medication. A target scan done at 19 weeks was said to be normal. On examination, her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. Systemic examination was normal. Obstetric examination revealed a single live fetus corresponding to thirty-six weeks in breech presentation. On ultrasound examination (Toshiba Nemio 10, curvilinear, 5 MHz probe), there was a fetus corresponding to 36 weeks in breech presentation with an amniotic fluid index of 14. There were two echogenic masses of 4 cm × 5 cm and 3 cm × 4 cm, arising from the placenta in close proximity with the occiput of the fetus (). One was cystic, and the other showed lobulation/septation. As there was no defect in the skull, encephalocele was considered to be less likely. Their attachment to other structures could not be traced. Gross fetal intracranial anatomy was normal. On Doppler ultrasound examination, there was minimal vascularity on the surface of the mass. Although magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) is the investigation of choice when an encephalocele is suspected, this investigation could not be done due to patients financial constraints. At thirty-eight weeks of gestation, the patient was posted for cesarean section for breech presentation, and a live male baby of 2.8 kg was delivered. There were no gross external deformities or anomalies in the neonate. The placenta measured 15 cm × 12 cm × 4 cm and weighed 250 grams. Maternal and fetal surfaces of the placenta were unremarkable. There were two masses attached to the membranes measuring 5.5 cm × 5 cm and 4 cm × 3 cm, respectively (). The first mass appeared lobulated. The second mass appeared cystic. Histopathological examination of the placenta was unremarkable. Histopathological examination of the masses showed lining of epidermis with attached adnexa of varying maturity. There were lobules of adipose tissue, stromal myxoid changes and islands of osteoid, and cartilage and smooth muscles tissues. The above findings were suggestive of benign teratoma of the placenta. The patient had uneventful postoperative period and was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. Neonate also did not have any problems."
"A 25-year-old pregnant lady was referred to our antenatal clinic at 24 weeks of gestation for investigations. She had a history of focal seizure, carpopedal spasm, and lip smacking movement since 6 years of age, for which she did not seek any medical advice. This was her second pregnancy which she had conceived spontaneously. Previously she had spontaneous abortion in first trimester. So far she had been supervised at a primary health centre and was apparently uncomplicated. There was no seizure activity during this pregnancy. She achieved menarche at 14 years of age, and her menstrual cycles were regular with scanty flow. At the age of 16 years, she had recurrent seizures for which she was prescribed oral phenytoin with some relief in symptoms. She stopped medication after 3 years without medical consultation.\nHer general physical examination revealed height of 145 cm (<3rd centile), round facies, and short right 4th metacarpal. Further detailed examination showed signs of latent tetany in the form of positive Chvostek's sign and Trousseau's sign. Abdominal examination revealed uterus of approximately 24 weeks of gestation. Blood investigation showed low serum calcium (7.8 mg/dL) with high serum phosphate (5.8 mg/dL). The blood parathormone (PTH) level was raised (196 pg/mL) together with high alkaline phosphatase (200 U/L) and high 25(OH) vitamin D (29.77) level. The blood thyroxin level was below normal range and was associated with high thyroid stimulating hormone level. EEG revealed generalized epileptiform discharge. Computerized tomographic examination of brain showed multiple calcifications in bilateral globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, thalamus, frontal region, parietal lobes, and cerebellar hemispheres. Ultrasonographic parameters for fetal growth were found adequate. She was diagnosed with pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a and prescribed oral calcium (2.5 gm/day) and active vitamin D (1 μg/day) together with levothyroxine 125 μg daily in empty stomach. She had spontaneous onset of labor at 40 weeks of gestation. Her serum calcium was found very low (1.52 mg/dL) but without any seizures or tetany. She was managed with calcium infusion. Augmentation of labour with oxytocin failed to progress, and emergency cesarean section was done under regional anesthesia for nonprogress of labour. She delivered a healthy baby with a birth weight of 3.2 kg with good Apgar score. Her intraoperative and postoperative course was uneventful. She was discharged in satisfactory condition on fourth postpartum day."
"A 25-year-old man suffering from severe right knee pain presented at our institution. He had received steroid-pulse therapy several times for nephrotic syndrome and was subsequently diagnosed with steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the lateral femoral condyle. The preoperative X-ray and MRI showed an osteochondral defect of the lateral femoral condyle (Figure A-C). Arthroscopic findings showed his cartilage defect was classified as International Cartilage Repair Society Grade IV lesion. Osteochondral autograft transplantation was performed using the Arthrex osteochondral autograft transfer system (Arthrex, Naples, Fla.). Bone plugs 9 mm in diameter and 15 mm in depth were removed from the lesion (recipient site). Then two osteochondral plugs 1.0 mm oversized in diameter and of the same length were harvested from the lateral patello-femoral joint surface of the ipsilateral knee and transplanted into the recipient site measuring 20 × 10 mm using the press-fit technique (Figure A-B). Postoperatively, the patient received continuous passive motion (CPM), but remained non-weight bearing for 4 weeks. Quadriceps and hamstring strengthening exercises were encouraged. The patient had to keep taking steroid after the operation in order to control primary disease. Postoperatively, no further clinical symptoms occurred after surgery and his Lysholm score had improved from 67 to 100 four year after surgery. X-rays and MRIs one year after surgery showed the restoration of the articular cartilage surface and good engraftment of the graft (Figure C-E). We did not find any abnormality in the donor site condition."
"A 25-year-old man presented with recurrent right epistaxis. Nasal endoscopy revealed a red, easily bleeding mass that filled the posterior part of the right nasal cavity. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed strongly enhanced tumor in the right nasal cavity with the extension to the PPF. The tumor also extended to the sphenoid sinus with bone erosion (). The tumor was considered as JNA, Radkowski stage IIA [], without performing preoperative biopsy due to the risk of bleeding. The angiography showed that the feeder into the tumor was internal maxillary artery (IMA) and the sphenopalatine artery (SPA).\nEndoscopic sinus surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Firstly, submucous inferior turbinoplasty (SIT) was performed. Vertical incision was made along the anterior margin of the inferior turbinate to expose the turbinate bone. The covering mucosa was elevated from the bone, and the inferior turbinate bone was removed with preserving the mucosa. Mucosal elevation was continued to expose the uncinate process. The inferior half of the uncinate process together with the horizontal portion of the inferior turbinate bone was then removed. SIT provided improved visualization and wide working space in the posterior part of the nasal cavity (Figures and ). The inferior turbinate mucosa was preserved throughout the surgery without swinging the lateral wall mucosa into the nasal cavity. Mucosal elevation was then continued posteriorly, and SPA, the feeder to the tumor was identified at the sphenopalatine foramen. Maxillary sinus was opened, and the mucosa was elevated from the posterior wall of the sinus. The posterior wall bone of maxillary sinus was then removed, and the PPF was widely exposed endoscopically (Figures and ). IMA was identified in the PPF and was ligated with a hemoclip, and IMA and SPA were cut with the Harmonic Scalpel (Figures and ). The tumor in the PPF was pushed into the nasal cavity. These procedures were all performed via submucous turbinate tunnel and were able to archive to manage the feeding artery safely without touching the easily bleeding tumor. Then, the tumor was resected transnasally without ethmoidectomy and was successfully removed in en bloc from the nasal cavity (Figures and ).\nNo nasal packing was needed, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of JNA. No recurrences were observed at the 2-year follow-up examination. The anatomical structure of the nasal cavity and the physiological function of the nose could be preserved by this surgical technique."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our emergency department with a three-day history of abdominal pain, distension and absolute constipation with vomiting. There was no significant medical or surgical history. She took no regular medications, and was a non-smoker and non-drinker. Bedside observations were normal. A physical examination revealed a distended tympanic abdomen with tenderness across the lower abdomen but no signs of peritonism. A urine dipstick test was unremarkable and blood tests showed a raised white blood cell count (14.4 ×109 cells/L) and C-reactive protein (35mg/L). Urea and electrolytes, hemoglobin and liver function tests were all normal.\nRadiographs of the abdomen (Figure ) and chest (Figure ) showed gross dilatation of the right side of the colon with Chilaiditi’s sign. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed massive dilatation of the caecum, which measured greater than 14 cm in diameter (Figures , , and ). The distal colon was collapsed with a transition point in the mid abdomen suggestive of a volvulus or band.\nA nasogastric tube was inserted, intravenous fluid resuscitation commenced and our patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy. Intra-operatively, the bowel was found to be significantly dilated from the caecum to the distal transverse colon and the distal small bowel was mildly dilated, giving the impression of decompression through an incompetent ileocaecal valve. There was a volvulus of the transverse colon in the right upper quadrant. The transverse mesocolon appeared to take origin from the right upper quadrant as opposed to the usual location as an extension of the peritoneum from the posterior abdominal wall centrally. There was no evidence of colonic ischemia or serosal injury.\nThe large bowel was decompressed with a 14 gauge needle allowing the tightly held bowel to be manipulated more easily. The large bowel was fully unraveled and the volvulus corrected then decompressed distally into the descending colon. The greater omentum on the transverse colon was then fixed at both the hepatic and splenic flexures by creating pouches in the lateral anterior abdominal walls, and fixing the omentum within this with polydioxanone sutures (PDS). The central portion of the omentum was purposefully caught in the mass closure of the wound to ensure additional central fixation.\nPost-operatively our patient made a good recovery. By day five she was tolerating a full diet and was discharged six days post-operatively. Despite a superficial wound infection at two weeks, she made a full recovery with no complications noted at her three month and six month follow-up."
"A 25-year-old man presented with complaints of vague epigastric pain and vomiting of one-year duration. Radiological investigations revealed diffuse wall thickening along the lesser curvature with multiple enlarged lymph nodes in peripancreatic, paraaortic, and mesenteric group. Upper GI endoscopy revealed thickening of entire stomach especially lesser curvature. Rest of the routine blood investigation was within normal limits. Biopsy obtained from the stomach showed diffuse infiltration of mucosa and submucosa by neoplastic monotonous medium-sized cells with pale nuclei having occasional prominent nucleoli and brisk mitotic activity. Thus suspecting lymphoid cell morphology and a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the stomach were given to be confirmed by immunohistochemistry.\nSubsequently patient came back within a week with signs and symptoms of acute intestinal obstruction for which an emergency laparotomy was done and a segment of thickened ileum which had led to ileo-ileal intussusception was resected to relieve the obstruction. Grossly, a 4 cm long segment of ileum was received which showed mucosal thickening of 1.5 cm, and cut surface of the same showed diffuse white appearance.\nHistology from the thickened ileum showed similar neoplastic monotonous cells of suspected lymphoid morphology as observed in the stomach (). Considering clinico-pathological findings, a diagnosis of ileal involvement by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was given. Immunohistochemistry performed on both stomach and ileum showed diffuse and strong positivity for CD34, MPO Ckit, MiB1 being 70% and negativity for CD3, CD20, and CD10 (Figures and ), thus making a diagnosis of extramedullary myeloid tumour or involvement by AML.\nSubsequently, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy done showed a hypercellular marrow containing almost 85%–90% cells of blast morphology, thus confirming marrow involvement by acute leukemia (). Flow cytometry results showed CD34 98%, HLA-DR 98%, CD13 96%, CD33 99%, CD11 97% with negativity for CD10 and CD22 in 71% cells gated, thus confirming acute myeloid leukemia. Patient's condition deteriorated within 10 days of the postoperative period and succumbed to the disease due to extensive involvement by AML."
"A 25-year-old female patient was referred to the Department of Orthodontics, Dental School, Shahed University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Past medical history revealed a kidney cyst, but the patient did not suffer from any systemic disease. Clinical examinations eliminated the possibilities of any developmental disorders and syndromes. Extra-oral examination did not reveal any abnormality. In intraoral examination, mild spacing in both of dental arches was noted. Her upper left lateral incisor, second premolar and first molar were in dental crossbite without any functional shift. She had class III occlusal relationships and cephalometric evaluation revealed a class III skeletal pattern (). In her panoramic radiograph, four impacted third molars were present (Figure 2). Significant root dilaceration of maxillary lateral incisors and right first premolar was evident. Surprisingly, an impacted supernumerary canine was noted on the right side of the mandible and a primary canine accompanied by two impacted teeth, both resembling a canine, was present on the left side of the mandible. All of the three impacted teeth had fully-developed roots, and showed the configuration, size and root length of a permanent canine (Figures & ). Occlusal radiograph revealed the impacted tooth on the right was lingual and both of impacted teeth on the left were buccal (). According to the patient, there was no history of tooth extraction. The parents did not have supernumerary teeth; the patient had no siblings.\nFixed orthodontic treatment started for the patient. After six months of treatment including leveling and aligning, the right canine and first premolar were not properly aligned because of the impacted supernumerary canine; therefore, surgical removal of the supernumerary tooth was carried out.\nAnother surgical session was planned for the left side, in which the distal impacted canine was removed after extraction of the ankylosed primary canine, and a bracket was placed on the mesial canine for forced eruption because of its longer root. Both of the extracted teeth had the size and anatomy of a normal canine ()."
"A 25-year-old Arab-Berber man, without prior relevant medical history, with lower abdominal pain which had persisted for 10 days presented to our emergency department. The character of the pain was intense and persistent, accompanied with fever, vomiting, and low urinary tract symptoms (for example, polakiuria). On physical examination, he looked tired and his body temperature was 39.5C. Abdominal examination revealed a diffuse tender lower abdomen and midline suprapubic mass measuring 5cm in length. The umbilicus looked normal and no peritoneal signs were elicited. A rectal examination revealed no tenderness and no blood. Laboratory data revealed leucocytosis with 82% neutrophil predominance and a white blood cell count of 13,000/L. Blood biochemistry was normal. Urinalysis was normal and urine culture showed no bacterial growth. A standing abdomen radiography was normal. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) revealed a hypoechoic tract from the umbilicus to the abdominal wall (Figure ) and a hypoechoic mass with heteroechogenic content between the peritoneum, the muscle layer, and the bladder, without fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The suggested diagnosis was infection of urachal remnants. Treatment was initiated with a broad empirical (amoxiclav + gentamicin) antibiotic accompanied by percutaneous drainage. Cystoscopy was performed but showed no evidence of a bladder anomaly. Finally, extraperitoneal excision of the urachal remnant, including a cuff of bladder, was performed. There were no postoperative complications, and anatomophological analysis did not reveal a tumor of the urachal remnant. The pus culture found a Proteus mirabilis infection for which he was treated with ciprofloxacin. At 18 months post-operatively, he was asymptomatic and no abnormalities of the abdominal wall were seen."
"A female patient 25 years old come to our department with chief complaint of swelling in bilateral cheeks. The duration of the swelling was 10 month and the growth was slow in nature. She gave a medical history of similar bilateral swellings when she was 12 years old and had underwent surgery for the same. On examination, the swelling was firm and slightly tender on right side. Examination of the face showed frontal bossing, broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism, and mandibular prognathism ().\nOrthopantomograph revealed multiple multilocular well-defined radiolucencies with sclerotic border located in maxilla and mandible ().\nThe presence of multiple cysts in the jaws and extraoral examination raised a suspicion of Gorlin syndrome and so other relevant investigations were done.\nChest radiograph showed a bifid fifth rib (). The reports of the patient also revealed the presence of nabothian cyst in cervix.\nAn incisional biopsy of the swelling in left and right side of mandible was advised. Histopathological examination of specimen revealed parakeratinised stratified squamous epithelium with palisading pattern of columnar cells along with keratin flakes with few giant cells and inflammatory cells (found in the specimen of the left side of the mandible) suggestive of odontogenic keratocyst on the right side and an odontogenic keratocyst with secondary infection on the left side (Figures and ). Surgical enucleation of the cysts was performed in the department of oral surgery. Any skin lesions like basal cell nevus or keratosis were not seen in the patient. Thorough clinical and radiological examination were done for the parents of the patient but they showed no signs of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome.\nBased on the clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings, and referring to the diagnostic criteria for nevoid BCC syndrome established by Evanset al. [], and modified by Kimonos et al. in 1997 [], the patient was diagnosed as having Gorlin-Goltz syndrome."
"A 25-year-old man presented with increasingly severe right-sided headache attacks with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features. His first attack was characterised by a sharp retroorbital pain with ipsilateral lacrimation, conjunctival congestion, and nasal stuffiness. He was agitated throughout the pain, which lasted 15–30 minutes, and he slept for seven hours afterwards. Three months later he experienced an identical attack, and the frequency gradually increased to between two and three episodes per day. The attacks were stereotypical, being exclusively right-sided with extreme agitation during the pain. Prior to seeking medical help, he was contemplating suicide due to the severity of his symptoms. He had previously been fit and well apart from a history of migraine. The latter was described as intermittent mild-to-moderate headache attacks lasting several hours with associated photophobia, phonophobia, and aggravation with movement, easily distinguishable from the current headache presentation.\nA diagnosis of cluster headache was made and abortive therapy with subcutaneous sumatriptan and high-flow oxygen was given, with no clinical response. Prophylactic therapy with high-dose verapamil did not have any effect on the attack frequency or duration. Given the refractory symptoms, an MRI scan was performed which showed a large pituitary adenoma with right-sided cavernous sinus invasion (). The serum prolactin was significantly elevated at 54,700 mU/L (normal range 50–400 mU/L), with normal IGF1 and growth hormone 0.4 mU/L, excluding acromegaly; the remainder of the pituitary function was normal. A pituitary macroprolactinoma was diagnosed and the patient was prescribed cabergoline 0.5 mg twice/week. Over the next four days he described a sensation of parasthesia over the scalp, since which he has not experienced a single headache attack. An MRI scan performed several months later showed significant reduction in tumour volume with resolution of cavernous sinus invasion (). Since followup in the endocrine clinic, he has become gonadotropin deficient, requiring testosterone gel replacement, and he remains headache-free with a serum prolactin of 627 mU/L."
"A 25-year-old female patient complained of hypersensitivity in the lower front teeth region since 2 months and was concerned about the esthetics. Patient had gingival recession on the mandibular right central incisor at the first examination (). The clinical attachment loss was 5 mm from the CEJ. Oral prophylaxis has been done and oral hygiene instructions were given so as to achieve satisfactory plaque control prior to periodontal surgery. The root surface was gently scaled and planed; instrumentation was done by utilizing manual and power driven scalers and curets. The shape of the root was not altered. The root surface was then treated with a tetracycline 500 mg by attempting to burnish, with small cotton pledgets. The donor tissue was removed from the palate and trimmed to a thickness of 2 to 3 mm (). Within minutes of removal, the donor tissue was placed at the recipient site. Vertical stabilizing sutures (4–0 silk) were used to secure the graft (). Postoperative healing after 6 months reveal excellent healing of the site and complete coverage of recession was achieved ()."
"A 25-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with an 8-hour history of cramps and abdominal pain accompanied by anorexia and nausea. Since the beginning of his symptoms, he had passed one loose stool. His medical history was unremarkable except for an endoscopically inserted saline-filled intragastric balloon 5 months prior. On further investigation, it became clear that 24 hours after balloon placement the patient's symptoms (nausea and abdominal pain following balloon insertion) had suddenly disappeared and his urine had turned blue. The following day, endoscopy was repeated, and the gastric mucosa and balloon appeared normal without any signs of deflation or leakage.\nThe patient's initial body mass index (BMI) was 35.18, and during these 5 months he had lost 12 kilograms of his weight, reaching a BMI of 31.31.\nOn physical examination, he was in moderate distress and a state of mild dehydration. On abdominal palpation, he had diffuse tenderness in his epigastric and umbilical regions, though it was soft without any guarding or rebound and his bowel sounds were active. After admission, the patient began to present bilious vomiting and obstipation. An abdominal radiograph was taken, showing air fluid levels and small bowel distention concomitant with bowel obstruction. On the following day, the patient underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in which gastroesophageal reflux disease type A (GERD-A) in the esophagus and reflux gastropathy in the stomach were observed and biopsied. No evidence of the balloon was found inside the stomach, confirming that it had migrated to the bowel.\nThe initial treatment consisted of fluid resuscitation and nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion for bowel decompression. Oral and intravenous contrast computed tomography (CT) scans were performed and showed the balloon occluding the distal ileum (). Proximal to the obstruction, dilated loops with air-fluid levels were visible, and distal to the obstruction, collapsed loops could be observed. In some images, intestinal wall thickening was also observed. After 48 hours of close observation, in hopes that the obstruction would resolve through conservative treatment, the patient was taken to the operation room, and laparotomy (6 cm mid-line incision) was performed. There was a small bowel obstruction due to migration of the balloon to a site 150 cm from the ileocecal valve. Enterotomy was performed, and the balloon was deflated and extracted. On the first postoperative day, the NGT was removed and on the second day, an oral diet began and the patient who had experienced an uneventful recovery was discharged."
"Endodontic non-surgical treatment was performed on tooth #29 in a 25-year-old male patient. No medical history was reported for the patient. The chief compliant was pain in the lowerright back teeth. After performing vitality and percussion tests and radiographic examination, the diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis with normal periapical status was made ().\nOn preoperative periapical radiograph, presence of two canals was observed with bifurcation on cervical one third of the root. After administration of local anesthesia (lidocaine 2% and 1:100,000 epinephrine) and preparation of the access cavity, two canals were found in buccal and lingual aspects, both located in the mesial half of the tooth. After establishing the working length and chemo-mechanical preparation of the two canals found in a similar manner to the two previous cases, canals were dried and a careful inspection of pulp floor and walls under operating microscope was performed. This revealed a third canal which could be negotiated with a 0.08 K-file (Maillefer) (). Working length was determined by an apex locator and confirmed by radiograph.\nThe third canal was cleaned and shaped, and obturation of the three canals was accomplished by lateral compaction technique with gutta-percha and AH26 sealer ().\nThe tooth was symptom-free and had normal periapex on radiograph in six-month follow-up ()."
"A 25-year-old medically fit and well male patient presented twice within a two-week period at a dental emergency clinic. First presentation was due to a 7-day history of constant aching pain affecting the left side of his face, and the patient could isolate the pain to the left mandible. Extraoral and intraoral soft tissue examination was unremarkable. Periodontally there were no pathological pockets, and oral hygiene was good. Dentally the patient had an unrestored adult dentition with absent third molars and no detectable caries. The lower left first premolar tooth was markedly tender to percussion, and a long-cone periapical radiograph (LCPA) revealed a significant periapical radiolucency (). A diagnosis of acute apical periodontitis was confirmed although the cause of loss of vitality was unexplained, without apparent coronal or periodontal pathology being identifiable. The patient was offered extraction or pulp extirpation, and the patient opted to save the tooth. The tooth was successfully accessed and dressed with ledermix, cotton wool, and glass ionomer cement (GIC). The patient was discharged to find a general dental practitioner (GDP) to complete root canal treatment.\nTwo weeks later, the patient reattended the same dental emergency clinic complaining of constant aching pain affecting the lower right mandible. Once again, no decay or periodontal issues were found clinically, but LCPA examination of the lower right quadrant showed periapical pathology associated with the mandibular right first premolar tooth (). A diagnosis of acute apical periodontitis was confirmed, and the patient again had pulp extirpation completed."
"This 25-year-old Caucasian woman presented with severe abdominal pain and symptoms of intestinal obstruction at 37-week gestation. During her 2nd and 3rd trimesters she developed facial hirsutism, deepening voice, facial acne, and clitoromegaly. Her past medical history included recurrent UTI as a child, asthma for which she had received oral steroids intermittently, and 4 laparoscopies (aged 17–24 years) at which endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome was diagnosed.\nHer biochemistry revealed testosterone 45.0 nmol/L (normal range 1–3.2), SHBG (sex-hormone-binding globulin) 391 nmol/L (range 20–155), androstenedione > 200 nmol/L (range 0.6–80), 17 OH-progesterone 295.0 nmol/L (range < 13.0), CEA 1.8 ng/mL (range < 6.0), and CA125 389.7 U/mL (range < 35.0)\nShe underwent a pelvic ultrasound that revealed a large complex left-sided pelvic/abdominal mass. Subsequent MRI highlighted a large ovarian malignancy (Figures and ). A Caesarean section was performed along with left salpingo-oophorectomy, appendicectomy, right ovarian, and omental biopsies. She delivered a healthy male who has been karyotyped as XY.\nHistopathology confirmed a left ovarian moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 265 × 220 × 125 mm, a likely metastatic deposit from a gastrointestinal primary. Following delivery, her androgen profile returned to normal. Staging CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no new pathology. At colonoscopy a moderately differentiated invasive caecal adenocarcinoma was biopsied. Following a literature search, MDT discussion, and involvement of Scottish oncology and fertility experts she proceeded to a right hemicolectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, and peritoneal biopsies. Her disease was staged pT3, N2, M1 (6 of 19 nodes were involved and there was extramural venous invasion). The right ovary, resection margins, and peritoneum were disease-free. The tumour was oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative. She was referred for adjuvant chemotherapy. Her testosterone levels did have a transient rise postoperatively but returned quickly to within normal limits. The affected ovary has been further examined to determine whether it was tumour or ovarian tissue that was responsible for her abnormal biochemical profile."
"A 25-year-old HIV-negative female presented to the emergency department with constant sharp left lower quadrant pain for 1 day accompanied by nausea and three episodes of vomiting. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks prior to presentation. Although the patient had received treatment for PID 2 weeks prior to this visit, her male sexual partner had not been treated for any sexually transmitted infections. She denied diarrhea, fever, urinary symptoms, vaginal bleeding, or discharge. At triage, her temperature was 101.0°F, blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats/min, respiratory rate was 20/min, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. The patient had no surgical history, and sexual history was significant for multiple male partners without consistent use of barrier protection.\nOn physical examination, the lungs were clear, the heart sounds were fast and regular, and the abdomen was soft with left lower quadrant tenderness without rebound or guarding. Pelvic examination was difficult to interpret as the patient was in a significant degree of discomfort. On speculum examination, there was no blood in the vaginal vault, and there was a small amount of clear discharge from the cervical os. On bimanual examination, the patient had tenderness of the cervical area, the uterus, and the bilateral adnexae, left greater than right. It was unclear if distinct CMT was present as the patient was uncomfortable with the entire bimanual examination. A point-of-care test of the urine was negative for pregnancy and infection.\nA BUS was performed. The patient tolerated the probe insertion but had a significant amount of pain when the probe abutted the cervix (Figure ). With pressure applied to the probe to directly visualize the cervix, the patient felt a focal exacerbation of her pain, which the EP recognized, clarified, and confirmed as CMT. A coronal view of the left adnexal region demonstrated a complex heterogeneous collection thought to represent an abscess (Figure ).\nThe gynecology service was consulted, and an ultrasound in the department of radiology was obtained to further evaluate the adnexae and document blood flow to the ovaries. The left adnexa was found to be an enlarged tubo-ovarian complex. It was estimated to measure 8 cm in diameter with multiple irregular tubo-ovarian abscesses. The ovaries demonstrated bilateral blood flow. There was a small amount of free fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac.\nLaboratory studies showed a WBC count of 15.0. The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics and admitted to the gynecology service. Microbiology result of the cervical culture was positive for N. gonorrhea."
"A 25-year-old woman with a 1-year history of pancolonic UC was started on oral and topical mesalazine treatment as an outpatient in our hospital because her disease was in the moderately active phase. There was no clinical, radiographic, or endoscopic evidence of Crohn's disease at this time. Before starting the treatment, she also complained of upper abdominal discomfort. Therefore, we performed endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract, which showed multiple small erosions in the duodenal bulb and diffuse granular changes in the descending portion of the duodenum that were similar in appearance to colonic lesions of UC (). There were no abnormal findings in the stomach including the gastric antrum. Histological examinations of biopsies from the duodenal lesions revealed a decrease of goblet cells, severe chronic inflammation with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, and cryptitis (). Neither granuloma nor H. pylori was detected in the biopsy specimen. Although the symptoms of UC (bloody diarrhea and lower abdominal pain) improved after administration of oral and topical mesalazine, her upper abdominal discomfort did not improve despite administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). However, additional administration of oral prednisolone promptly improved the upper abdominal discomfort. Oral prednisolone was gradually tapered off and completely stopped after 2 months. She is now under continuous observation at our hospital while continuing mesalazine treatment. She has not developed any Crohn's-like complications such as fistulas, sinus tracts, or strictures during the follow-up time of about 4 years."
"A 25-year-old,non-smoker turkish man was admitted to hospital with complaints of chest pain and cough. The chest radiography showed well-defined, rounded opacities on the left hemithorax (Figure\n). The thorax CT and MRI revealed vascular aneurysms with in situ thrombosis on the left pulmonary artery (Figure\n and\n). The patient had history of recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers. The skin pathergy test was positive (Figure\n). BD was diagnosed based on these findings. The treatment was started with intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (250 mg per day for 3 days) and monthly 1,000 mg cyclophosphamide, and followed by 1 mg/kg per day of methylprednisolone orally, colchium and intravenous pulse of 1,000 mg cyclophosphamidemonthly. Thorax CT was repeated after 2 months of treatment. It showed that PAAs were reduced and in situ thrombosis in PAAs was completely resolved with immunosuppressive treatment (Figure\n). The approval of patient and of institution were taken to use their records for our study."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian male presented to our practice in 2003 complaining of an alopecic scalp lesion in both his temples, which was present since his childhood. The lesions did not increase in size nor did it produce any symptoms.\nScalp examination revealed an oval, slightly lancet-shaped hypotrichotic patches measuring approximately 8 × 5 cm and 8 × 4 cm on the left and right temples, respectively, located supra-aurically (Figures and ). There were no other signs such as erythema, scaling, or atrophy. A 4 mm punch biopsy was taken from the right-sided patch that showed a sparse superficial perivascular and perifollicular infiltrate of lymphocytes. The hair follicles appeared thinner and shorter as well as lipoatrophy. The clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with TTA. The remainder of his cutaneous examination showed the presence of multiple capillary malformations, mostly involving the right upper limb, chest, abdomen, and the back (Figures and ), for which the patient is receiving laser therapy. In addition, he also had a bilateral nevus of Ota (), and a nevus spilus located on the chest (). He did not have any other remarkable cutaneous or systemic findings. The constellation of his cutaneous findings (capillary malformation, nevus of Ota, and nevus spilus) led to the clinical diagnosis of Phakomatosis Pigmentovascularis type IVa.\nHair restoration surgery with follicular unit transplantation was offered to the patient as a possible treatment which he accepted. The preoperative workout was unremarkable. Patient underwent two sessions one year apart where a 0.7 cm × 5 cm strip was harvested from the occipital donor region, the right half on the first session and the left half on the second session. In total, 1449 follicular units were obtained from both surgeries using stereomicroscopic dissection. The grafts were placed in the TTA patches with a final density of approximately 35 FU/cm2. Patient had no postoperative complications after either procedures. Sutures from the donor area were removed seven and ten days after the first and second sessions, respectively. Figures , and demonstrate the results after six years after the last surgery. Patient was satisfied with results and did not require any further treatment.\nReview of the literature shows, including our case, that hair restoration surgery using follicular unit transplantation is an effective and successful treatment modality for temporal triangular alopecia. In our case report, there was, as well, a consistent result over a six-year followup. We recommend that hair restoration surgery should be offered as a first-line treatment option for this particular type of alopecia."
"Case one was a 25-year-old Egyptian man, known to be a cigarette smoker, who presented with a one-year history of axial low back pain, not radiating to his lower limbs, after falling from height. His pain was mechanical, exacerbated by standing or walking for extended periods of time and improved by lying down, and refractory to extensive conservative treatment. During a physical examination our patient showed no sensory-motor deficits. A lumbar MRI showed evidence of L4 spondylolysis with no spondylolisthesis or foraminal stenosis (Figure ). The operative time was 120 minutes, and blood loss was minimal (50mL). Our patient was ambulatory after surgery and reported relief from back pain (maximal pain severity of 10 at pretreatment reduced to three after treatment), improvements in back function (from 68% to 15% on the Oswestry Disability Index), and no complications. Our patient was discharged from the hospital two days after the procedure. To confirm the adequate placement of the instrumentation, as shown in the graphic representation (Figure ), and to accurately evaluate the final constructs, a CT scan was obtained after the operation. Successful fusion, defined as no motion at the treated segment on flexion or extension radiographs and evidence of bone growth between the adjacent vertebral bodies on reconstructed CT images, was demonstrated at up to one-year follow-up (Figure )."
"A Middle Eastern male in his twenties presented as an asymptomatic carrier with serum α1AT levels in the low-carrier range of 0.58 g/l (11 µM) as measured by nephelometry, and a Z/M2 phenotype classification as measured by IEF. Attempted confirmation of α1AT allele status using the Invader™-based assay (Focus Diagnostics Inc., Cypress, CA) for Z and S allele detection, and targeted Sanger sequencing over the codon 342 region (extending 300 bases) suggested an incorrect IEF diagnosis."
"A 25-year-old unemployed Cameroonian woman was admitted with one-month history of high persistent fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Her past history, especially concerning HIV infection, was unknown. She had been self-medicated with antipyretic and antimalaria drugs but she did not recover. On physical examination the patient appeared weak, with fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Her temperature was 38,5°C, with a pulse 30 beats per minute. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and she had severe weight loss of more than 10 kg. No lymphadenopathy was noted and findings on lung and cardiac examination were unremarkable. The patient's abdomen was distended and tender with a palpable liver tip. She had difficulties with attention and on neurological examination she could not walk because of fatigue but she showed no focal neurologic deficits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-Ray were normal. Laboratory test results revealed pancytopenia, hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, and ASAT: 352 IU/L, ALAT: 59 IU/L. HIV1 serology was positive and CD4 was 7/mm3. Urine culture was sterile. The peripheral blood film showed no indication of malaria parasites, but it revealed the presence of yeast-like organisms with clear halo and eccentric chromatin, 2 to 4 μm in diameter, inside and next to monocytes and also scattered within red blood cells (Figures and ), confirming to the morphology of Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum. Blood culture in Sabouraud medium isolated Hc (). The patient died just after all the samples were collected. The postmortem diagnosis of DH revealing AIDS in terminal phase was concluded."
"A 25-year old man presented with weakness and paresthesia in his upper limbs.\nAxial T2-weighted MR image of the cervical spinal column () revealed a bilateral dumbbellshaped high signal cervical cord mass which was proved to be neurofibroma after biopsy. There is also an intra-dural extra-medullary mass with compressive effect on the adjacent cord as can be seen on sagittal T1-weighted image without contrast (), sagittal () and coronal T2-weighted images () and on the myelograms ( & ). The lesion was proved to be a neurofibroma after surgical resection.\nThe above findings are compatible with neurofibromatosis type one."
"A 25-year-old man, with a height of 153 cm, referred to the Department of Oral Medicine, Mashhad Faculty of Dentistry, with a chief complaint of toothache in the right upper jaw. Intraoral examination showed multiple carious teeth in both jaws. The patient was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology for further investigation.\nPanoramic radiograph revealed a general increase in bone density with absence of normal trabecular pattern involving both jaws, hypoplastic maxillary sinuses and multiple dental caries with pulpoperiapical pathoses. The impacted third molars and left upper quadrant premolars were seen with retained left maxillary deciduous molars and left mandibular lateral incisor. Bilateral missed second premolars of the mandible were also noted ().\nRight hand posteroanterior (PA) radiograph showed hyperdense bones, particularly in the carpals, radius and ulna. Obliteration of cancellous bones, resulting in the loss of corticomedulary demarcation was observed. A previous fracture of the proximal phalanx of the first finger was also noted. The other radiographic finding of the hand x-ray was the presence of “bone-within-bone” appearance in metacarpal and phalangeal bones (). In addition, the former anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views of the tibia and fibula demonstrated generalized osteosclerosis and multiple previous fractures ().\nThe hemogram findings of the patient showed that his hemoglobin, hematocrit and RBC counts were lower than normal. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was also noted. Serum calcium, phosphorous and alkaline phosphatase levels were within normal ranges.\nAccording to the multiple maxillary pulpoperiapical lesions, he was referred to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian man was seen at our policlinic one month after he had fallen on his outstretched hand. He was first treated with a below arm cast with the wrist at neutral flexion for a distal radioulnar joint sprain. Four weeks later his cast was removed and we found that he was still having pain and swelling of the ECU tendon during pronation and supination of the forearm. Although the ECU subluxation diagnosis was made clinically we also had the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the patient’s wrist which displayed an increased signal on T2-weighted images consistent with inflammation around the ECU tendon (Figure\n).\nSurgical exploration was carried out using axillary block anesthesia under pneumatic tourniquet control. The patient’s extensor retinaculum was found to be intact which was opened longitudinally. However, his fibrosseus sheath which was tightly binding the tendon at the ulnar groove was found to be torn from the ulnar attachment (Figure\n). The ECU tendon was found to be dislocating during supination (Figure\n) and relocating during pronation.\nThe sheath was reconstructed using extensor retinaculum due to attenuation of the subsheath.\nAfter the operation the patient’s arm was kept in a long arm cast for five weeks with the elbow in 90º of flexion and neutral forearm rotation. The reason for keeping his arm in a long arm cast for five weeks was to prevent relocation. The patient returned to normal activities four months after the operation.\nThere was no recurrent dislocation of the ECU tendon of the patient at his last follow up 12 months after the operation (Figures\n and\n)."
"A 25-year-old G4, P4 Caucasian female presented with a history of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea seven months post-partum. On physical examination, she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 bpm and a normal blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. The heart sounds were within normal limits with decreased breath sounds bilaterally and lower limb edema. Initial blood work including the complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests and cardiac biomarkers were within normal limits. The electocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia and the chest x-ray confirmed cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous congestion. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated biventricular dilation, biatrial enlargement, global hypokinesis of the left ventricle (LV) with an ejection fraction less than 20%. There were multiple echodense masses within the LV, consistent with thrombi (Figure \n). With a diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), the patient was appropriately started on diuretics, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and parenteral heparin for the LV thrombi. A subsequent cardiac MRI (CMR) 4 days later confirmed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, with significant resolution of the thrombi previously detected on TTE (Figure \n)."
"Case 2. A healthy 25- year-old male reported to College of Dental Sciences & Hospital, Rau, Indore, India, with a lump in his back teeth. According to the patient, the reddish purple lump has been present for approximately 6 months and the lump was interfering with his bite and felt uncomfortable. Occasionally bleeding occurred when he brushed his teeth. Clinical examination revealed erythematous interdental papilla in relation to maxillary central incisors 11,12 visible from facial aspect with no evidence of lesion palatally. The lesion appeared exophytic and nodular with irregular surface. It measured approximately 10 mm laterally and 8 mm in anterior-posterior direction and 6 mm thick. It was slightly pedunculated with what appeared to be a broad-based attachment. The lesion was neither fluctuant nor did it blanch on pressure, but had a rubbery consistency. It was tender ()."
"A 25-year-old primipara patient was admitted to hospital at 32 weeks of pregnancy due to a headache for 1 month and blurred vision for 20 days. The patient was in the third trimester of pregnancy. Ultrasonography (USG) showed a single intrauterine live pregnancy with occiput presentation. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a left frontoparietal mass (size: 6x5x5 cm) with peripheral enhancement (), with a shift of the median line.\nAfter multidisciplinary consultation with the neurosurgery, obstetrics and anesthesiology departments, the initial decision was to delay the neurosurgery until after delivery. The patient and her family agreed with this strategy. The decision was made to treat the patient with dexamethasone to control the cerebral edema and accelerate fetal lung maturity. However, the patient’s visual acuity rapidly worsened. Therefore, the patient was scheduled for a CS and neurosurgical resection of the tumor under general anesthesia at 34 weeks’ gestation.\nA live 1,900-g female was delivered 6 min after the skin incision. The neonate’s Apgar score at 1 min was 8 and after 2 min, the Apgar score sharply decreased to 3. The neonate was resuscitated immediately with intermittent positive pressure breathing and 0.04 mg naloxone was administered intramuscularly 5 min later. The Apgar score returned 8. The neonate was then admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.\nOxytocin (10 units) was administered i.v. to improve the uterine contraction. Following delivery, the neurosurgical resection of the tumor was performed uneventfully. The patient recovered quickly from anesthesia without any neurological deficit and was extubated in the operating room.\nThe pathology laboratory revealed an astrocytoma, which was WHO grade III. The positive expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), CD34, p53, Olig-2, vimentin and isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) were observed by immunohistochemical staining techniques. The patient was discharged 7 days after surgery. Adjuvant therapy was initiated 2 weeks after surgery. The patient completed radiotherapy and chemotherapy by taking temozolomide for 6 months post-craniectomy. The mother remained in a good condition and the baby was observed to develop normally throughout the 12-month follow-up period."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with a central scotoma in the left eye that had appeared 5 days ago. She had a flu-like syndrome 10 days preceding the visual blurring and she had already undergone an extensive neurologic examination that was negative. She had not inhaled poppers.\nBest-corrected visual acuity in the left eye was 20/32. Color fundus photography of the left eye revealed a yellowish hypopigmented area in the macula. Autofluorescence measurement and fluorescein angiography were normal (Figures –). B-scan SD-OCT revealed a disruption of the inner band of retinal pigment epithelium and IS/OS junction. Further, OCT showed small hyperreflective deposits between the IS/OS junction and the outer nuclear layer. Around this disrupted foveal area, IS/OS junction thickening could be observed as a fusion between the IS/OS junction and the RPE inner band. The late phases of ICGA revealed a hypofluorescent lesion with a hyperfluorescent halo with a cockade-like appearance (). “En face” OCT scan at the level of the IS/OS junction demonstrated a hyperreflective halo surrounding the hyporeflective fovea. The halo corresponded to the faint hyperreflective IS/OS junction thickening around the disrupted foveal area. Correlation with late phase ICGA revealed that the “en-face” OCT cockade-like appearance matches the pattern observed on ICGA. Moreover, punctuate hyperreflective foveolar spots corresponding to the central deposits found in the acute phase at the outer nuclear layer level in the B-scan match the hyperreflective point observed on “en-face” OCT (Figures –).\nOne month later, SD-OCT B-scan demonstrated a return to normality while “en-face” scans showed an incomplete recovery of the disrupted central IS/OS junction (Figures , ). A transient, slight, hyperreflective macular star could be detected at the outer nuclear layer level ()."
"A 25-year-old nulliparous Caucasian woman at 40-week gestation with an uneventful antenatal period had an emergency Caesarean section for failure to progress during the second stage of labour. She had been pushing vigorously for 3 hours 16 minutes during the second stage of labour whilst inhaling Entonox. There were cephalopelvic disproportion and extensive caput of the foetal head. A decision was made to proceed to Caesarean section and not to attempt vaginal instrumentation. She received spinal anaesthetic for the procedure, and a healthy girl weighing 3300 g was delivered.\nOn the second postpartum day she noted crackly skin over both sides of her neck and the front of her chest whilst applying body lotion. She denied any dysphagia or dyspnoea. However, on further questioning she did report some chest discomfort whilst on the operating table. She had been tolerating a normal diet.\nOn examination she was not in respiratory distress, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and heart rate 72 bpm. She was afebrile. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and air entry was equal bilaterally. There was crepitus on palpation of the upper anterior chest wall and on both sides of her neck up to the mandible.\nChest radiography revealed an extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, but there was no obvious pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. The patient refused to have a CT scan, as she was concerned about the radiation dose. She was discharged home on the fourth postpartum day, as she was asymptomatic apart from the palpable crepitus. Over the course of the next three days she was followed up with home visits by the midwife, and the subcutaneous emphysema had completely resolved. She declined further imaging for followup."
"A 25-year-old gravida 0, para 0 woman presented to a breast radiologist with a short history of a rapidly growing palpable and painful tumor in the left breast. Clinical and radiologic findings (ultrasound) were suggestive of juvenile fibroadenoma or intraductal papilloma (BI-RADS Category 2) and the patient was referred to the breast surgeon. The excision biopsy was performed and intraoperative frozen section consultation was obtained which read as a benign fibroepithelial tumor with focal intratumoral hemorrhage without signs of malignancy.\nGross examination revealed a nodular, circumscribed tumor, measuring 25×20×17 mm that was soft, yellow with peripheral areas of hemorrhage. The entire tumor was submitted for histopathologic evaluation which revealed juvenile (cellular) fibroadenoma with foci of hemorrhage and necrosis (Figure\nA-B). No evidence of malignancy was found."
"25-year-old man who had catastrophic loss of facial tissues after high voltage injury. After 20 procedures including multiple flaps covered with skin grafts, other surgical options were exhausted and the patient underwent full face transplantation."
"A 25 year old woman with amenorrhoea of 10 weeks duration, presented to the University Teaching Hospital at Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, South East Nigeria. She had fever and rigors for one week and had not responded to anti-malarials and antibiotics. She developed abdominal pains for 2 days before presentation. At presentation, her axillary temperature was 38.3°C. A pregnancy test was positive. Urinalysis showed proteinuria (1+) and casts (2+). A positive tap of non-clotting blood led to a diagnosis of ruptured ectopic gestation. She had exploratory laparotomy at which no ectopic pregnancy was found. A suspected inflamed appendix was removed by the general surgeon who was invited. However, she continued to bleed from the wound edges. She was re-explored and was discovered to be bleeding intraperitonealy. The abnormal bleeding led to suspicion of Lassa fever and a blood sample was sent to Irrua for confirmatory diagnosis. She later died in the intensive care unit before the result was received. She was not treated with ribavirin. Two gynaecologists, two surgeons, an anaesthetist and a nurse anaesthetist took ill with Lassa fever between 6-9 days later. They did not receive post exposure prophylaxis. They were all transferred to Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital for treatment. One death was recorded."
A 25-year old male with uncontrolled asthma. Initial FEV1 was 2.51 L (62.6%) and severe sputum eosinophilia. His CT scan shows diffuse bronchitis with tree bud sign and then treated with clarithromycin for 9 months. FEV1was improved from 62.6% to 88.4%. He reduced daily amount of inhaled corticosteroid.
"A 25-year-old man with NF1 was referred to our clinic for an ophthalmological examination. The NF1 diagnosis was made on the basis of several café-au-lait spots and cutaneous neurofibromas. The patient's family and personal medical history added no significant information. He had no visual symptoms. His best-corrected visual acuity was 1.2 in both eyes. There were at least 3 Lisch nodules on each side. Ophthalmoscopic examinations of the fundi did not show any abnormalities (Figures and ). However, IR-FAF (Heidelberg Retina Angiograph 2, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) revealed multiple bright, patchy lesions in the posterior pole of the choroid. These lesions were much more prominent in the right eye than the left (Figures and ). OCT (RS-3000, NIDEK, Japan) images of these lesions revealed irregular, hyperreflective choroidal foci (). OCT revealed no abnormality of the outer retina."
"A 25-year-old man was referred by his general dental practitioner to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology regarding a periapical lesion related to the apex of the upper right molar teeth and prosthetic management. Intraoral examination revealed that there were a few teeth with caries in different regions. Panoramic radiography revealed a well-defined radiolucency involving the root apices of the upper right maxillary first molar (). The borders exhibited dense radiopaque features. Provisional diagnosis of the radicular cyst was established, and root canal treatment was carried out. Endodontic retreatment was initiated by his dentist, but after a followup of several months, no changes were observed in the ovoid radiolucency, and the patient was referred for consultation to our department. The patient's medical history was unremarkable, included no trauma of the jaws, and he had not undergone any jaw surgery. He was not aware of the radiolucent area before his routine dental examination and had no sensory or motor deficiency. The tooth was asymptomatic and it also presented with a poor root canal filling. The overlying mucosa of the lesion was quite normal, and there was no sign of infection or fistula. The overall appearance of the lesion seemed to be that of a radicular cyst of the right maxillary first molar. On performance of vitality tests, all the teeth except the first molar- in the mentioned area appeared to be vital.\nTo reveal the exact location definition of the pathologic features, he was referred for a CBCT (NewTom 5G, QR, Verona, Italy) scan. After this, a CBCT was taken which revealed the maxillary sinus with its border extending but not involving the roots of the mentioned teeth, which is one of the anatomical variations of maxillary sinus (–). The dimensions of the defect were 13.2 × 14.2 × 9.3 mm depth (mesiodistal length, inferosuperior height, and buccolingual depth)."
"A 25-year-old man visited our hospital with ocular pain on the left eye, showing corneal shield ulcer and atopic conjunctivitis. Eye drops of 0.1% of betamethasone sodium phosphate and 0.1% of hyaluronic acid ophthalmic solution were prescribed, but his ocular pain and corneal findings persisted. The corrected visual acuity was 6/20 in Snellen chart at the first visit. At 40 days after the beginning of treatment, calcific corneal opacities developed in the corneal epithelium. Six months after the first visit, the corrected visual acuity decreased to 4/20, and keratectomy was planned to remove calcification in the cornea ().\nThe operative procedure included corneal epithelial exfoliation over almost the entire cornea using a golf club spud, followed by removal of corneal opacity using MQA (MQA eco-stick, Inami, Tokyo, Japan) soaked in 0.05 M of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) []. After washing the eye with 200 mL of physiological saline, a silicon hydrogel lens, PureVisionTM (balafilcon A) (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY, U.S.), was inserted to obtain pain relief for the therapeutic use. We have got obtain permission by ethics committee of our hospital for this procedure. Postoperative medication included instillation of levofloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.1% fluorometholone ophthalmic solution, and 0.1% hyaluronic acid ophthalmic solution 4 times a day for 2 weeks. Ofloxacin eye ointment was applied twice daily for only 4 days. At the end of the surgery, a silicone hydrogel lens was inserted continuously for 1 week to reduce ocular pain.\nAt postoperative day 11, wearing second lens after post-operative day 7, mucin balls were found between cornea and contact lens and were stained with rose bengal eye solution. One of them was atypically larger than usual size, which could vary between about 20 and 200 μm. In the present case, the major axis was approximately 1.5 mm (). At the same time, as corneal erosion was diminished, wearing silicone hydrogel lens was stopped and instillation of every eye drop was continued until the disappearing of all the corneal staining. One week later (at post-operative day 18), all of mucin balls and corneal staining were disappeared and the corrected visual acuity increased to 6/20. Little corneal opacity remained, and visual acuity after surgery recovered to 14/20 at five months (). There was no change between preoperative corneal endothelial cell density (2797.5 ± 100.8 cells/mm2) and postoperative (2840.6 ± 123.1 cells/mm2)."
"A 25-year-old woman with the complaint of persistent drainage of pus in the right mandibular vestibule region was referred to the Endodontic Department of Tabriz Dental School. Patient’s medical history revealed no significant findings.\nOn clinical examination, the right mandibular first molar was sensitive to percussion; however, probing depth and mobility were within normal range. Right mandibular first molar showed no response to thermal and electric pulp testing. Tracing with gutta-percha pointed to the right first mandibular molar as the origin of the draining sinus tract. Radiographic examination also revealed furcal and apical radiolucency [A]. Diagnosis of pulp necrosis with chronic periradicular periodontitis was established. After isolation with rubber dam, standard access cavity was prepared, and canal instrumentation was started. The instrumentation was stopped because of sudden bleeding in mesiolingual canal of mesial root. Stripping perforation of the mesial root was seen on the intraoral periapical radiograph [B]. The patient was immediately referred to the post-graduate section of the Endodontic Department. There, the instrumentation of the canals was continued using ProTaper Universal [Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland] in a crown down approach except in the mesiolingual canal to prevent increasing the size of perforation. One percent sodium hypochlorite [NaOCl] was used as irrigant during instrumentation. Because of persistent hemorrhage, a calcium hydroxide dressing was placed into the canals, and the tooth was temporary restored with Zonalin [Purton, Wiltshin, Sweden]. The patient was asymptomatic between appointments. At the subsequent visit 7 days later, the tooth was isolated, temporary restoration was removed, and the canals were thoroughly irrigated with 1% NaOCl. The canals were then gently dried and obturated with gutta-percha [Gapadent, Hamburg, Germany] and AH26 sealer [Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany] using lateral compaction method. The gutta-percha coronal to the perforation site in mesiolingual canal was removed. Root MTA [Salamifar, Tehran, Iran] was mixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and compacted into the coronal section of the canal and perforation site using Schilder plugger [Dentsply Caulk, Milford, USA] [C]. A wet cotton pellet was placed over the MTA, and the tooth was temporary restored using IRM [Dentsply, York, PA, USA]. After 48 hours, the temporary restoration and cotton pellet were removed, and the tooth was permanently restored with amalgam [Synalloy, Dentoria, France]. On 15-month recall, the patient had no signs or symptoms, and radiographic examination demonstrated complete resolution of furcal and periapical radiolucency [D]."
"A twenty-five years old woman, in the 24th week of gestation, presented with a voluminous cervical mass located on the left front neck. She had first noticed an enlargement of her neck 3 months earlier, and, apart from tiredness, she was completely asymptomatic.\nOn observation, she had an isolated cervical mass of about 5 × 10 cm long, hard on palpation, not mobile.\nFine needle aspiration showed a high grade B-cell lymphoma, CD10+ (flow cytometry), and the biopsy to the cervical lesion confirmed the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma with gene break point on MYC (8q24) determined by FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization). The tumour was CD20 (+), CD10 (+), Ki67 (+) (>90% of cells) (), CD3 (−), BCL2 (−), and TdT (−). The patient is HIV-1 negative, HIV-2 negative, EBV Ig G positive, and EBV Ig M negative.\nAs she was pregnant at the time of diagnosis, a total body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) was used for staging instead of conventional CT scan. MRI revealed a cervical mass of 104 × 63 × 75 mm deviating the trachea and oesophagus leftwards and in the infra diaphragmatic compartment, a mass measuring 135 × 116 × 94 mm in the right flank and a fetus of approximately 25 weeks (). There were no bone marrow infiltration and no central nervous system (CNS) infiltration, and the LDH level was elevated (1376 μL/L). According to the Murphy/St. Jude staging classification for Burkitt's lymphoma, the patient was in stage III. In an intention to safely carry on the pregnancy until week 28 of gestation, under monitoring by an obstetrician, chemotherapy with agents potentially less harmful for the baby was proposed. Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, plus rituximab (R-CHOP) was performed with reduction of the cervical mass; however, in two weeks' time, the mass started growing again and LDH increased. Delivery was performed at 28th week of gestation +5, and a healthy baby was born by caesarean section. After delivery, the patient proceeded with conventional treatment for BL according to LMB-96 protocol, group B [], without major complications.\nAssessment of treatment response after R-CYM (cytarabine, methotrexate, and rituximab) by CT and PET scan showed complete remission, and the patient completed chemotherapy according to LMB96 group B protocol in August 2012, with persisting complete remission."
"A 25-year-old fit and well male sustained a left complete ACL rupture in August 2001 due to a rotational soccer injury. This was confirmed at subsequent arthroscopy, and after a course of physiotherapy and a period of nonoperative treatment he elected for a reconstruction. This procedure was performed 3 years after the initial injury in August 2004 using bone patellar tendon bone (BTB) without complication. 9 and 10 mm bone plugs were harvested and fixed in the femoral canal with two RIGIDFIX cross pins placed from the lateral side of the femur as per the standard operative technique. The tibia was fixed with a 20 mm × 9 mm metal interference screw. A concomitant posterior 1/3 tear of the medial meniscus was repaired at the time of operation with 2 Mitek bioabsorbable sutures.\nPostoperatively, the patient made a full recovery and returned to sporting activity at 6 months. Whilst on holiday in February 2008, the patient developed an acute collection on the medial side of his knee overlying the medial femoral condyle. This was incised and drained, and a 22 mm fragment consistent with the RIGIDFIX implant was retrieved. The fragment was retrieved intact and later fractured (Fig. ). The wound healed and was treated with antibiotics, although no evidence of infection was documented. The patient’s inflammatory markers were normal and at last follow-up there was no evidence of superficial or deep infection. The range of movement in the knee was 0°–120° and the ACL was stable based on the normal anterior drawer and Lachman tests.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) undertaken in October 2008 demonstrated an intact reconstructed ACL with a well-healed medial meniscus (Figs. , ).\nThe patient gave informed consent prior to being included in the study."
"A 25-year-old male patient with a 5-month history of aggravated vision through blurring in the right eye was admitted to the General Hospital of Jinan Military Area Command of Chinese PLA, Shandong, China, on October 10th, 2011. An examination revealed sight impairment (vision, right eye, 0.1; left eye, 1.2), a typical temporal hemianopsia of the right eye and locally decreased vision sensitivity of the superior nasal aspect of the left eye, without other positive neurological signs. The serum concentrations of PRL, GH, T3, T4 and TSH were all within normal limits. The patient underwent head computed tomography, which revealed a round, hyperdense mass without clear edges in the sellar and suprasellar regions that was closely associated with the bilateral vessels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lobulated, isointense mass wrapped around the anterior communicating artery complex in the sellar-suprasellar region on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) in the sagittal view. The tumor was isointense and slightly hyperintense in the sellar-suprasellar region in the coronal view. There was no clear border separating the tumor from the peripheral brain tissues. The tumor was also isointense on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). Tumor-enhanced scanning demonstrated heterogeneous contrast enhancement (). The preliminary diagnosis was of meningioma or pituitary tumor. A tumor resection was conducted using a right pterional approach under general anesthesia on October 15, 2011. Intraoperatively, the base of the tumor was located on the sellar diaphragm of the left anterior pituitary stalk. The tumor pushed the pituitary stalk to the right posterior region, ascended to the suprasellar region, crossed the optic chiasm, invaded the lamina terminalis cistern and wrapped the bilateral A1 segment and anterior communicating artery complex. In the opposite direction, the tumor crossed the saddle-back and reached the slope, showing no clear demarcation from the hypothalamus. Severe adhesion to each side of the optic nerve caused difficulty in the separation of the tissues. The tumor tissue was tough and had an abundant blood supply. A feeding artery was present from a branch of the internal carotid artery in the base of the tumor. A total disparting resection of the tumor was performed with emphasis on left optic neuroprotection under a high-power lens. Following tumor resection, the undamaged pituitary and pituitary stalk were identified; these had been pushed towards the right posterior hypophyseal fossa by the tumor. The patient had no post-operative diabetes insipidus or idiopathic pituitary hypofunction, but had a right eye vision of 0.2, uncorrected and 1.0, corrected. The pathological diagnosis was of a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)."
"The case was a 25-year-old woman. She was a nursery teacher and routinely washed her hands many times daily. She had no previous medical history and was taking no medications or dietary supplements. Her left thumb had an ingrown nail, but she had not had it examined in a clinic, since it showed no troublesome symptoms. However, after her ingrown nail became infected, it presented with pain, swelling, and discharge of pus. Those symptoms continued for a month, after which the nail fell off the nail bed. She went to a clinic to have her left thumbnail examined at that time, but underwent observation rather than receiving treatment due to the expectation that it would spontaneously regenerate. No further infections flared up, but no regrowth of her left thumbnail was seen in four months.\nAt her first visit to our hospital, five months after the nail loss, her left thumbnail was absent and the nail bed was entirely exposed (). We continued to observe it without treatment for the next six months; however, it showed no tendency toward regrowth. Her left thumbnail had thus shown no significant changes after 10 months of observation: the nail bed was still naked and showed no signs that it would regenerate ().\nWe therefore prescribed external application of bFGF recombinant and antibiotic ointment: five applications of the bFGF spray to both the nail bed and the nail matrix once a day, and application of the ointment on the same site twice daily to ensure that it did not dry out. One month after beginning the treatment, nail regrowth was observed up to the halfway point of the nail bed (). After three months of the same treatment, the regrown nail reached the top of the nail bed, and there was no visible difference between her two thumbnails ()."
"A 25-year-old Turkish man who had been followed for one year with a diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome was admitted to the rheumatology clinic with fever up to 40°C and abdominal pain. On admission, his body temperature was 39°C. Physical examination revealed prominent superficial collateral veins in the chest wall and scars of old ulcers in the scrotum and also papulopustular lesions in the extremities and neck.\nLaboratory tests on admission revealed WBC of 6.6 × 109/L, hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dL, ESR of 36 mm/h, and CRP concentration of 43.5 mg/dL. Urinalysis, kidney, and liver functions were normal. Microbiologic studies were found negative. Autoimmune serologic tests were negative. He was started on tazocin (piperacillin and tazobactam) and clarithromycin as empiric antibiotherapy, but fever persisted under this therapy.\nTransthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed a mobile mass (4.5 × 3 cm in size) filling half of the right atrium and extending into the right ventricle and inferior vena cava (). Pulmonary arterial pressure by echocardiography was 30 mmHg.\nContrast-enhanced CT angiography confirmed the thrombus in the right atrium that extended into the right ventricle and displayed findings of both chronic and superimposed acute thromboembolism (Figures and ). The right ventricle showed signs of pulmonary hypertension including chamber dilatation, myocardial thickening, and straightening of the interventricular septum.\nMedical history revealed complaints of recurrent oral and genital ulcers and papulopustular lesions. HLA-B51 was positive. Pathergy test was negative. The patient was diagnosed with BD based on these findings. Hereditary thrombotic risk factors including prothrombin gene 20210G-A, factor V Leiden and MTHFR gene mutations were negative.\nThe patient was given methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/d) and monthly cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 for a day). Oral anticoagulant was stopped, and low molecular weighted heparin was started. Clinical findings regressed and laboratory abnormalities returned to normal. Six months later, the ICT was decreased substantially in size. The patient was continued to be treated with monthly cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and colchicine, without recurrence."
"A 25-year-old male was admitted to the General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command on June 15, 2000, due to a gradually increasing, severe pain in the left knee that had lasted for one month. X-ray imaging () showed osteoblastic destruction of the left distal femur, partial osteolytic changes, a visible periosteal reaction and a soft tissue mass. MRI () showed a mixed high and low signal intensity in the left distal femur, which formed a large soft tissue mass. The patient was finally diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left distal femur by biopsy and was administered two courses of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) and one course of ADR and DDP at the same dosage as previously reported (HDMTX, 10 g/m2; ADR, 60 mg/m2; and DDP, 120 mg/m2) (). On August 16, 2000, the patient received an en bloc resection of the left distal femoral osteosarcoma and an allograft bone transplantation. The incision healed well. The same regimen as used in the pre-operative chemotherapy was applied post-operatively. One year after the surgery, the patient’s left knee was able to achieve 90 degrees of flexion. However, at six years post-surgery, the patient felt pain in the affected limb, which was now shortened and causing a limp. At eight years post-surgery, the patient had difficulty walking, felt exacerbated pain and the affected limb was shortened by 12 cm. A diagnosis of bone resorption following allograft bone transplantation was determined (). In December 2009, the patient underwent a resection of the allograft bone and a reconstruction using a tumor prosthesis. Three months after the second surgery, the affected knee was able to achieve 45 degrees of flexion. In August 2010, X-ray imaging revealed a tumor shadow between the prosthesis and the host bone in the middle of the right femur, which was gradually increasing in size (). In August 2011, the affected leg was amputated and the osteosarcoma was confirmed by a post-operative pathological examination. The patient was then provided with four courses of chemotherapy consisting of ADR, DDP and IFO (identical doses to previously). There were no recurrences or distant metastases within 10 months following the third surgery. The patient is currently being monitored using follow-up appointments."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department after falling off his bicycle. He was hit by the bicycle's handle bar into the left side of the abdomen. The clinical examination revealed a fit young man who had only a scratch (abrasion) on the abdominal wall left of the umbilicus. Hemodynamically he was normal and alert and referred to intense pain at the abrasion site. The abdomen was soft, without signs of peritoneal irritation while sensitivity was only at the point of the abrasion. Laboratory tests, including white blood cells, liver enzymes, and amylase, were normal. The abdominal X-ray in upright (standing) position did not reveal the presence of free intraperitoneal air. Abdominal ultrasound did not reveal any solid abdominal organ injury nor the presence of free intraperitoneal fluid. The pain was attributed to hematoma of the rectus abdominis muscle pricey below the abrasion which was revealed by ultrasound.\nThe pain of the young man was gradually worsening and was mostly described diffusely throughout the whole abdomen. The abdomen remained soft and tender without signs of peritoneal irritation. We proceeded to the administration of per os contrast material and CT abdomen. The CT scan revealed the presence of sufficient amount of free intraperitoneal contrast but did not allow the clarification of the exact point of escape. The free contrast material was detected at the left side of the abdomen, at the area of the descending colon but mainly in the pelvis (). The intraluminal contrast had even reached up the level of the transverse colon.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy immediately after the CT scan (4 hours after the arrival at the emergency department and about 4.5 hours after the time of injury). Intraoperatively, fecal peritonitis due to isolated rupture of jejunum 30 cm from the ligament of Treitz was revealed. The rupture was at the center of an extensive jejunum serous layer fissure giving the picture of “blow out” perforation. At the jejunal mesentery there was minimal bruising. Multiple washings of the peritoneal cavity were performed with normal saline, and the restoration of jejunal injury was done with partial resection and end-to-end anastomosis ().\nThe postoperative course of the patient was uncomplicated, and he was discharged on the 6th postoperative day. 9 days later he returned with clinical and radiological signs of ileus that led us to the operating room 48 hours later due to deterioration of his clinical picture. The cause of the ileum was adhesions, so we proceeded to lysis of adhesions. The anastomosis was normal without leakage. Five days later the patient was discharged, and a year later he is still free of symptoms."
"This case report describes a 25-year-old Hispanic woman, without significant past medical history, who presented with progressive jaundice, associated with right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, weakness, dark urine, without acholia, fever, or vomiting. On physical examination, the patient had icteric sclerae, no hepatomegaly and no stigmata of chronic liver disease. The laboratory results are shown in Table . The results of ultrasonography of the liver and biliary tract were normal.\nWith the clinical and laboratory diagnosis, a preliminary diagnostic approach to acute hepatitis of unclarified etiology was established. We performed a percutaneous liver biopsy guided by ultrasound, which showed portal inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils, with necrosis of the hepatocytes of the limiting plate, and macrophage infiltrate composed of epithelioid granulomas, forming a non-necrotizing aspect in the hepatic sinusoids (Figures and ). Special stains for tuberculosis and fungi were negative. Contrasted computed tomography of the chest and abdomen were normal, ruling out sarcoidosis. The patient had a favorable outcome, with gradual improvement of her liver biochemical profile, without any specific treatment. At this point, we considered the possibility of drug-related granulomatous hepatitis. A more detailed questioning revealed that 2 weeks before the jaundice, the patient had received empirical treatment with albendazole and paracetamol and hyoscine butyl bromide for nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. The stool specimen was normal.\nThe self-limiting condition, as well as the gradual normalization in her liver profile, supported the possibility of toxic hepatitis. Patient monitoring without any intervention was decided. Table shows some of the follow-up analysis after 2 and 6 months. The results demonstrated spontaneous resolution of toxic granulomatous hepatitis."
"A 25-year-old male patient from Agaro District, Jimma Zone, Ethiopia started to have small itchy red skin lesion below the left eye lid. Within 5 days the swelling progressed to involve the upper lid, cheek and lips on the left side associated with dark ulceration over the swelling on both eyelids as shown in Figure . There was no history of trauma or surgery but there was a history of direct contact with sick ox while giving medicine 1 week prior to the onset of his illness.\nOn examination, he had diffuse edema on the left upper lid, lower lid and left part of the face with dark ulcer on the upper and lower lids. Visual acuity and other ocular examination were difficult initially. The temperature was 38.8°C. He took Augmentin 625 mg PO TID for 24 hours prior to presentation. The patient was admitted and started on intravenous ceftriaxone 1 gm BID and cloxacilline 500 mg QID. After 2 days there was mild decrement of the edema and the skin lesion became more discernable, thus doxycycline 100 mg PO BID was given. Black eschar began to form subsequently with resolution of the edema as seen in Figure . After 1 month of treatment, there was inter-palpebral height shortening with scarring resulting in difficulty of opening the eye lids. Mild ectropion on the lower eye lid was also present. The patient will be followed until the scar is stabilized enough to do skin graft."
"A 25 year-old nulliparous woman was addressed to our center, Hôtel Dieu de France University Hospital, few weeks after being operated by laparoscopy of an 11 cm ruptured left adnexal cystic mass on May 2010. Pathology results showed an endometrioid grade I ovarian adenocarcinoma.\nShe was subsequently scheduled for a conservative surgery that included a total abdominopelvic exploration, left adnexectomy, peritoneal washings, random biopsies, infra-gastric omentectomy, resection of trocars insertion sites and bilateral ilio-obturator as well as para-aortic lymph node dissection reaching the left renal vein. An endometrial curettage was also carried out and later showed a well-differenciated endometrioid adenocarcinoma with complex hyperplasia. A frozen section at the time of surgery confirmed the absence of residual proliferating or viable tumoral cells in the left ovary with only necrotic granulomatous material left. Peritoneal cytology, omentectomy, lymph nodes (26 pelvic and 17 para-aortic) and trocar insertion sites were all negative for malignancy.\nA month later, hysteroscopy with total surgical endometrectomy confirmed the total absence of myometrial involvement as the results came back with only complex hyperplasia with atypia. The patient went on and received six courses of carboplatin plus cyclophosphamide combined with six months of megestrol acetate and leuprolide acetate.\nHistological controls, six months then a year later, obtained by hysteroscopy demonstrated the absence of residual hyperplasia, atypia or malignancy. She resumed menses after stopping megestrol and leuprolide.\nShe was scheduled for a control in May 2012 for a hysteroscopic control, but she turned out to be pregnant. She was followed up by sonograms during her pregnancy in order to rule out any recurrence. She had a normal delivery in Paris, on February 2013. Actually the patient is doing well with no evidence of disease."
"A 25-year-old man presented to our facility of difficult wounds one month after the accident with a skin lesion on the anterior region of the left arm with extensive necrosis of skin and subcutaneous plants involving the underlying muscle planes, caused by a trauma due to a car accident ().\nHe was previously evaluated by the emergency, orthopedics, and vascular surgery departments of his city. The reports referred lacerated-contused with multiple massive loss of substance, probably torn tendon and vascular damage. The main lesion was clearly visible; it covered the entire anterolateral left arm and was infected.\nThe wound size was 40 × 15 cm; it had a sanious, fibrinous, secreting, and smelly bottom. A buffer was performed; it resulted positive for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and then an antibiotic therapy was prescribed based on fluoroquinolone cps. 500 mg, 2 cp./die for two weeks.\nThe patient was treated at our facility of difficult wounds, Department of Plastic, Reconstructive, and Aesthetic Surgery in Rome over a period of three months. In this period, we performed daily dressings before debridement of the lesion through a collagenase plus hyaluronic acid ointment: Bionect Start (Fidia Pharmaceutical, Abano Terme, Italy). Each dressing consisted of four phases: disinfection with sodium hypochlorite 0.05% (Amukine Med 0,05%, Amuchina S.p.A., Genova) and povidone-iodine solution 10% (Betadine, Meda Pharma S.p.A, Milano), cleansing with saline solution, applying a layer of 2 mm ointment, and cover with a premedicated patch. After the first week, a considerable reduction of exudate, fibrin, pain, and smell was observed. An initial onset of granulation was already evident.\nAfter two months of dressings, we obtained the increase of the granulation with reduction of wound's depth from the bottom and the start of reepithelialization from the margins ().\nAfter three months, we obtained a complete healing ()."
"A 25-year-old woman sustained severe flame burns on the neck and chest (Figure 4). Emergency split-thickness skin grafts were applied, but neck scar contractures developed postoperatively. Both shoulders had not sustained burns, so neck reconstruction using a bilateral supraclavicular flaps measuring 17 x 9 cm, and 15 x 8 cm was designed. The flaps were elevated as skin pedicle flaps, and transferred to cover the defect after removal of the scar. They survived completely, and the functional and aesthetic results were good, although a scar band remained on the left neck. We are planning to remove this in the near future. The donor sites have been closed primarily."
"A 25-year-old male was admitted to Gifu University Hospital (Gifu, Japan) with a two-week history of diarrhea and abdominal pain. The results of routine laboratory tests were all within the normal range. However, an abdominal ultrasound revealed a mass in the pancreatic head, which was composed of high-echoic central and low-echoic peripheral areas. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging identified the nodule to be predominantly solid and ~28 mm in maximal diameter. The cytological smear and cell block of the sample that was obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) revealed the presence of uniformly monomorphic tumor cells, several layers of which covered the central fibrovascular stalks and formed papillary-like structures (). The patient underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy. The histological examination demonstrated that the tumor exhibited a solid pattern as a whole with no cystic change, comprising of sheets and cords of oval-to-round monomorphic cells with cytoplasmic vacuolization in certain areas (). A fibrous area was observed at the center of the tumor, which may have been generated by the preceding needle aspiration. An immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor cells were positive for neuron specific enolase (NSE), CD56, chromogranin, synaptophysin, β-catenin and CD10 and negative for trypsin ()."
"A 25-year-old male prisoner with a 3-day history of right lumbar pain presented to our clinic. Kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) X-ray, ultrasonography, and CT scan revealed a 1.5 cm right proximal ureteral stone with hydronephrosis. Renal laboratory parameters and urinalysis were normal. We performed a right ureterorenoscopy but were unable to perform lithotripsy due to ureteral edema and an impacted stone. We simultaneously placed a double J stent during KUB X-ray (). He was then referred to an education and research hospital for ESWL.\nHe presented to our emergency department with a sudden, painless, and total incontinence two days after the first ESWL session and was referred to our urology department. He said that he had no problems after his ESWL session until he noticed that his underwear was wet. He changed his underwear but continued to experience incontinence during the day.\nThe patient had an unremarkable medical history and used anti-inflammatory drugs for renal stones. He experienced anxiety, excitement, and embarrassment because he lived in a jail cell with other prisoners. His vital signs were stable and he did not have abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness upon physical examination. There were no genital abnormalities. Urinalysis and a KUB X-ray study were performed, which demonstrated that the double J stent had migrated into the urethra (). To our knowledge, the patient's total incontinence was the result of the stent bypassing the urethral sphincteric mechanism.\nThe stent was found in the membranous urethra and was removed cystoscopically under local anesthesia. His incontinence remitted immediately after the stent was removed. We suggested that he continue with ESWL, but he was lost to follow-up. This is the first case of sudden total incontinence due to migrated ureteral double J stent through the external urethral sphincter into the urethra following ESWL."
"Case 3: A 25 year-old male involved in homosexual activity with multiple partners, was admitted with the symptoms suggestive of pneumonia. He denied other high-risk behavior activity namely intravenous drug use and contact with person with tuberculosis.\nOn examination, he was febrile, hypotensive and tachypneic. The patient was dehydrated and looked cachexic. Oral candidiasis was seen. Lung examination noted presence of bibasal crepitations. There were lymphadenopathies at cervical and inguinal regions. His other systems were found to be normal.\nEmpirical treatment for tuberculosis was initiated after the microscopic examination of the sputum sample showing positive for acid-fast bacilli. Later, his sputum culture confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The treatment for tuberculosis was continued at standard dosages. In view of his high-risk behavior, several serological tests were done which included HIV and syphilis. His HIV test result was positive. RPR was also reactive with titer of 1:2. Both Syphilis IgM and IgG were positive, confirmed syphilis infection too. He was given intramuscular Benzathine penicillin 2.4 mega units weekly for three dosages. The repeated RPR titer after 15 months was 1:1. The repeated Syphilis IgM and IgG serology tests were negative."
"A twenty-five year-old-male patient came to the dental clinics for routine dental care. His chief complaint was to remove and/or minimize the noticeable brown/yellow staining of his teeth. He wanted the least invasive and most cost-effective treatment to change his smile. A review of his medical history and past dental history revealed no contraindications to dental treatment. In consideration of his age, the patient was not interested in treatment options that involved significant removal of tooth structure, such as porcelain or composite resin veneers. From the appearance of his teeth, a diagnosis of mild fluorosis staining determined by using Dean's Fluorosis Index () was sent on the anterior teeth in the aesthetic zone, with the most significant staining occurring on the maxillary anterior teeth, with light brown streaks in the middle third of the facial surfaces ().\nA treatment plan was presented to the patient that would fulfill his request for minimally invasive treatment which proposed microabrasion of the superficial enamel. Upon completion of treatment, the tooth shade would be evaluated.\nThe teeth was isolated with a rubber dam to protect the gums from coming into contact with the acid (18% HCl). The pumice-acid slurry is then applied to the tooth or teeth to the facial surfaces of the maxillary teeth using cotton () and rubbed either manually or with a very slow speed rubber cup. Using a right angle latch type slow-speed handpiece running the motor at 1,000 rpm, a hybrid bristle brush-cup was used to rub the pumice acid slurry for three separate applications of 30 to 40 seconds each. Between each application, the slurry was rinsed and dried from the tooth surfaces. This procedure was repeated three times. At the completion of the microabrasion technique, the enamel surfaces were polished with a cup-shaped porcelain polishing rubber abrasive to smooth and polish the enamel surface. After a few layers of enamel are removed, the slurry was rinsed with water and the result was evaluated. This process is repeated until the stain is gone or the process must be stopped for other reasons (enamel getting too thin or tooth getting sensitive). After the process was complete, fluoride gel was placed on the teeth in order to reduce postoperative sensitivity. The entire process takes less than an hour and is permanent. The rubber dam was removed and the patient viewed the result of treatment (). He was pleased with the result from the immediate removal of the dark staining on his maxillary anterior teeth."
"A 25-years-old moderate right-hemiplegic female chronic stroke survivor participated in the study. She suffered from a left-sided thalamic-capsular bleeding at the age of 16, due to a vascular malformation. A surgical intervention at the age of 17 stabilized her conditions. After 6 years, a right-hemiplegia with tingling and numbness due to the peri-lesional edema, probably caused by the intervention, occurred. She was admitted to the S.Camillo Hospital, for a short hospitalization period, where she underwent the BMI-training (see ) with both arms. Her disability was characterized by a limited right-arm and forearm control, right-hand grasping, external rotation, and a restricted volitional movement of the fingers (spasticity). However, she was able to use her right-hand or arm for some daily living activities (i.e., open a door, objects grasping), and was able to walk slowly without external aid. The chronic character of her impairment was assessed by multiple functional measurements after the surgical intervention (6, 3, and 1 months before inclusion in the present study). The following clinical tests were assessed 2 days before the experimental protocol: Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE, score 40/66), sensibility (S, score 21/24), Modified Ashworth Score (MAS, score 4, biceps brachii, pectoralis major, flexor carpi, flexor digitorum profundus, flexor digitorum superficialis were measured), Reaching Score (RS, score 21/36), and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT, score 5 p./50 s).\nThe standardized language test (Aachener Aphasie Test, AAT; token test score: eight minimal deficit; comprehension score: seven slight deficit) and cognitive assessment was carried out to ensure understanding capability and execution of the proposed task. The participant was recruited for the study because she was able to initiate and complete the target-reaching task of our protocol, albeit with limited performance (inclusion criteria). The unaffected arm was used as control since neither placebo control was possible nor different control conditions. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the S.Camillo Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from the participant according to the Declaration of Helsinki."
"We report a 25-year-old man who presented with episodic headache for 5 months. He was evaluated because of increasing frequency and severity of the headaches. He had no history of seizures or other significant event. His neurological examination was unremarkable. The patient underwent unenhanced CT of the brain. On CT, a large well defined homogeneous lesion was seen in the right sylvian fissure with attenuation characteristics of fat (-90 to -110 HU). Incomplete peripheral calcification was also seen. The lesion was surrounded by abnormally thick cortex along its medial border (). For better evaluation of the lesion, its enhancement pattern and associated cortical malformation, MR imaging was done. On MR, the lesion was hyperintense on both T1 and fast spin echo (FSE) T2-weighted images, and showed multiple flow voids ( and , respectively). A peripheral hypointense signal was seen corresponding to calcification as seen on CT image. The overlying cortex was thickened with irregular margins. On post contrast fat suppressed T1-weighted images, marked suppression of signal intensity of the lesion was seen consistent with lipoma along with enhancing vasculature within the lesion with its extension to the hemispheric surface (). Based on the CT and MR features, the radiological diagnosis of sylvian fissure lipoma with abnormal vasculature and cortical dysplasia was kept. Cerebral angiography was not performed as surgery was not considered. The patient was managed conservatively on medication. Follow-up of patient with MR angiography is planned keeping the possibility of aneurysm formation in the lesion. As our lesion had high intrinsic T1 signal, phase contrast MRA, rather than TOF, would be done."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of our university hospital with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, slight mental disability, and abdominal pain. Cardiovascular, respiration, and gastrointestinal system examination findings were normal. The neurological examinations of the cranial nerves and limbs were normal. He was clinically dehydrated. On the first day of his admission, laboratory studies revealed a BUN level of 35 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.17 mg/dL, calcium level of 8.6 mg/dL, and moderate metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.30. The urinalysis showed hematuria [++++], leukocyturia [++], and proteinuria [+]. A lot of red blood cell casts and white blood cell casts with a few granular casts and epithelial cell casts were observed in urine sediment. Renal ultrasound showed normal sized kidneys with no hydronephrosis. The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) was 4%, and he was diagnosed with acute kidney failure. He was admitted to the nephrology department, and intravenous fluid therapy was started immediately due to his dehydration status. Kidney function tests and blood gases were monitored daily. His condition was stable until the 3rd day. On the 3rd day, anuria was developed, and his creatinine level increased to a level of 13,5 mg/dL and revealed a blood gas pH of 7.19 with high anion gap metabolic acidosis. He was admitted for urgent venovenous hemodialysis intervention for two hours via a jugular hemodialysis catheter. On the 4th day, a kidney biopsy was performed. On the 5th day, unilateral right peripheral nerve palsy developed abruptly (). His temporal computerized tomography scan was normal, and electromyography showed a lesion on the right facial nerve. There was no history of cold exposure, and diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, and neuropathic disorders were ruled out by the negative autoantibody screen, normal serum electrophoresis, and negative HIV test. On the 7th, day pathological examination of the kidney specimen revealed tubular injury with oxalate crystals (Figures and ). The patient was questioned again after obtaining the pathological biopsy result. He then confessed that he had drunk antifreeze solution in a suicide attempt one day before being admitted to hospital. Hemodialysis intervention was continued three times a week due to progressive deterioration of kidney functions. He was discharged from hospital two weeks later with a hemodialysis catheter and followed up weekly. Two months later, he was considered as having end stage renal failure and underwent routine hemodialysis intervention via a created arteriovenous fistula. On the followup, the patient's facial palsy had not regressed."
"A 25 year old man was admitted to otorhinolaryngology department with a mass in the ear canal. The patient had a history of tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy in another centre (for chronic otorrhea)\n2 years earlier. Details of the surgery were not available. He had no discharge during this time and he came to our hospital for routine follow-up visits. On otomicroscopy a white mass was noticed in the superior part of the canal, the origin of which could not exactly be localized. On palpation with a blunt instrument it proved to be soft. No otorrhea was noted in the canal and the tympanic membrane seemed to be intact in the visible area.\nThe most likely diagnosis was cholesteatoma recurrence but the chief differential diagnosis to be ruled out in such cases is meningocele and dural herniation.\nAn HRCT was ordered and the mass origin from attic was obvious. The intact tegmen tympani rules out intracranial involvement. The patient was operated and a rather extensive cholesteatoma was found and cleaned. It seems that he has had an attic cholesteatoma which went unnoticed and consequently unmanaged in the previous surgery and tympanoplasty had been done on the epidermal remnants in the attic."
"A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our otorhinolaryngology clinic at Quaem Hospital at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences with a complaint of a non-tender, rapidly growing mass first observed five weeks earlier on her right auricle. There were no other accompanying symptoms.\nOn physical examination, a 2 × cm mass lesion was observed on the right auricle attached to the concha. The mass was fragile and easily became bloody by manipulation. It was not possible to examine the external auditory canal (EAC) and tympanic membrane, but the lesion appeared to be discrete from the EAC. No cervical lymphadenopathies were detected. A thorough whole-body skin examination revealed no other lesions. With a pre-diagnosis of a pyogenic granuloma, and also to rule out the malignant lesions such as sarcoma, a punch biopsy was taken. At subsequent 1-week follow up, the lesion had grown to approximately 3 × 4.5 cm ().\nMicroscopic findings showed a proliferation of plump, mitotically active spindle-shaped cells with oval, pale-staining nuclei and short irregular bundles in a loosely mucoid matrix with extravasated red blood cells and multinucleated giant cells. An immunohisto- chemical (IHC) panel for cytokeratin (CK), S-100, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), smooth muscle actin (SMA), and vimentin (Vim) was performed. On IHC study, CK, EMA, and S-100 were negative, and SMA and Vim were expressed, which confirms the diagnosis of NF ().\nAccording to the pathologic diagnosis of nodular fasciitis, the patient underwent an excision of the lesion under general anesthesia. The basal skin of the lesion was completely excised and the surrounding skin was primarily repaired. There was no cartilage invasion. The permanent pathologic result was also compatible with nodular fasciitis. There was no recurrence after a year."
"A 25-year-old gentleman was referred with a difficulty in controling asthma. He had history of chronic rhinosinusitis, recurrent nasal eosinophilic polyps, and two previous polypectomies. Asthma was exacerbated by Ibuprofen in the past. He required two asthma exacerbation related hospital admissions in one year. Examination showed cushingoid feature and steroid related skin changes. Lung exam was significant for diffuse wheezing. No nasal polyps were evident on exam. Other systemic examinations were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was normal. Serum total IgE was 284 KU/L (normal 0–114). Blood eosinophils were 600. Skin prick test was positive for dog and horse hair and spirometry showed moderate reversible obstruction. Chest radiographs showed no abnormalities.\nHis asthma was categorized as moderate to severe with score of 10 on asthma control test (ACT). He was active smoker but managed to quit; however, this did not improve his asthma symptoms. We offered aspirin desensitization.\nA two-day aspirin (ASA) desensitization protocol was carried out using Stevenson and Simon regimen []. ASA challenge was performed in the first day as part of the desensitization regimen and the patient developed difficulty of breathing, wheezing, and drop in FEV1 by 30% confirming the presence of sensitization. Patient was successfully maintained on 600 mg ASA twice daily. Asthma symptoms improved remarkably and ACT score was 17 three weeks later. Prednisolone was successfully tapered to 10 mg. On day 26, patient developed generalized maculopapular erythematous itchy skin rash, progressing to nonblanching purpuric lesions. All work-up for systemic vasculitis was negative including immunological tests and a clinical diagnosis of aspirin induced cutaneous vasculitis was made without skin biopsy.\nAspirin was discontinued and the steroid dose was increased, leading to significant improvement in vasculitic rash. There were no new lesions over next 10 days. Montelukast was questioned as a cause of CV [] and discontinued. Then, corticosteroid dose was reduced while patient was off ASA to uncover any steroid suppressed primary vasculitis. At 10 mg prednisolone, the patient again developed vasculitic rash. Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of primary cutaneous vasculitis. It showed the presence of neutrophilic leukocytoclastic vasculitis. No granuloma, necrotizing vasculitis, or tissue eosinophilia could be found. No evidence of Churg-Strauss syndrome clinically or histologically. Patient was started on colchicine that resulted in CV resolution."
"A 25 year-old male motorcyclist had sustained multiple injuries in a road traffic accident including closed fracture of left femoral shaft and lateral condyle and head trauma 1.5 months before recent admission to our hospital. The fracture had been initially treated with an Ilizarov apparatus; however, recently he underwent bleeding around the left lateral femoral surgical incision and was thus referred to our hospital (). On arrival, he was hypotensive and had tachycardia. On the examination, his left limb was found atrophic and a 35 cm incision of an orthopedic procedure was lateral to the femur (from proximal toward distal) with granulation tissue and blood oozing out of it with no trill or bruit. Motor examination of fingers and ankle showed impaired dorsiflexion; however the distal pulses in the leg were normal. After stablization of hemodynamic status, exploration of the wound revealed a large hematoma with a bleeding spot from an injured branch of DFA (lateral circumflex femoral artery) and a false aneurysm at that site with communication to DFA. The hematoma was evacuated and the injured branch of deep femoral artery was ligated and bleeding ceased. Ten days after the surgery the patient bled again around his left femur and after performing a contrast-enhanced angiography (), in classic exploration (medial approach) of common and deep femoral arteries bleeding from the same branch of DFA was seen. We ligated the injured branch at the point of its communication with DFA where it had originated (). The patient had good recovery without further bleeding episodes."
"A 25 year-old young man was injured in a motor vehicle accident (inability to control the vehicle due to violation of the speed limit). When his car reached the U-turn, it slid off the road and flipped over. Possible mechanism of injury was dorsiflexion pronation of the left side and dorsiflexion supination of the right side. The patient was brought in conscious and hemodynamically stable at the time of admission; he presented with severe bilateral ankle swelling, numerous bilateral ecchymoses and blisters without any open wounds. On physical exam, toe circulation was mildly delayed but the extremities were warm and no evidence of ischemia could be found. In the systemic review, no serious head, spinal or abdominal trauma requiring emergent measures could be noted. Ankle and plantar radiographs were obtained which demonstrated left ankle Hawkin type 4 open talar neck fracture with subtalar and talonavicular dislocation and a 3 cm open wound (). On the right side, Hawkin type 4 open and comminuted fracture of the right talar body and lateral process with subtalar and talonavicular dislocation, and 3 cm open wound was noted (, ). In spinal radiography there were T10 and T11 vertebral body fractures.\nIn the right lower extremity, multiple fragmented talar body fracture and posterior medial tubercle were opened via an anteromedial approach. Chevron osteotomy of the medial malleolus was performed. After intraarticular irrigation and minimal soft tissue manipulation, reduction was performed by three partial thread cannulated and cancellous screws (4 mm). Consequent intraarticular irrigation was performed and the location of malleolar osteotomy was fixed by 2 malleolar pins (). In the left extremity, the talus neck fracture with medial wall comminution and lateral malleolar tip avulsion was opened by simultaneous anteromedial and lateral approach for a better view, after which intraarticular irrigation and debridement took place. Neck reduction was performed using 2 cannulated cancellous screws (4 mm), and lateral Malleolus fracture was fixed using two pins(number 1.1) (). Antibiotic prophylaxis was continued up to 48 hours after the operation. The patient was discharged with short splints on both lower extremities without any wound complications. The patient’s condition after 2 years follow up was 20 degrees plantar flexion, zero dorsiflexion with moderate pain and AVN and collapse in talar body on the right side. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score was 58/7 and 40 degrees plantar flexion 20 dorsiflexion no pains no AVN on the left side. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score was 82/7 (). The patient`s quality of life was good based on the SF-36 score."
"A 25-year-old Japanese woman complained of abdominal bloating and received a living donor (her mother) kidney transplant for chronic renal failure due to renal hypoplasia when she was 13 years old. A pelvic CT scan revealed a 120 × 115 × 125 mm mass (A). The tumor markers were as follows: cancer antigen (CA)-125, 51 U/mL; CA-72-4, 4.6 U/mL; and squamous cell carcinoma antigen,2.0 ng/mL. Laparotomy was performed. It revealed that the patient's right ovary was increased in size, although her uterus, fallopian tubes, and left ovary had normal appearances. Right salpingo-oophorectomy and harvest of ascites was performed. We considered that there was no gross residual disease. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and the final pathology report indicated neuroblastoma arising from a mature cystic teratoma (C,D). Postoperative bone scintigraphy was performed. It revealed no bone metastasis. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected postoperatively. These samples showed that the urinary excretion concentrations of VMA and HVA were normal. Ascites cytology was negative. Thus, we diagnosed International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage 1C(b) because of intraoperative microrupture due to adhesion. Therefore, we administered adjuvant chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin. Dose reductions were necessary to protect renal function. Thus, we decreased the etoposide dose by 25% (75 mg/m2 on days 1–5) and cisplatin by 50% (10 mg/m2on days 1–5) every 3 weeks. Her renal function was good, and we used G-CSF to treat grade2 myelosuppression. She remained in good health with no evidence of recurrence for 6 months after 6 courses of chemotherapy."
"The 1st Case. A 25-year-old, female, African Brazilian arrived at the emergency service referring abdominal pain of high intensity, starting 15 days ago. The pain was accompanied by fever, vomits, and one episode of diarrhea. The patient was HIV positive, in regular use of antiretroviral (ART) for the past 2 years, and had a previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis.\nAt physical examination, the patient was mildly pale, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 ipm, and blood pressure of 110 × 80 mmHg. The abdomen was painful at palpation, especially in the right hipocondrium, but showed no signs of peritonitis (i.e., tenderness to palpation or increased abdominal wall rigidity). Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly with thrombosis and partial dilation of the distal part of the splenic vein. There was also a notable enlargement of the peripancreatic, periaortic, and intrahaortic lymph nodes.\nEUS was performed using a sectorial probe of 7.5 MHz. It showed multiple round, hypoecogenic, homogeneous lymph nodes, the larger ones with a diameter of 1.5 cm, localized in the hepatic and splenic hilum and peripancreatic region. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed in the peripancreatic lymph node using a 22-gauge needle. The aspirate was smeared onto a slide and the remaining material in the syringe was rinsed in formaldehyde and sent to the lab for cell block production (centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes with 20 mL of agar gel, followed by paraffin embedding of the pellet). Cytopathological analysis of the smear was mainly necrotic and inconclusive due to the lack of viable cells in the sample, but the cell block showed small fragments of tissue, with formation of structures suggestive of granulomas, amidst in necrosis. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain showed acid-fast bacilli (Figures and ), and the final diagnosis was nodal mycobacteriosis."
"A Twenty-five-year-old male reported cleaning his injured left knee with a brush usually used to clean the aquarium, which resulted in infiltration and subsequently visible crusts together with two subcutaneous resistances caused by M. marinum. The patient was initially treated with clarithromycin. Subcutaneous resistance did not lessen after nine weeks; therefore, treatment was continued with ethambutol for an additional nine weeks."
"A 25-year-old primiparous woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus presented at 34 weeks' gestation with preeclampsia, for which she was given steroids. Emergency Caesarean section was undertaken at 35 weeks for preeclamptic toxaemia, following which she was discharged home on day 4. She was readmitted 2 days later with dyspnoea and orthopnoea. Initial differential diagnoses were panic attack and pulmonary thromboembolism. The diagnosis of decompensated HF was only made following a chest X-ray showing pulmonary oedema.\nShe was intubated and transferred to the National Heart Failure Unit. She was supported by an intra-aortic balloon pump, which was successfully weaned after 5 days. Her follow up echocardiogram showed good ventricular functions. She remains well to date on beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor, and aldosterone antagonist. She also had a trial of bromocriptine for three months."
"A twenty-five-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of right shoulder pain. Initial plain films demonstrated a pathological fracture of the proximal humerus. Systemic staging confirmed metastatic disease of the lung, spine, sacrum, and femurs. A biopsy sample from the proximal humerus lesion was obtained. The histology and IHC analysis confirmed the diagnosis of EWS. The patient subsequently received neoadjuvant treatment consisting of four monthly rounds of vincristine, adrinomycin and cyclophosphimide that were well tolerated, along with external beam radiation to right proximal humerus and sacrum. Follow-up CT chest during the course of treatment showed mixed interval response. Four months after diagnosis, the patient presented with neck pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass compressing the spinal cord at the level of C2. Subsequently, he underwent an urgent cervical spine laminectomy, decompression, and fusion. The histology and IHC analysis performed on the c-spine lesion confirmed EWS. Six months after diagnosis, CT chest detected enlarging pulmonary masses and bilateral chest tubes were placed to treat the pulmonary edema. Despite conventional treatment, patient succumbed to the disease 6 months after diagnosis."
"A 25-year-old male patient with a noncontributory medical history reported to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology with the chief complaint of multiple swellings on left side of face and inside the mouth. The swellings were not associated with any pain and had gradually increased to the present status. A similar swelling was revealed on the back of his father.\nExtraoral examination revealed no significant facial asymmetry. The swelling was poorly defined and had increased in size in a dependent position. On palpation, it was soft in consistency and was easily compressible but lacked prominent pulsation. Intraoral examination revealed swelling with bluish discoloration in floor of the mouth with intact overlying mucosa (). The swelling was soft in consistency and nontender on palpation, readily blanched with compression, and lacked a prominent pulsation. The swelling extended from the left mandibular central incisor anteriorly to the third molar region posteriorly. Bluish discoloration was also seen in the lower labial vestibule in relation to left lateral incisor and left canine and in the left buccal mucosa with respect to left first and second maxillary molars.\nBlood was examined for routine investigations and all the values were found to be normal. Plain radiographs revealed no bony involvement, but phleboliths were noticed (). MRI revealed hyperintense T2-weighted images with no flow voids (). Biopsy was performed and on histopathological examination it revealed the presence of large cavernous spaces lined by endothelial cells. These spaces were filled with blood and supported by fibrous connective tissue stroma ().\nMRI impression and histopathological findings revealed the diagnosis of arteriovenous malformation involving base of tongue."
"The second patient was a 25-year-old woman whose marriage date was 8 years ago. She suffered from infertility with unknown cause. Hormonal and diagnostic tests were normal. Due to sever generalized anxiety disorder and major depression disorder observed by her obstetrician, she was referred to psychologist. She had severed depression with depressed appearance, irritability, continuous crying, helplessness, insomnia and loss of communication. She became candidate to participate at group psychotherapy sessions. Due to sever anxiety and depression observed by psychologist (according to the DSM IV-TR criteria), in the first session she received personal counseling. Then, she participated at group psychotherapy sessions continuously. Total score of the DASS-21 scale was 41 (depression= 12, anxiety= 15, stress = 14) and when finished the psychiatric approach the total score decreased to 30 (depression = 8, anxiety = 12, stress = 10). The PSWQ score also decreased from 18 on pre-test to 11 on post-test. Five months after completing group psychotherapy sessions she became pregnant."
"A 25 year old woman with primary infertility who has regular menstruation and the menarche was at 12 years. Mantoux test was positive as 40 mm and chest X-ray revealed bilateral hilar calcifications. HSG showed normal cervix with irregular uterine cavity and clover leaf appearance which suppose uterine cavity adhesions.\nFallopian tubes had irregular border with beading appearance, contrast medium passage was not detected in pelvic cavity but venous extravasations was seen (). Hysteroscopy findings show moderate to severe adhesions in uterine cavity. Menstrual blood smear was positive for acid fast bacillus and multidrug treatment was prescribed."
"A 25-year-old female with no history of cardiovascular disease was admitted with severe cardiogenic shock and decompensated heart failure after a week of fever, myalgia, nausea and vomiting (Table ). Blood results demonstrated multi-organ failure and elevated lactate levels. Echocardiography demonstrated biventricular dilatation with severely impaired contractility and presence of a right ventricular (RV) intracavitary thrombus. Cardiogenic shock was refractory to optimal medical treatment (high-dose inotropes) and her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. The patient had an INTERMACS profile 1 as defined []. Based on the clinical presentation, acute myocarditis was suspected as being a potentially reversible underlying cause. Therefore circulatory support using VA-ECMO was initiated. Subsequently, the diagnosis of acute myocarditis could be confirmed by RV endomyocardial biopsies showing extensive lymphocytic myocardial infiltration and evidence of recent Influenza A and parvo virus B19 infection. During VA-ECMO therapy, alongside low-dose enoximone, we gradually introduced bisoprolol and ramipril at low dosages. The patient improved clinically and her renal function and liver enzymes normalised. After 7 days of mechanical support, ECMO could be weaned. The clinical course was complicated by 3rd degree AV block necessitating DDD-pacemaker implantation. The patient’s further recovery was uneventful under standard heart failure therapy. Enoximone could be stopped after 16 days, and she was discharged after 36 days of hospital admission. Regular follow-up echocardiograms showed an improvement in cardiac function. At 3.5 years of follow-up, she remains fully asymptomatic with only mildly depressed LV function with estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 40–45 %, normal LV dimensions (LVEDD 48 mm) and normal LV filling pressures (E/E’ 8)."
"A 25-year-old female was referred to the department of endodontics, Zahedan Dental University. The patient’s chief complaint was a fractured amalgam restoration on the mandibular right second premolar, i.e. tooth #45 (). The medical history was noncontributory. Clinical examination revealed a defective amalgam filling with missing coronal seal in the right mandibular second premolar and first molar (#45 and #46). The tooth #45 was mildly tender to percussion. Preoperative radiograph showed incomplete and poor obturation of the canal in the premolar tooth. A diagnosis of chronic apical periodontitis was made and endodontic retreatment was planned for tooth #45. The patient was encouraged to seek for endodontic retreatment of the adjacent molar, as well.\nAfter administration of the local anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with 1:80000 epinephrine (Daroupakhsh, Tehran, Iran), the tooth #45 was accessed under rubber dam isolation. Sizes 3 to 1 of Gates Glidden drills (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues, USA) were used in a crown-down fashion to enlarge the orifices with a brushing motion. The existing root filling was removed with solvent, hand and rotary files. After determination of the working length with an apex locator device (iPex, NSK, Tochigi, Japan) and its radiographic confirmation (), the canals were cleaned and shaped with ProTaper files (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues, USA) supplemented with alternate 2.5% sodium hypochlorite irrigation.\nPatency was achieved in all the canals and was maintained with #10 K-file (Dentsply, Maillefer, USA). After drying the canals with paper points, the master gutta-percha points were fit within the canals and confirmation radiography was taken. Canals were obturated with cold lateral compaction of gutta-percha and AH-26 sealer (Dentsply, Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK, USA) (). The access cavity was filled with amalgam. The 6-month follow-up radiography revealed healing of the periapical radiolucent lesion around tooth #45 ()."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian male patient presented with a three-week history of a red right eye. He complained of blurred vision on the affected eye without pain or other sensations. He had no fever, fatigue, and denied weight loss. His past medical and family history were unremarkable.\nOn examination, the patient's visual acuity was 14/20 OD and 20/20 OS. A prominent vascularized iris lesion located at 7 o'clock was present in the right eye in addition to mutton-fat keratic precipitates, predominantly in Arlt's triangle, anterior chamber cells, and mixed conjunctival and ciliary injection (). Neither fundoscopy of the right eye nor examination of the left eye disclosed any pathological findings.\nAn ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) of the right eye revealed a prominent iris process with extension into ciliary body which measured 4.7 × 4.0 × 1.8 mm with middle internal reflectivity ().\nLaboratory findings were unremarkable including serum ACE level and tuberculin testing. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular parenchymal involvement.\nTo confirm the suggested diagnosis of sarcoidosis, conjunctival biopsy was performed. Histopathological work-up showed granulomatous epithelioid cell inflammation with insular central necrosis without acid-fast bacilli (Figures and ). The diagnosis of tuberculosis was suspected and further examinations were initiated.\nExtensive systemic checkup, including bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with CD4/CD8 ratio evaluation, and transbronchial biopsy, revealed no evidence of acid-fast organisms. Transbronchial biopsy showed noncaseating granulomatous inflammation, typical for sarcoidosis. PCR showed no mycobacterial DNA in the biopsy specimen.\nSystemic and topical steroid therapy was initiated with oral prednisolone 100 mg daily and prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops hourly. Under this treatment our patient recovered completely. Eight weeks after the first presentation, no signs of intraocular inflammation were detectable, the iris tumor resolved completely, and the patient was free of any complaints."
Case 1 was a 25-year-old male patient with nodulocystic acne who was consulted from dermatology outpatient clinic before initiation of oral isotretinoin treatment. He has been using contact lenses (Acuvue Oasys with hydraclear plus) for seven years. He was a computer engineer working with computer for about 8 to 10 hours daily.
"A 25-year-old gravida 3, para1 was admitted at 19 weeks of pregnancy with a history of vaginal bleeding for 1 week and pain in abdomen. She was told that she had a low lying placenta during her second trimester scan. A lower segment caesarean section for cephalopelvic disproportion was done 2 years back and the baby was alive and well. This was followed by a missed abortion at 8 weeks for which a curettage was done. At admission, her vitals were stable. Uterus was irritable. Hb was 7 gm/dL. Ultrasound done after admission showed a live fetus of 20 weeks and anterior placenta with a thin, bulging, and deficient lower uterine segment. The decidual interface between the placenta and myometrium was partially absent and there were large dilated vessels in the same area. These sonographic features were suggestive of a placenta accreta. Patient continued to bleed; 4 units of blood were crossmatched and injection of methotrexate 50 mg was given intramuscularly on the day of admission. Prophylactic uterine artery embolisation was done on day 2 but the bleeding continued. The next day she was taken up for hysterotomy under general anaesthesia. Entry into peritoneal cavity was difficult because of dense adhesions. There was no hemoperitoneum. Bladder was adherent to the lower uterine segment which was severely deficient. Placenta was encroaching on the left broad ligament and was covered by a thin layer of peritoneum. Bladder was dissected from the lower uterine segment and incision was given at the previous scar. Fetus was extracted out first and placenta was then clearly seen to be firmly adherent to myometrium at several sites. Most of it could be removed piecemeal. Hemorrhage was controlled by uterotonics and hemostatic sutures at the placental bed. The estimated blood loss was approximately 1 litre. Two units of blood were transfused intraoperatively. Her postoperative Hb was 8 gm/dL. Catheter was removed on day 5. Recovery was uneventful. She was discharged 1 week later on iron tablets and contraceptive advice."
"A 25-year-old woman with no past medical or surgical history was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) after being kicked by a horse in her chest. The patient was found to have a midsternal fracture with underlying hematoma on computed tomography (CT) chest (see ). Her blood pressure was 102/67 mm hg, her heart rate was 58/min, and her respiratory rate was 18/min, and oxygen saturation was 99% while breathing room air. Her white blood cell count was normal and her hemoglobin was 14.1 gm/L. The creatinine phosphokinase 494/L (normal 38/L–174/L) and troponin level was 3.74 μg/L (0.00–0.08 μg/L). These were felt to be secondary to a blunt cardiac contusion. Her elevated cardiac enzymes reverted back to normal within 48 hours.\nThe patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm with rate of 65 bpm (beats per minute) with first-degree atrioventricular block (AV Block) and left anterior hemiblock as depicted in . The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for observation. 13 hours after her injury, she developed a third-degree AV block along with left bundle branch block with the rate of 55 bpm (see ). At that point, she was totally asymptomatic with normal hemodynamic parameters. A cardiology consultant was obtained and felt that the patient's AVB was likely secondary to the substernal hematoma causing mechanical compression of the AV bundle. A 2D echocardiogram was normal with no evidence of cardiac injury with a normal with an ejection fraction of 70%. She was kept in CCU and within seventy-two hours, her rhythm converted to normal sinus rhythm with rate of 85 bpm and first-degree AV block and left anterior hemiblock as depicted in . She was discharged home in a stable condition with an outpatient followup with her primary care physician. A four-week followup revealed that the EKG is in normal sinus rhythm with the rate of 56 bpm (see )."
"The patient is a 25-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital due to a severe bilateral compressive headache which had started a month prior to admission with a change in patterns like an increase in severity and frequency. She had visited clinics and got painkillers three to four times per week the previous month. She had also experienced diplopia two weeks prior to admission.\nRegarding her past medical history, she had Crohn’s disease and several episodes of fistula formation which had been repaired by surgery, and she had received two doses of infliximab three months and one month before admission. Her vitals were all within normal limits. In the physical exam, all components of head and neck, chest, heart and lung sounds, abdomen and extremities were all normal. In the neurological examination, the eye examination revealed left eye abduction limitation and a 4+ papilledema and optic disc hemorrhage in the funduscopic examination; the rest of the neurological exam was intact, including normal mental status, motor, sensory and coordination.\nIn terms of her lab data, biochemistry, Prothrombin Time (PT) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) were all within the normal range. Regarding her complete blood count, white blood cell count was 8900/dL, red blood cell count was 3,830,000/dL, hemoglobin was 7 g/dL, hematocrit was 27%, mean corpuscular volume was 70.5 FL, platelet count was 122,000, and ferritin level was 5 ng/mL. Other systemic evaluations such as liver function tests, thyroid function tests, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were all within the normal range. The first brain CT was normal. The diagnostic and therapeutic lumbar puncture had been done as well. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 22 cm H2O, and the CSF analysis was normal. We started on acetazolamide (250 milligrams, three times a day) and topiramate (20 milligrams, twice a day); iron and folic acid were added as well. On the third day of hospitalization, the patient developed a decreased level of consciousness and left side hemiparesis, and she was transferred to the ICU and got intubated. Another computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging were requested which showed hyperintensity in the right hemisphere and Labbe vein drainage zone, indicating cortical venous thrombosis, although transverse and sagittal sinuses were open ( and ). We started heparin for the patient. She also received two units of packed cells due to her low hemoglobin. Her level of consciousness increased after three days, and she got extubated. All the other symptoms started to resolve, and she was discharged after a week."
"A 25-year-old man post renal transplant two year ago. He presented to the emergency department with left hypochondrial swelling, that he noticed three months ago. It became painful for 2 weeks duration with no changes in the size or discharge from the lesion. He denied a history of trauma and fever. He is non-smoker, his psychosocial, drug and family history were unremarkable.\nOn examination, the patient was vitally stable, looks well and not in pain. Abdominal examination revealed a lesion located in the anterior abdominal wall, the area between the left hypochondrial and lower chest. The swelling was about 3 × 3 cm, tender with minimal erythema and hotness but no discharge.\nThe routine laboratory works up were unremarkable. An ultrasound was done while scanning the left anterior abdominal wall at the area of concern, it showed superficial oval shaped with thick wall and mildly increased peripheral vascularity without internal vascularity []. In correlation to the clinical information of tenderness and redness, the findings are more likely going with infected subcutaneous soft tissue lesion, managed with oral antibiotic.\nHe then presented to the clinic a week later with the same history given previously, a surgical excision proposed to the patient and was done under local anesthesia by general surgeon. During the procedure, the excised mass was found to be round in shape, soft tissue in character, adhesion to the surrounding tissue which was excised with healthy margins and sent for histopathology review.\nThe histopathology findings of the lesion show a necrotic tissue with peripheral spindle cells with prominent nuclear pallisading (Verocay Bodies) []. The spindle cells have indistinct cell border, eosinophilic cytoplasm. and spindle to plump nuclei. Well controlled immunostains show that the tumor cells are positive for S100 [], but negative for CD34, SMA, Desmin, beta-catenin, c-KIT and DOG-1. The final diagnosis was schwannoma with ancient changes i.e. (Intralesional histiocytes and hyalinized blood vessels) [] and negative for malignancy.\nThe patient had uneventful procedure with no complications and was discharged home in a good condition and followed regularly in the clinic, He experienced improvement in his symptoms, quality of life and the capability of coping with daily demands."
"A 25-year-old woman, with no history of recent travel, was admitted at the Emergency ward on December 18, 2019, for a one-week progressive dyspnoea, preceded by dry cough and fever. She had no particular medical history and was a nurse in a hospital where Chinese employees from a multinational mining company are treated, of whom some had recently travelled from China (the place they came from in China could not be determined) and three of them had presented flu-like symptoms within 2 weeks. On admission, she could not complete sentences due to dyspnoea. At ambient air, she presented a SaO2 of 82% and signs of respiratory distress without cyanosis. Her pulmonary and cardiac auscultation was normal.\nThe chest X-rays showed reticular lines and peribronchovascular haziness in the infrahilar and retrocardiac regions, bilaterally. This suggested a mild interstitial pneumonia (Fig. a, b). Laboratory results showed a slight inflammation with CRP at 14.5 mg/l, lymphopenia (700 lymphocytes/μl) and normal procalcitonin (< 0.1 ng/ml). The ABG showed a hypoxemia (PaO2 60 mmHg) and a respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.51, PaCO2 35 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 286 mmHg, bicarbonate 27.1 mmol/l, and lactates 1.50 mmol/l). Creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and blood electrolytes were normal. HIV serology was negative.\nA diagnosis of moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to a viral pneumonia was retained and the patient was admitted in the ICU, receiving oxygen (4 l/min), azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 5 days) and Duovent® in nebulization. Three days later, she was eupnoeic with normal SaO2 at ambient air. She was discharged from hospital 5 days after admission (Fig. )."
"A 25-years-old man with no medical history was admitted to the ED after a high-speed car vehicle accident.\nAt his admission, the vital signs were as follow: Glasgow coma score 12/15, no signs of localization, tachycardia with pulse of 126 beats/min, and hypotensive with blood pressure 75/45mmhg with no signs of external bleeding or medullar trauma and distended abdomen.\nThe initial complete blood count and arterial blood gas were as followed: hemoglobin 8 g/dl, hematocrit 25%, thrombopenia with platelet amount of 70,000/mm3, fibrinogen at 1.5 g/l, and prothrombin ratio 55% with severe lactate acidemia: pH of 7.07 and lactate 9 mmol/l.\nIntravenous perfusion of 1 L of saline serum was initiated with norepinephrine perfusion, and the patient was put on mechanical ventilation.\nMassif transfusion protocol MTP was lunched with transfusion of four fresh frozen plasma, four packed red blood cells, and four platelets units.\nThe full body CT scan was obtained after hemodynamic stabilization, no acute injuries were notes on head and thoracic images (). The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed massive hemoperitoneum and multiples liver lacerations extending to the IVC ().\nThe patient was taken to the OR for damage control laparotomy. Upon opening the abdomen, he was actively bleeding with visualization of large laceration of the right liver. The decision was made to leave five sponges packed around the liver and leave the abdomen open for a second look surgery.\nThe patient turned to the intensive care unit, he kept worsening on clinical and biological levels: hypotensive despite MTP, norepinephrine infusion and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration with apparition of multi-organ failure: kidney failure, liver failure, consumptive coagulopathy and severe lactic academia (pH 6.9, lactate 12 mmol/l).\nThe patient died after 12 h with multi-organ failure.\nThis case report follows SCARE guidelines []."
"Case 2: A 25-year-old pregnant woman at 11 + 3 weeks of gestation was hospitalized at HEAPN with a diagnosis of spontaneous aborted pregnancy, which started 24 h before with mild vaginal bleeding and pain in the lower abdomen. She reported no symptom suggestive of CHIKV infection during pregnancy. She did not start prenatal care, did not use medication and had no comorbidities. A fetal ultrasound was performed that showed a topical gestational sac with regular contours and a large amount of amorphous echoes around, with an average diameter of 13 mm. Vitelline embryo and vesicle were not observed. A dilation of the cervix was performed with a Hegar candle and then winter curettage with moderate outflow of the ovarian remains. Laboratory tests results were IgM serological tests negative for ZIKV and DENV and positive for CHIKV; RT-PCR for CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV negative; rapid tests for syphilis and HIV negative and a normal blood count."
"Case 4: A 25-year-old pregnant woman at 15 + 6 weeks of gestation hospitalized with a diagnosis of abortion and endometritis after mild vaginal bleeding for the last 5 days, pain in the lower abdomen and expulsion of the fetus at home. She reported symptoms suggestive of CHIKV infection: fever, arthralgia, rash and itching. She did not start prenatal care, did not use medication and had no comorbidities. Treatment with antibiotic therapy was started: clindamycin (four days) and amikacin (three days), due to leukocytosis on admission. Winter curettage was performed, with the removal of the ovular remains in small quantities. Laboratory tests results were IgM serological tests negative for ZIKV and DENV and positive for CHIKV; RT-PCR for CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV negative; rapid tests for syphilis and HIV negative and a normal blood count, except for leukocytosis."
"A 25-year-old female otherwise healthy, a doctor by profession, presented to the rheumatology outpatient clinic with complaints of generalized joint pains for the last 15 days, associated with morning stiffness of 40 minutes. According to the patient, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection 2 months back after a history of recent travel. Her pain temporarily subsided on potent analgesics. On examination, there were signs of inflammation (swelling, warmth, and tenderness) over her ankles and MTP joints bilaterally. There was also tenderness noted in her MCP and wrist joints bilaterally. Her RA factor and anti-CCP were negative. Musculoskeletal ultrasound findings are as follows (Figures – ): Grade 1 synovitis in bilateral MCP joints 2 to 5 and Grade 1 synovitis in bilateral PIP joints 2 to 5 Grade 1 synovitis in both wrists Bilateral ankle Grade 2 synovitis and bilateral Achilles tendonitis Grade 2 synovitis in bilateral MTP joints 2 and 5 Power Doppler negative No bony erosions seen"
"A 25-year-old female referred to the Department of Neurosurgery in Sina Hospital affiliated to TUMS with a four months history of generalized headache. At first, the outpatient examination finding was unremarkable. The patient’s family history and past medical history was also unremarkable. No neurological sign was found. The patient underwent plain radiography, which showed a calcified lesion on the right frontoparietal lobe. The brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with and without contrast showed a lobulated intra-axial mass in the right frontoparietal lobe with heterogeneous enhancement and mild peripheral edema. Shift of falx cerebri to the left side was seen. The radiological diagnosis was low grade glioma or meningioma (). The diagnosis required histopathologic confirmation. The patient underwent an excisional surgery. She well tolerated the procedure without complications. The received specimen for pathology examination consisted of multiple pieces of tan firm tissue totally measuring 12×8×2.5 cm. Histological examinations revealed portions of mature cartilage with lobular architecture. No atypia or mitotic figures and necrosis were seen (). Therefore, our case was compatible with chondroma and diagnosis was confirmed. Based on the diagnosis, the patient received no additional treatment. After 6 months of follow-up examinations, no recurrence was observed and the patient is still asymptomatic."
"A 25-year-old male presented for routine ophthalmologic examination without visual symptoms and a negative history of albinism and any other retinal disease. The best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 with a refractive error of +1.50 diopters spherical equivalent. His OCT findings revealed a grade 1 foveal hypoplasia, according to the classification of Thomas et al. () (). The OCTA examination confirmed the absence of a detectable foveal avascular zone (), and the morphological conformation of the foveal region (, inset) revealed the absence of a discernable ICP. In this case, the anatomical segmentation of the en face OCTA slabs was inaccurate for the irregular contour of the INL at this level. For this reason, the OCTA b scan segmentation and subsequent analysis appeared more accurate and reproducible, as shown in .\nIt is worthy of note, in this case, that the ICP was not apparent, and the SVC and DCP exhibited direct vertical connections in the central macular region (, insets). At the parafoveal region, the ICP appeared discernible again, presenting multiple interconnections with the SVC and the DCP."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with four gunshot wounds to the right hip, right flank, left flank and left posterior thorax. Upon arrival the patient was hemodynamically stable with a Glasgow coma score of 15. Chest and abdominal plain films demonstrated a left-sided hemothorax, scattered bullet fragments within the left hemithorax and multiple bullet fragments in the abdominal cavity. A left tube thoracostomy was placed yielding immediate output of 575cc sanguineous fluid and the patient was taken for an exploratory laparotomy. A left diaphragmatic defect was identified with splenic herniation into the left thorax. Splenectomy and primary diaphragmatic repair were performed. Multiple bowel injuries were encountered necessitating several segmental resections. The next day a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was obtained, which identified presence of two bullet fragments in the interventricular septum ( and ).\nThe patient recovered without complications other than a persistent, asymptomatic, sinus tachycardia with heart rate sustained at 120 beats per minute. On post-trauma Day 10 an echocardiogram was obtained, which again demonstrated two bullet fragments retained within the interventricular septum, a small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade and no evidence of ventricular septal defect (). Non-operative management of the retained septal projectiles was pursued. Empiric colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for post-traumatic pericarditis prophylaxis was prescribed. Four days later the patient’s tachycardia resolved spontaneously. Point of care ultrasound demonstrated resolution of the pericardial effusion. The patient was discharged from the hospital on post-trauma Day 19 with a 2-month course of colchicine. At outpatient follow-up, he continued to maintain normal sinus rhythm without evidence of effusion or pericarditis."
"A 25-year-old man visited the emergency room because of sudden severe right flank pain. He was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease due to Alport syndrome and had been receiving maintenance hemodialysis 3 times a week for 4 hours per session since 2013. The last hemodialysis session was the previous day, and 1000 units of heparin were administered as an initial bolus dose followed by an infusion of 500 units per hour of heparin 3 times as a maintenance dose. He had no history of trauma or urological procedures except for a left renal biopsy to diagnose Alport syndrome 10 years prior. His blood pressure was well controlled by taking antihypertensive drugs and undergoing regular hemodialysis. The patient had no other symptoms or signs during hemodialysis. His vital signs at the emergency room were as follows: blood pressure, 160/100 mm Hg; heart rate, 77 beats per minute; body temperature, 36.5°C; and respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute. Initial laboratory findings revealed white blood cell count 9080/mm3, hemoglobin 11.7 g/dL, hematocrit 35%, platelets 203,000/μL, blood urea nitrogen 26 mg/dL, creatinine 9.32 mg/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 5 mm/hour, and C-reactive protein 0.9 mg/L. His prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were within the normal ranges. He complained of progressively worsening right flank pain, and his hemoglobin level also decreased to 10.1 g/dL. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a right perirenal hematoma with pseudoaneurysms (Fig. ). On renal angiography, multiple pseudoaneurysms were observed in the right renal artery branches, and embolization was performed (Fig. ). Post-embolization angiography revealed no pseudoaneurysms or contrast leakage.\nThe size of the perirenal hematoma slightly decreased on CT 10 days after embolization. He had no more abdominal pain, and his hemoglobin level did not change. The patient was discharged with instructions to maintain heparin-free hemodialysis. On outpatient blood tests 3 weeks later, his hemoglobin level was 11.6 g/dL, and he did not report any discomfort. After 3 months, we performed another CT scan, which confirmed that the perirenal hematoma and retrohemoperitoneum had completely resolved (Fig. ). The patient started using heparin again at the previous dose during hemodialysis. He had no recurrence of symptoms even after heparin was resumed during hemodialysis."
"A 25-year-old man with more than a 10-year history of biopsy-proven FD was referred to our tertiary center for management. Clinical examination revealed extensive scarring hair loss on the central scalp with perifollicular erythema (3+), scale (3+), pustules (3+), tufted hair, and purulent discharge (, A). The patient had tried numerous treatments, including oral antibiotics (doxycycline, minocycline, clindamycin, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), topical salicylic acid 5% shampoo, topical clindamycin lotion, oral isotretinoin 80 mg daily, and oral and intralesional corticosteroids for 6 months without any improvement. The patient received 3 PRP treatments in combination with TAC at 6- to 9-week intervals, while continuing oral doxycycline, topical salicylic acid shampoo, and topical clindamycin lotion. Upon completion of 3 PRP treatments, clinical examination showed a noticeable improvement in erythema (2+), scale (1+), and pustules (1+) and a resolution of purulent discharge (, B). However, continued PRP treatment was necessary to maintain disease stability as the patient experienced a relapse within a 5-month break during COVID-19 quarantine."
"A 25-year-old woman in Sichuan (southwest China) was admitted to the hospital because of a sudden headache for nine days. She had a history of thalassemia and splenectomy nine years prior. Physical examination revealed that the patient was pale and without any neurological deficits. In this case report, we did not provide an experimental intervention, so there was no need for ethical review. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\nLaboratory examinations showed the following indicators: white blood cells, 11.41∗10^9/L hemoglobin, 58 g/L; hematocrit, 20.6%; and platelets, 702∗10^9/L. Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed hemoglobin A 0.00% (96.8%–97.8%), hemoglobin F 50% (0–2.0%), and hemoglobin A2 3.6% (2.2%–3.2%). The serum ferritin level was 1733ng/ml. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a small hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe (Fig. A). Therefore, the diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage is clear. However, the patient was young and had significant blood abnormalities; therefore, secondary intracranial hemorrhage was highly suspected. We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MRI showed an irregular lesion located in the left lateral transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus area of the left occipital region with T1WI high signal, T2WI low signal, and FLAIR mixed signal (Fig. B–D). DSA showed left transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus occlusion, filling defect of right transverse sinus, two aneurysms located in the C6 segment of the right internal carotid artery(ICA) with the size of 4.9∗5.7 mm and 2.1∗1.3 mm (Fig. E,F). For blood abnormalities, we performed a genetic test to screen for the cause of anemia. The gene mutation of globin in the peripheral blood samples of the patient was analyzed and identified using polymerase chain reaction-reverse dot blot (PCR-RDB). The results showed that there was double heterozygosity for IVS-II-654 (HBB:c.316_197C > T) and Hb E (HBB:c.79G > A). The diagnosis was intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, intracranial aneurysm and double heterozygous beta-thalassemia major.\nThe patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin sodium injection (4100IU sc q12 h), and her headache was relieved significantly within 48 h. One week later, a re-examination of the CT scan showed that the hemorrhage was completely absorbed. Her treatment was switched to warfarin after four days of overlap with low-molecular-weight heparin sodium injection, and she started taking hydroxyurea, and she was discharged from the hospital.\nThe patient is in stable condition and is being followed up regularly by the hematology department."
"A 25-year-old woman was treated for COVID-19 for 14 days and had negative results in two consecutive viral RNA tests. On the 1st day at hospital, chest CT showed a consolidation opacity in the lower lobe of the left lung (). On the 5th day, the consolidation opacity expanded, subpleural consolidations were seen with surrounding halo signs (). On the 10th day, the consolidation opacity in the lower lobe of the left lung showed reduced density and size (). One the 13th day, this consolidation was absorbed with residual scattered ground-glass opacities ()."
"The second patient in the case series was a 25-year-old female. The patient presented in the OPD with an insidious onset and progressive swelling in the wrist. X-ray showed an ill-defined osteolytic lesion involving the carpal bones. The lesion also showed cortical erosion and periosteal reactive bone formation. A clinical provisional diagnosis of an aneurysmal bone cyst was made. The patient was treated with bone curettage. Microscopy showed a nodular/lobular growth pattern of a vascular neoplasm without any demonstrable vessel origin. The central growth pattern was in diffuse sheets. Focal spindling of the cells was noted, which were arranged in fascicles with slit-like vascularity. Peripheral well-formed blood vessels were seen with epithelioid endothelial cells showing prominent hobnailing (Figure ).\nThe tumor-associated stroma showed sheets of eosinophils, eosinophilic microabscesses, along with lymphocytes and plasma cells. Focal lymphoid aggregates were seen but were negative for germinal centers (Figure ).\nThere was focal spindling of cells arranged in fascicles with slit-like vasculature. A diagnosis of EH involving the carpal bones was made. There was no recurrence on follow-up. The patient was declared cured and no subsequent treatment was given on follow-up."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a one-week history of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea. She had a past medical history of papillary thyroid carcinoma with complete thyroidectomy, UC status post colectomy with IPAA (J-pouch). Her pain was most intense in the left lower abdominal quadrant and only relieved by heating pads. She stated an increased frequency of abdominal bowel movements (her regular bowel movements were four/day). She denied any environmental exposures, dietary changes, fevers, chills but stated malaise. The patient was initially placed nil per oral and started on intravenous fluids for dehydration. Her laboratory works up for inflammatory markers, and routine workup was negative, including thyroid panel. Her stool osmolality was 309 mOsm/kg, consistent with secretory diarrhea and abdominopelvic CT scan revealed J-pouch thickening without evidence of bowel obstruction, ascites, adenopathy, or pneumoperitoneum. The Clostridium difficile toxin was negative and stool culture failed to grow anything. Due to her history of UC and surgical intervention, she underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy by gastroenterology and was noted to have a patchy area of mild erythematous mucosa (Figure ). A tentative diagnosis of ileal pouchitis was made due to erythema on sigmoidoscopy.\nThe patient was started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole and discharged with a follow-up in the clinic. Her biopsy later revealed severe acute inflammation and degenerative changes without adenomatous dysplasia or malignancy. She received ten days of ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day and metronidazole 500 mg twice a day with resolutions of symptoms."
"A 25-year-old man, who underwent several resections for recurrent osteosarcoma, was referred for resection of a progressively growing abdominal nodule of 21 mm in size detected on routine computed tomography that was suspected to be a metastatic lesion. At explorative midline laparotomy, no other metastases were found. The lesion was situated in the mesocolon adjacent to the descending colon and consequently a mesenteric resection sparing the left colic artery was performed. Visual assessment of the colon showed slight discoloration at the resection side over a trajectory of 4 cm. Intraoperative subjective fluorescence assessment of the bowel perfusion showed slightly slower increase of fluorescence intensity of the bowel segment at risk (), but this part became as fluorescent as the reference bowel within one minute. The perfusion was judged as being sufficient and it was decided to not perform a bowel segment resection. The postoperative period was uneventful, and discharge was at postoperative day 3.\nPostoperative quantitative fluorescence analysis showed lower maximum fluorescence intensities (27.3 versus 39.2 versus 50.8 AU), inflow slope (0.76 versus 1.56 versus ), and (1.05 versus 2.04 versus ) in the affected bowel compared to the transition zone and reference bowel (). Furthermore, (36 versus 25 versus 19 s), (12 versus 9.5 versus 7.5 s) and TR (0.33 versus 0.38 versus 0.39) were lower at the transition zone and directly perfused reference bowel segments."
"A 25-year-old male was in a tragic traffic accident, resulting in the loss of nearly one-third of his left foot and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from the wound (Fig. ). Although the orthopedic department recommended amputation, we reconstructed the foot with a free iliac bone and radial forearm free flap. After 1 year, the infection was controlled and the patient had a normal gait without any other complications."
"The healthy younger adult (YA1) was a 25-year-old man (PSQI=5 and ESS=3) who did not report any sleep disorders. One day of YA1 data, including wrist temperature, AX3 data, and sleep onset or offset detected by Mi Band 2, is shown in . The sleep period and wake period can be distinguished using AX3 data, which shows that YA1 was mostly static with a relatively high and stable wrist temperature during sleep. The sleep onset and offset detected by the Mi Band 2 align well with changes in AX3 and wrist temperature data."
"The first case is a 25-year-old woman with loss of visual acuity (VA) in the right eye (RE) for one year. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.5 (decimal scale, Snellen) in the RE and 1.0 in the left eye (LE). In the RE, she also presented alteration of the external ocular movements with limitation to supraduction and abduction (Figures and ), proptosis of 9 mm (), lagophthalmos of 3–4 mm, and a mass in the upper orbital region. The LE did not show any alteration. Orbital echography showed an extraconal superior mass with high density and an irregular pattern (). In the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an extraconal, superior, and central orbital mass was observed; it measured 3.7 × 3.5 × 1.7 cm and extended up to the posterior third of the orbit, with hyperintensity on T2-weighted scans and hypointensity in T1-weighted scans (Figures and ), compatible with cavernous angioma or meningioma. An upper orbitotomy was performed through the upper lid crease with dissection and removal of a compact, depressible pink lesion, which is well defined and without nutrient vascularization (). Microscopically, the tumor was composed of a proliferation of spindle cells arranged in an irregular manner with a focal storiform pattern, bland cytology, and vascular proliferation with an HPC-like grown pattern. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD34, CD99, BCL2, vimentin, and myoglobin (Figures –). The tumor was negative for AE1-AE3 cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S100 protein, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and desmin. Mitotic activity showed a low mitosis index (<1–4 high-power fields (HPF)). There was no evidence of hemorrhage, necrosis, or infiltrative borders nor architectural signs of malignancy. After 15 years of follow-up, there has been no evidence of recurrence."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with a right breast lump existing for eight months. The mass had rapidly increased in size. Her menstrual cycles were regular and she was not on any hormone therapy. Clinical examination showed a firm and mobile breast tumour on the outer quadrant of the right breast of approximately 10 cm in size, with dilated veins on overlying skin (Figures , ). There was no axillary lymphadenopathy. Ultrasonography (US) showed a well-defined hypoechoic tumour measuring 10 x 8 cm. Core needle biopsy confirmed fibroadenoma.\nThe patient underwent right-sided lumpectomy and reconstruction with lateral oncoplasty under general anaesthesia. A skin crease incision was placed in the axillary fold. Subsequently, the skin flap was raised medially over the tumour with a flap thickness of 3-4 mm. The lump was well defined (Figure ) and almost the entire normal breast tissue of the affected breast was compressed on to one side by the lump. The lump was completely excised, which left a big defect. An inferolateral glandular flap was raised and advanced upward and medially and fixed with a 2/0 absorbable monofilament suture to the compressed normal breast parenchyma (Figure ). A suction drain was left in situ over the pectoral fascia and the wound closed with subcuticular sutures (Figure ).\nThe post-operative period was uneventful. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day after the removal of the drain. The patient was followed up at 10 days, one month, three months, and one year. Complete symmetry was achieved between both the breasts with good cosmesis (Figure ).\nThe actual size of the tumour was 10 x 8 x 4 cm. Histopathology showed marked stromal and epithelial proliferation with proliferating stroma around numerous ducts in a peri-canalicular pattern. There was no stromal atypia and no evidence of malignancy. The final diagnosis was reported as giant fibroadenoma."
"A 25-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room complaining of dyspnea and chest pain, which persisted for the last two months. Upon physical examination on admission, the blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg and the pulse was at 100 bpm. The patient was alert, and there was no elevated jugular venous pressure, but she had muffled heart sounds and the lungs were clear on auscultation. Chest radiography presented enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (), and electrocardiography showed low-voltage complexes. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a large pericardial effusion and signs consistent with cardiac tamponade. Chest TC was performed, showing large pericardial effusion and small pleural effusion on the right hemithorax ().\nThe patient was referred to the ICU and underwent a pericardial window through a right video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS) (). Pericardial window showed 500 ml of a milky fluid. There were no pleural remarkable findings.\nDuring hospital stay, lymphangioscintigraphy showed no abnormal findings. Pericardial fluid examination revealed a triglyceride level of 2050 mg/dl, total protein 5.6 g/l and glucose 154 mg/dl, all values consistent with chylopericardium. The postoperative course was uneventful; the chest tube was removed on day three, and the patient was discharged on day five. After one-year follow-up, the patient was in good condition and presented no signs of recurrence."
"The second case is a 25-year-old boy afflicted to one episode of recent seizure. He had a history of cigarette smoking and two episodes of seizure on childhood. He was well on admission in our center. On evaluation, a wide neck saccular aneurysm was found at basilar artery- right P1 junction (). Similarly, due to aneurysm situation (right P1 originate from aneurysm sac) coiling alone is a dangerous option. Therefore, we put a fellow-diverter stent in basilar-right P1 to create new and safe lumen and then through previously positioned microcatheter in the aneurysm sac, coil placement in the sac was done (stent-assisted coiling). Before the procedure, he used same drugs same as the first case. After 2 months follow-up, he has had good condition and the aneurysm was completely treated angiographically ()."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with a main complaint of severe spontaneous and lingering pain in tooth number 36, occurring several times over the previous two weeks. Pain was provoked by chewing or cold drinks. Clinical examination recorded caries extending to the pulp tissue, and the tooth was also sensitive to vertical and horizontal percussion. Periapical radiograph demonstrated widened periodontal ligament space at the mesial root (). The tooth was diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis.\nAfter receiving the informed consent from the patient, the same procedure as above was applied. The coronal pulp was removed to the level of the canal orifices. Bleeding was confirmed from all root orifices. After hemostasis was obtained, the pulp chamber was filled with BiodentineTM as a capping agent and temporary restorative material.\nThe patient reported mild pain on the operation day, but the pain was reduced from the following day. One month later, the patient did not feel discomfort upon chewing, although vertical percussion caused a slight pain. The superficial layer of BiodentineTM was removed, then the tooth was permanently restored with composite resin. After 6 months, there was no sensitivity to percussion and the periodontal ligament space improved. A 24-month examination indicated the periodontal ligament space had returned to the normal state, the tooth had no symptoms, and showed negative responses to cold and electric pulp tests."
"This 25 years old lady (proband: MC4) was first detected to be having renal dysfunction during the third trimester of pregnancy with a serum creatinine of 13 mg/dL and hemoglobin level of 4 g/dL. Though the patient was hypertensive in the first trimester as well, she was not investigated further. On further evaluation, she was detected to be having normal size kidneys. However, it was decided not to go ahead with renal biopsy at that gestation and she continued on hemodialysis. She delivered a 1.5 kg baby and subsequently, her creatinine settled to around 3–4 mg/dL. She was lost to follow up and again presented with azotemic symptoms and serum creatinine of 21 mg/dL, five months down the line. The patient underwent live-related renal transplantation at the age of 23 years, with the donor being her father of age 45 years in 2018. Post-transplantation, the patient had an uneventful course except for an occasional episode of UTI. She has normal allograft function two years post-transplant with no complications and normal renal function. Her previous pregnancy was at the age of 21 years and she delivered at full term by cesarean section. She did not have a bad obstetric history. She underwent all the routine investigations during her first pregnancy and no abnormality was detected at that time. The detailed (follow up) report of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria in the MC4 (V-1) case has been displayed in Fig. .\nThe proband (MC4) had 05 siblings with 04 sisters and 01 brother. There is a family history of renal disease in two of her younger sisters (MC6 and MC7). Both of them were detected to have renal failure at the age of 15 and 16 years, respectively and subsequently became dialysis-dependent. Renal biopsy was not done in any of the siblings. Unfortunately, both of them succumbed to complications related to renal failure. The exact cause of death in both of them could not be ascertained."
"A 25-year-old lactating female with no comorbidities presented with a painless and fixed lump in her left breast. The patient noticed the sudden onset of the lump a year ago. The lump demonstrated a gradual increase in its size. The patient underwent physical examination by the breast surgeon that revealed a nontender and smooth mass in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast. The mass was soft to firm in consistency, demonstrated well-defined margins, and measured between 2 and 2.5 cm on palpation. On the basis of clinical history and physical examination, a provisional diagnosis of fibroadenoma was considered. The breast mass was excised and the patient did not undergo further investigations. Two months after the surgery, she presented with a recurrent lump on her left breast. A computed tomography (CT) with contrast was done for reassessment. CT showed regrowth of the mass in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast, with enlarged, matted, and necrotic ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. She underwent wide local excision of the lump with ipsilateral axillary clearance in June 2020. Histopathology of the excised lump revealed a malignant PT with a maximum dimension of 2.5 cm (Figure ). All margins of the excised lump were free of tumors; however, the involvement of the lymph nodes was positive demonstrating metastasis (Figure ).\nLocoregional radiotherapy was administered in July 2020. Two months after the completion of the treatment, a follow-up CT scan revealed suspicious lung nodules. She was referred for restaging with FDG PET-CT (Figure ).\nPET image (Figure ) showed multiple hypermetabolic bilateral pulmonary masses, along with osseous and bone marrow metastases. Mildly avid cutaneous thickening was observed in the left breast, demonstrating a low standardized uptake value (SUVmax 1.7) (Figure ).\nThe unique finding was a focal hypermetabolic and hypodense lesion in the left soleus (SUVmax 3.2) (Figure ). The patient died due to extensive distant metastases over a short span of time."
"Our third patient was a female in her 20s, who underwent an ACLR with endobutton anteromedial portal technique in 2014. Her knee was more stable since reconstruction, but she still complained of giving way during moderate exercises, with Lachman 1+ and Pivot Shift grade 2. Physiotherapy was not effective. Plain X-Ray and MRI showed an intact ACL graft with adequate tunnel positioning ()."
"The fourth patient was a female in her 20s, who underwent an ACLR (all-inside technique) in 2018. After one year she still experienced giving way during moderate exercise, with Lachman 1+, and Pivot Shift grade 2. Physiotherapy was not effective. Plain X-Ray and MRI showed an intact ACL graft with adequate tunnel positioning ().\nAll four patients underwent an isolated LET procedure, conducted under regional anesthesia with the patient in supine position, the knee in 90 degrees. A thigh tourniquet was used with 250 mmHg pressure. An incision was made at the lateral aspect of the knee, from the lateral epicondyle towards Gerdy's tubercle. The iliotibial band was exposed and a 9 by 1 cm strip was excised from the middle part of the iliotibial band, leaving its distal end attached to Gerdy's tubercle (). The free end of the graft was whipstitched with a high strength braided suture (Vicryl 2, Ethicon). Then the graft was rerouted by a curved clamp deep to the lateral collateral ligament. A femoral tunnel was created just proximal and anterior to the lateral epicondyle by drilling a 2.4 mm eyelet pin through the lateral cortex out of the medial femoral cortex in slightly anterior and proximal direction. The guidepin was overreamed by a 6 mm cannulated reamer to a minimum depth of 30 mm. Then the passing suture was threaded through the eyelet and pulled into the femoral tunnel. The graft was fixated in 30 degrees of knee flexion with a 7 mm interference screw, keeping the foot in neutral tibial rotation under slight tension over the graft (20N). The iliotibial band, subcutaneous tissue, and skin were closed layer by layer using absorbable sutures.\nPostoperatively, patients were mobilized with two crutches and weightbearing was allowed as tolerated for a minimum of two weeks. Free passive and active movement were allowed under physiotherapy supervision.\nPre- and postoperative outcome scores were assessed, including Lachman and Pivot Shift tests, Lysholm and Tegner scores. All four patients had an uneventful recovery after their LET procedure and showed improvement of outcome scores at one-year follow-up. There was improvement in Lachman test, Pivot test and Lysholm score post-operatively. Postoperative Lachman scores of all patients were + 1 that showed good anterior-posterior stability, while postoperative Pivot score decreased from +2 to negative for all patients, showing restored rotatory stability. All patients reported improved adequate subjective stability. Postoperative Lysholm scores were increased with a mean of 19.75 points, and Tegner scores returned to pre-injury level ()."
"We report a 25-year-old female patient who presented with necrosis on the proximal dorsoradial fourth digit of the left hand after excessive and repetitive use of hydrochloric acid as a wart self-treatment. After initial debridement and exploration of the seventh neurovascular bundle (radial neurovascular bundle of the fourth digit) from the dorsoradial defect zone, which was intact, a defect of 2 × 2 cm size and exposed extensor tendon apparatus with the absence of parathenon resulted. After histological and microbiological results excluded infection or malignancy the second operation was performed. For the reconstructive approach, the third webspace DMCA flap was planned ().\nAt first, the distal and proximal perforator of the dorsal metacarpal artery III were identified and evaluated for reconstruction. The proximal perforator (Quaba perforator) was favorized as the distal was too close to the zone of injury and the soft tissue showed signs of inflammation.\nAfter preparation of the pedicle, the flap was completely raised. The branch of the dorsal ulnar nerve innervating the DMCA flap was identified on the proximal ulnar side of the flap and dissected. The cutaneous branch only innervated the skin area of the flap, so no donor side morbidity (potential loss of sensation in the digit) had to be expected. As 180-degree rotation of the flap into the defect was not feasible due to the nerve course, the nerve branch was cut, and the recipient nerve was ‘flipped’ on the undersurface of the flap around to reach the donor without tension. After assuring the integrity of the vascular flap supply was intact, an end-to-end neurorrhaphy with 9-0 Ethilon (Ethicon, Germany) microsutures was performed.\nAfter the operation, no adverse events appeared and after suture removal a compression glove was suited. Our patient reported regaining sensation with a two-point discrimination of 10 mm and 7/10 in the Ten test in an eight-month follow-up and showed a full range of motion."
"Patient 5 a 25-year-old man was admitted to a hospital with loss of consciousness and bleeding from the external acoustic canal and the oral and nasal cavity after a 5-meter fall. Cranial CT confirmed bilateral frontal, right temporal and left occipital intracerebral contusions and multiple skull base fractures. The patient was transferred to our hospital, and the DSA examination confirmed a carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) at the right ICA. A pseudoaneurysm 6.4 × 8.7 mm was also identified at the cavernous segment of the right ICA ().\nThe procedure was performed under general anesthesia after whole body heparinization. A 6-French guide catheter was selectively inserted into the internal carotid artery via the femoral artery. Using the methods described for patient 13, a Willis covered stent (4 × 16 mm, MicroPort) was first placed over the orifice of the fistula (), and immediate angiography confirmed correct placement of the stent, intact blood flow of the ICA and satisfactory occlusion of the fistula (). Then, with the guidance of a digital road map, a stent microcatheter (RebarTM-027, ev3) was advanced to the parent artery of the pseudoaneurysm. With the aneurysm embolization microcatheter (EchelonTM-10, ev3) carefully placed into the aneurysm cavity with the guidance of a 0.014-in microguidewire (TransendTM-300, Boston Scientific), the first coil (8 × 30 mm, Jasper) was released into the aneurysm. Then, a stent (SOLITAIRETM AB-6-20, ev3) was positioned with a microcatheter and released to fully cover the aneurysm neck (). After that, further aneurysm occlusion with detachable coils was then performed using standard procedures. Immediate angiography confirmed the complete embolization of the pseudoaneurysm (), and after the procedure, the patient was given heparin for 2 days followed by oral administration of aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 3 months."
"A 25-year-old male presented to emergency with a history of metallic ring stuck at the base of penis following insertion for sexual pleasure, two hours after the incident (Figure ). Initially, he was admitted to the urology department and was posted for its removal. Help was sought when they failed to remove it after their best efforts. The ring was approximately 1 cm wide and 0.25 cm thick and was made up of gold-plated platinum. The penis was swollen with a constriction at the base. The venous prominence was seen distal to the constriction ring. Mild edema at the glans penis was noted. The first attempt was made to cut the ring using a motorized cutting tool used in orthopedics. However, the speed and size of the saw were worrisome and there was every possibility of damaging the underlying soft tissue due to its high speed. Hence, this attempt was abandoned.\nThe second attempt was made using a Bard-Parker (BP) handle (Figure ) and a jumbo cutter (Figure ). This technique was fairly simple, as we passed the reverse end of the BP handle between the metallic ring and soft tissue at the base of the penis. The jumbo cutter was used to cut the ring over it. The advantage of using the reverse end of the BP handle blade was to ensure the prevention of soft tissue damage as one stabilizes it, while the other person can use a considerable amount of force over the jumbo cutter. After cutting the ring, the ends were opened out (Figure ) using nose pliers and the penis was freed with minimal soft tissue damage (Figure ) within an hour of emergency posting. The venous engorgement was quickly subsided and edema subsided after an hour.\nThe case was followed up in urology OPD at regular intervals. At follow-up one year later, the penis showed complete healing of ventral skin abrasions and no residual constriction (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old male electrician with a history of chronic smoking arrived at the ED due to electrocution at work. The patient was immediately resuscitated with CPR by coworkers. Emergency medical services (EMS) arrived and continued CPR until they achieved ROSC after 10 minutes. The patient arrived at the hospital intubated with a GCS of 3T. On physical examination, there was an electrical burn over the left shoulder and an abrasion over the forehead. All the trauma workup were negative, including head CT, MRI, and EEG. The hypothermia protocol was immediately initiated at 33°C for 18 hours followed by progesterone 100 mg every 12 hours for 72 hours. After the hypothermia protocol, the patient was extubated on hospital day 4. The patient was assessed neurologically, and he was found to have a GCS of 15 with motor and sensory abilities fully intact. Common psychoanalysis was performed immediately after extubation, two weeks, two months, and six months over the phone. The patient showed full emotional and functional recovery after hospital discharge."
"A 25 year old male presented with severe headache, arthralgia, abdominal pain, dizziness, fatigue and loss of appetite for a one month period. Initial symptoms were body pain, arthralgia and fatigue, which appeared four days after consuming the raw flesh of the lizard. Admission diagnosis was meningitis. Upon examination he had papilledema, hence LP was not performed. CT-scan was normal. Following treatment with albendazole and steroids as per case 1, improvements were seen after three days, at which point the patient returned home (day 34) and switched to oral prednisolone."
"A 25-year-old female, reporting no past medical history, presents to the emergency department with a one-week history of recurrent right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain. She describes three episodes of non-bloody diarrhea in the morning. She denies fevers, nausea, vomiting, or prandial/postprandial pain. She has no personal or family history of cancer or autoimmune diseases.\nOn physical exam, vitals are significant for fever to 100.9°F. The abdomen is soft, mildly distended, moderately tender to palpation in the RLQ, and without rebound tenderness. Initial lab work was remarkable for microcytic anemia with hemoglobin (Hgb) to 10, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 76, leukocytosis to 12.32, absolute neutrophil count 1196 (2.10-7.60 x 103 cells/μL), lactate 1.1, and HIV-negative. The clinical picture was concerning for appendicitis. CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrated inflammatory thickening of the cecum (Figures , ). The patient was admitted to general surgery for conservative management with bowel rest, intravenous (IV) Zosyn, and pain management. The patient improved and was discharged home on oral antibiotics. During her primary care follow-up visit, the patient endorsed the resolution of her symptoms."
"Patient 3 is a 25-year-old female diagnosed with OI type III with weight and body height deficiency, both below third centile. She has sustained about 20 fractures and is currently using a wheelchair. She presents features characteristic of the progressively deforming type, including shortening of lower extremities, barrel-shaped chest, disproportionately large head, triangular-shaped face, blue sclera, and DI. Pamidronate treatment started at the age of 15 years. The patient was found to harbor a novel c.1667G>T (p.Gly556Val) mutation in the COL1A2 gene. The patient has a negative family history and healthy siblings. The mutation was not found in the mother by Sanger sequencing; however, as no DNA sample was available from the father, we can only suspect the de novo appearance of the mutation."
"A 25-year-old female presented with intermittent fever and cough for 3 weeks with increasing breathlessness for 2 days. HRCT thorax & RT-PCR for COVID-19 were performed.\nHRCT thorax revealed multiple tiny nodular opacities with associated patchy areas of consolidation in bilateral lung parenchyma with upper lobe predominance- more in right upper lobe (A,B,C). Mild bronchiectatic changes were also noted in right upper lobe (B). Ill-defined areas of ground glass opacification were seen in bilateral lower lobes (D). Initial imaging diagnosis on HRCT thorax findings was given as pulmonary TB. Sputum smear microscopy showed acid fast bacilli (AFB). However, RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive, suggesting viral nature of the ground glass opacities in lower lobes.\nPatient was commenced on first line anti-tuberculous drugs along with supportive treatment and oxygen therapy for COVID-19 infection. She was discharged after 1 week and advised to continue follow-up at the outpatient department and the Directly Observed Therapy, Short-Course (DOTS) center."
"P5 is a 25-year-old female with APDS1 (p.E1021K). She has suffered from RTI since 12 months (common pathogens and Candida albicans) necessitating early insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy for hearing impairment. At 2.5 years of age, she was hospitalized for EBV infection with marked hepatosplenomegaly and diffuse lymphadenopathy. At 5 years, autoimmune thyroiditis was diagnosed. At 8 years, tonsillectomy and cervical lymphadenectomy were performed, showing atypical but polyclonal lymphoproliferation with EBV positivity. Later, chronic lobar atelectasis, underlaid by pronounced bronchial lymphonodular hyperplasia, and bronchiectasis were noted, manifesting as chronic cough and steroid-resistant mixed ventilatory impairment. At 25 years, she was found to have positive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies, while unaware of any past symptoms of the disease.\nP5 was evaluated by an immunologist for the first time at 10 years of age. Low IgG and increased IgM were noted. By 20 years of age, her immunophenotype was disease characteristic, and the diagnosis of APDS was established. She had a persistent anti-EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG and IgM positivity but absent Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA) IgG.\nIgRT and prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole and itraconazole were started at 8 years of age, partially reducing the frequency of RTI and lymphoproliferation. Upon the diagnosis of APDS at 21 years, rapamycin was started, further ameliorating the infectious susceptibility and lymphoproliferation. At 23 years of age, she entered a clinical study with PI3K inhibitor leniolisib.\nP5 is of normal intellect, achieved high school education, and currently works as a receptionist."
"A 25-year-old male presented with complaints of a small painful swelling over the dorsum of the right foot for the past one year. There was no antecedent history of any trauma/ similar swellings elsewhere in the body neither was there any history of an increase in the size of the swelling. Aspiration was attempted from the swelling in another hospital but was not successful. Examination revealed a 2-cm, mobile, non-compressible, soft, tender swelling over the mid-dorsum of right mid-foot just proximal to the level of tarsometatarsal joints. Tinel’s sign was negative giving a clinical suspicion of a ganglion cyst. Visual analog score (VAS) was 6/10. There was no gait abnormality observed. Ultrasonography of the right foot demonstrated a soft tissue hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement simulating a ganglion cyst; however, continuity of adjacent nerve fibers also gave a differential diagnosis of PNST. In view of the conflicting ultrasonographic and clinical findings, unavailability of MRI, and persistent symptoms, an excisional biopsy was planned. Upon giving incision in the superficial fascia, a smooth shiny bulbous mass was visualized in continuity with medial dorsal cutaneous nerve; careful excision of the mass was done maintaining the continuity of the nerve fibers. The clinical and intra-operative pictures of the swelling have been described in Figures -.\nThe histopathology revealed an encapsulated mass showing an admix of myxoid hypocellular (Antoni B) and hypercellular areas (Antoni A) with nuclear palisading (Verocay bodies), confirming the diagnosis of benign schwannoma (Figures -).\nThe patient’s symptoms were completely resolved after the surgery, and he resumed his normal activities from the next day. There was no neural deficit or any other complication noted after the excision. At the last follow-up of one year, the patient was pain-free (VAS 0) with no evidence of recurrence. Consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this manuscript."
"Ms R, a 25-year-old lady with a four-year history of ESRD and secondary hyperparathyroidism, initially presented with right Garden 2 NOF fracture after a trivial injury (Figure ). Surgical intervention was postponed due to unavoidable circumstances (Figure ). One month later, she presented with contralateral hip pain despite no recent history of trauma or fall. Plain radiographs and computed tomography of the hip both revealed an undisplaced Garden 1 NOF fracture of the left femur (Figure ). Her bone mineral density (BMD) had a Z-score of -4.2 which showed severe osteoporosis and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was markedly raised (2593 pg/ml).\nThe patient was referred to an endocrine surgeon and she underwent a total parathyroidectomy. The iPTH level dropped drastically post parathyroidectomy (<0.3 pg/ml) and her BMD showed significant improvement (Z-score -3.0). Subsequently, a bipolar hemiarthroplasty was done for her right hip (Figure ) while the left neck of femur fracture was fixed with cannulated screws (Figure ). She was able to ambulate with a walking frame two days post-operatively with full weight-bearing on her right leg. After a period of rehabilitation, she was able to ambulate without support. There was no complication at one year post-operation."
"A 25-year-old healthy woman presented complaining of distortion and a blind spot near the central vision of her left eye of one month duration. One week preceding visual symptom onset, she endorsed night sweats, headache, and new-onset anosmia. The night sweats and headaches lasted 3 days. The anosmia lasted 2 weeks. She had multiple confirmed ill COVID-19 contacts at her workplace before the onset of her symptoms. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 and 20/25 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Intraocular pressures, previously documented as normal, were 20 mmHg on the right and 24 mmHg on the left after one month of topical difluprednate therapy. The anterior chambers were both quiet with no cell or flare. Examination of the vitreous revealed rare cell and no haze in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed placoid lesions in the macula and midperiphery of both eyes. Peripheral punched-out scars with Schlaegel lines were also noted. Fundus imaging () demonstrated hypoautofluorescent lesions in the macula and midperiphery of both eyes with irregular hyperautofluorescent borders. Hypofluorescent lesions were observed on indocyanine green angiography in a distribution more widespread in the left eye than appreciated on fundus examination. Fluorescein angiography (FA) demonstrated early progressive staining and leakage from the placoid lesions without significant early blockage. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated bilateral outer retinal disruption (). Laboratory evaluation was negative for QuantiFERON-TB gold, HIV, and syphilis antibodies. COVID-19 antibody testing returned positive for IgG. COVID-19 PCR testing was not performed. The patient's systemic symptoms had occurred 4 months following the initial pandemic lockdowns in the United States when the patient's county of origin had reported a total of 450-460 cases per 100,000 inhabitants []. Neuroimaging was not pursued due to the resolution of headaches and absence of neurologic symptoms at the time of evaluation. She was treated with a taper of oral prednisone starting at 60 mg. The retinal lesions did not progress, and steroid-sparing therapy with azathioprine (1.5 mg/kg) was initiated at 3 weeks. Visual acuity remained 20/20 in both eyes at 10-month follow-up after completing a 3-month oral prednisone taper and continuing azathioprine."
"A 25-year-old Hispanic female presented to the emergency department (ED) with two weeks of waxing and waning right-sided flank pain. She described the pain as a cramping discomfort that worsened over the two weeks and was only mildly relieved by acetaminophen. She also reported urinary frequency and urgency without dysuria or hematuria. Physical examination was notable for right upper quadrant and mild right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis showed nitrite negative, leukocyte esterase positive urine with 685 white blood cells per high power field, 53 red blood cells per high power field, and appreciable bacteria. A computed tomography (CT) from the ED revealed a right staghorn calculus with hydronephrosis along with left nephrolithiasis (, )."
"A 25-year-old male patient was referred to the cytopathology outpatient department for FNAC from swelling on the left elbow. He gave a history of trauma three years back and as a result, a clinical diagnosis of hematoma was made. Multiple swellings on the left big toe, right ankle, and third fingers of both hands were shortly noticed after the initial complaint of swelling on the left elbow. The swellings did not respond to immobilization, physical therapy, or prolonged rest nor did they subside with medications and gradually increased in size. He also complained of occasional episodes of dull aching pain which was aggravated on movement. There was no family history of joint disease and systemic illnesses. He reported occasional alcohol use and had no history of renal disease. On clinical examination, there was an approximately 5×4cm swelling over the dorsal aspect of the left elbow (Figure ), which was well defined, immobile, firm to hard in consistency, and non-tender. Further examination revealed multiple swellings on the metatarsophalangeal joint of the right foot (Figure ), left lateral malleolus (Figure ) and third interphalangeal joints of both right hand (Figure ) and left hand (Figure ) similar to the above description.\nPlain radiographs (Figure ) revealed increased soft tissue thickness of the dorsal aspect of the left elbow measuring 2.4 x 1 x 1.6 cm and similar soft tissue mass in the right foot with minimal distal acoustic enhancement measuring 3.4 x 4.4 x 2.5 cm. Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings revealed large periarticular soft tissue around the first metatarsophalangeal joint involving the head and distal shaft of the first metatarsal and proximal phalanx with minimal intraarticular extension of the soft tissue causing large erosions of the head of the first metatarsal bone. In laboratory investigations, blood chemistry revealed leukocytosis 17.900/cumm, serum uric acid levels of 7.2mg/dl (normal range 3.5-7.2mg/dl), serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, mildly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and mild anemia.\nFine-needle aspiration from the swellings yielded thick chalky white aspirate. Cytopathology smears prepared from the aspirate examined showed abundant small needle-shaped crystals in a blood-mixed amorphous background (Figure ).\nOn examination of Leishman-stained cyto-smears with a polarizing microscope, the needle-shape crystals were negatively birefringent consistent with monosodium urate crystals (Figure ).\nOn the basis of these findings, a diagnosis of polyarticular tophaceous gout was rendered. The patient was undergoing treatment with Department of Rheumatology on the conservative line but was lost to follow-up after few visits in the outpatient department."
"A 25-year-old Bahraini female presented to the eye clinic with blurring of vision in the upper field of her right eye of four days duration. There was no history of preceding febrile illness, immunization, trauma, or any past systemic or neurological disease or any medications. Her past ocular history included laser correction in both the eyes for a mild myopic refractive error four years ago. There was no significant family history. Her visual acuity on presentation was 6/6 in each eye. Ishihara test revealed a mildly impaired color vision in the right eye and fully normal color vision in the left eye. Ocular movements showed a full range but were associated with some pain on supraduction of the right eye.\nAnterior segment and adnexal examinations were unremarkable. A relative afferent pupillary defect grade two was noted in the right eye. Fundus examination revealed normal-looking optic disc, retinal and vasculature details. Her visual field plot, 24-2 on Humphrey’s field analyzer, revealed in the right eye a superior altitudinal visual field defect (Figure ). The fellow eye showed a normal field plot. Optical coherence tomography and B scan ultrasonography of the optic discs revealed no abnormalities.\nSystemic evaluation including full neurological evaluation and ENT status were within normal limits. Brain and orbit MRI scans were unremarkable. Blood investigations including full blood count, renal function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum folate and B 12 levels were all also within normal. Serum autoimmune markers such as anti-cardiolipin antibodies, antinuclear antibody (ANA) screen and double-stranded DNA were also within normal range. Serological infective screening that included TP-antibody for syphilis, anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV AB/AG combo and hepatitis B surface antigen were all non-reactive. Serum anti-aquapore-4 antibody test also returned negative. Electrophysiological study of visual-evoked cortical potential (VEP) revealed delayed latencies suggestive of optic neuritis.\nTwo days after the presentation, her visual acuity deteriorated to 6/15 at which point she was started on a five-day course of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 gm daily under the care of a neurophysician. On her review four days after the completion of the treatment, that is on the 11th day from the initial presentation, she was noted to have total recovery of the visual acuity, full restoration of the color vision on Ishihara’s testing and complete disappearance of the altitudinal field defect on Humphrey’s perimetry (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old male with no known prior health problems presented to the emergency department 3 days after receiving his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine with chest pain and dyspnea. A 12-lead ECG showed diffuse PR segment depression and PR segment elevation in lead aVR, consistent with acute pericarditis. On admission, the serum cardiac troponin was elevated at 17 pg/ml and the serum C-reactive protein was elevated at 96 mg/dl. SARS COVID-19 PCR testing, other viral serologies, and bacterial testing were all negative. TTE showed an LVEF of 60% and no pericardial effusion. The patient was diagnosed with acute myopericarditis, treated with colchicine, and was discharged home in stable clinical condition. CMR performed 1 week after hospital discharge showed subepicardial LGE and myocardial edema in the lateral LV segments. GLS by TTE and CMR was normal (< −18%)."
"A 25-year-old girl was transferred to our department for the right chemosis for 7 days after a vehicle accident. She was diagnosed with right CCF by a six-vessel angiography. The fistula was successfully repaired with 1 Willis covered stent. At 1-month follow-up, the right chemosis disappeared with no new neurological deficits. Angiographic follow-up 6 months after discharge showed patency of the parent artery with no stenosis (Fig. ). Clinical follow-up 6 and 24 months after initial discharge showed no neurological deficit."
"A 25-year-old male with end-stage CF with genotype F508del/F508del presented to the clinic complaining of chronic bilateral knee and ankle pain. He had severe lung disease with forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) 19% predicted. He had previously undergone a childhood liver transplant for CF liver disease and remained on tacrolimus. He also had CF-related diabetes, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition. His current medications included dornase alfa, albuterol MDI prn, and pancreatic enzymes, however, he was not on a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator at the time. The patient resided in rural Maine although he denied any recent insect bites. He was not sexually active at the time of his initial presentation.\nOn physical examination at his initial presentation, his vitals were within normal limits (temp 36.6°C, HR 105, BP 118/74, SpO2 91%). He was found to have swelling of bilateral knees as well as pain on flexion and extension of the wrists and ankles. None of his affected joints were erythematous or warm. He had no joint deformities and no frozen joints. He had grade 3 clubbing in his hands bilaterally (Figure ).\nHe was started empirically on 10 mg prednisone for a suspected diagnosis of CF arthropathy and was given ibuprofen and tramadol for pain relief. He had improvement in his joint swelling but continued to have frequent joint pain. At a follow-up visit, prednisone was decreased to 5 mg due to hyperglycemia and he was started on highly effective modulator therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta®). A whole-body bone scan was obtained (Figure ). The bone scan showed evidence of periostosis and thus the diagnosis of HPOA was made."
"A 25-year-old woman in immediate puerperium was admitted to the hospital with proximal weakness that has been increasing progressively until difficulty in mobility and subsequent prostration that occurs seven hours after cesarean.\nThere were no personal or family history diseases, current medications include ferrous sulfate, and she denied alcohol or recreational drugs. She had one previous pregnancy without complication. This pregnancy was normal, and a cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks for pelvic dystocia.\nOn physical examination, she was alert and oriented, and her vital signs were normal in the neurological examination with findings of proximal weakness, without alteration in the tendon reflexes and findings of alteration in long tracts or focal neurologic deficit.\nInitial laboratory showed normal blood cell counts, severe hypokalemia (potassium, 1.91 mEq/L), and pH of 7.24, bicarbonate at 7.7 mmol/L with normal plasma anion gap (anion GAP: 12, 5 mEq/L) .\nUrine studies showed urinalysis was normal with a pH of 6.5, without urine active sediment. Urinary K: Cr 83.7 mEq/g, urinary anion gap: 24 mmol/L, and urinary osmolar gap is positive .\nSerologic testing was negative for autoimmune causes.\nA renal ultrasound revealed normal-sized kidneys with marked increase in the echogenicity in the region of the renal pyramids bilaterally and symmetric consistent with nephrocalcinosis.\nTreatment: She received potassium chloride initial by the peripheral vein, and 6 hours after admission, his serum potassium level increased to 2.1 mEq/L with improvement of weakness."
"A 25-year-old man, without any particular pathological history, victim of a firearm assault two years before his admission, during an attempted arrest, causing penetrating wounds of the face by projections of lead-based bullets.The patient had local care and extraction of some foreign bodies, but without an initial radiological workup including CT and/or X-ray. Two years later, the patient complained of pain in the chin and forehead area, which motivated him to consult our department. The clinical examination revealed scarring in the chin and left frontal area (A), sensitive to palpation, with perception of a mass in the subcutaneous area opposite the two scars, hard, mobile in the deep plane, attached to the remaining metal projectiles. A CT scan was requested this time, which confirmed the presence of metallic foreign bodies in the soft tissues coming into contact with the bone, without any bony continuity, at the right frontal level and at the symphyseal level (B). However, the patient had no clinical signs of lead poisoning. After informed and written consent from the parents, he underwent extraction of these metallic foreign bodies under general anesthesia (). Intraoperatively, they were really ballistic projectiles (). We performed a frontal approach using the old frontal scar, and a lower vestibular endobuccal approach ().\nThe postoperative period was favourable, without complications, with medical treatment based on antibiotics (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid: 80mg/kg/day in 3 doses) and analgesics (paracetamol: 15mg/kg/day every 6 hours). Follow-up at the post-discharge consultation was done at 15 days, then 1,3 and 6 months later, without any complications being objectified."
"A 25-year-old male, seeking medical assistance after identifying testicular lumps on self-examination was diagnosed with a testicular tumour. Concerned about fertility preservation, the physician ordered a semen analysis, which showed azoospermia. The patient was referred to a male infertility centre and after shared decision-making, it was decided to proceed with onco-TESE. As soon as the testicular tissue was obtained, we proceeded with shredding and fine mincing of the tissue with rupture of the STs. The suspension was assessed under an inverted microscope and no sperm was identified. It was decided to proceed with incubation of the pelleted testicular suspension with collagenase IV for 1 h. The digested solution was centrifuged, and supernatant cell suspension was washed with buffered medium, and the pellet was assessed by droplets under oil and rare sperm were identified. The formed pellet was placed into heated culture medium micro-drops in a Petri dish, covered by oil, and in the same plate we placed SpermVD (Sperm VD assisted reproduction device, developed by MFC global) device to perform sperm vitrification, as described by Berkovitz et al. [].\nDue to the very low count of sperm, vitrification was the technique of choice for cryopreservation. Approximately 10 spermatozoa were placed in each well of the device with the aid of an ICSI needle using an inverted microscope.\nAfter orchidectomy, this patient underwent chemotherapy and follow-up evaluations showed that the treatment was successful. After 5 years, the patient and his partner presented to the clinic again, seeking ART. After complete evaluation of the couple, it was decided to perform ICSI using the cryopreserved sperm, as semen analysis showed azoospermia. The frozen sample was thawed by removing the device from the liquid nitrogen and placing it in a Petri dish covered with heated oil. The sperm were removed from the SpermVD with the aid of an ICSI needle and the oocyte fertilisation procedure was performed."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a six-month history of liquid and solid dysphagia. The patient also referred to dyspnea episodes that he attributed to upper respiratory tract infections. He had no relevant past medical or familial history.\nFlexible laryngoscopy showed a lump in the postcricoid region of the hypopharynx, apparently reaching the right arytenoid cartilage and the right aryepiglottic fold, with bulging and decreased mobility of the ipsilateral hemilarynx.\nA CT (Figure ) showed a solid homogeneous submucosal lesion, with regular margins, and mild enhancement in the right postcricoid region of the hypopharynx. The right vocal cord was slightly medially deviated, although no cartilage erosion was seen.\nAn MRI (Figure ) was performed confirming a submucosal, well-circumscribed, solid lesion in the postcricoid region of the hypopharynx. On T1-weighted images, the lesion showed homogeneous isointense signal intensity relative to muscle, and on T2-weighted images, the lesion was slightly hyperintense to the muscle. After gadolinium administration, the lesion enhanced homogeneously and progressively. No altered signal intensity was seen on the surrounding cartilages.\nThe patient was submitted to a partial pharyngectomy with a carbon dioxide laser.\nMacroscopically, multiple reddish lesion fragments were observed and submitted in total for microscopic evaluation.\nHistopathology (Figure ) revealed an unencapsulated lesion composed of bland spindle cells, immature elongated cells with bipolar cytoplasmic extensions, and strap-type rhabdomyoblasts with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round vesicular nuclei displaying a fascicular growth pattern. Cross striations were easily identifiable. No pleomorphism, necrosis, or atypical mitoses were observed. The tumor cells showed strong cytoplasmic staining for desmin and multifocal myogenin and myogenic differentiation antigen 1 (MYOD1) expression.\nThe final diagnosis was an intermediate (juvenile) fetal rhabdomyoma.\nAfter an initial six-month follow-up, a 12-month re-examination showed no relevant symptoms, although MRI exhibited what appears to be a persistence of the hypopharyngeal lesion. The multidisciplinary team decided to maintain a short-term follow-up."
"The third case is a 25-year-old HIV-negative male patient who was diagnosed with RR-TB and initiated on levofloxacin-kanamycin-delamanid-linezolid-clofazimine. The baseline QTcF-interval was 421 msec but prolonged to 518 msec after 23 days of treatment. No laboratory abnormality was identified and he was not taking any concomitant medications thought to prolong the QT-Interval as well, so, clofazimine was stopped and ECG monitoring continued. The ECG repeated after a week recorded a sinus rhythm with QTcF 463 msec. Monthly ECG recordings were done for the rest of patient’s treatment course and no ECG above 500 msec was recorded then after."
"A 25-year-old male with no remarkable previous medical history was admitted exhibiting gangrenous changes on his right cheek 6 days after receiving HA injection (1 mL, 27-G needle) for the treatment of acne scars. He reported noticing skin changes after the filler injection without realizing the problem until the sixth day after treatment. The treating clinician had performed needling and hyaluronidase injection into the entire gangrenous area before the patient was urgently transferred to our emergency department. His lesion was judged to be a complication of inadvertent intravascular injection of the filler, and LDI was performed the following day. Although his appearance and photographs revealed a large gangrenous area, LDI merely revealed several small perfusion defects on the right cheek. Needling was performed only in the areas where LDI showed perfusion defects. PGE1, steroids, and antibiotics were administered as ancillary therapy. LDI was repeated on the third day after admission, and the perfusion defects were confirmed to have resolved completely. However, remnants of sporadic skin erosion were evident on visual and photographic examinations of the right cheek. The patient was discharged with a 1-week prescription of cilostazol and antibiotics. During follow-up visits 4 weeks after discharge, the wound was found to be healing, leaving only a small scar and PIH ()."
"A 25-year-old male patient with no known comorbidity was admitted with complaints of low-grade fever since 7 days along with shortness of breath for 3 days. In the emergency department, the patient had oxygen saturation of 70% at room air, which improved to 94% on NIV (FiO2: 0.7, PEEP: 7, PS: 10). HRCT revealed CTSS of 37/40 with ground-glass opacity. Subsequently, the patient was intubated on day 7 of hospitalization. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed no features of pulmonary embolism; however, mild pneumopericardium was observed, which was managed conservatively (). Owing to the worsening of his illness, he succumbed on day 24."
"A 25-year-old African-American female presented with a three-year history of enlarging growths in the periumbilical region. The growths originally began as small subtle bumps under the skin and slowly enlarged over time. They were not tender to palpation but were occasionally painful with movement and during menstrual cycles. Physical examination revealed two flesh-colored, ~2.0 x 2.5 cm rubbery, non-tender, mobile, well-circumscribed and non-reducible nodules that appeared confined to the subcutaneous tissue (Figure ). The remainder of the patient’s physical examination and review of systems was negative.\nExcisional biopsy of a periumbilical lesion revealed a well-circumscribed neoplasm comprised of stromal fibrosis and glandular epithelial hyperplasia in a pericanalicular to primarily intracanalicular pattern, with no evidence of stromal or epithelial dysplasia/atypia (Figure ).\nThe patient's histopathological and clinical findings were most consistent with a diagnosis of ectopic cutaneous fibroadenomas."
"A 25-year-old woman with an unremarkable past medical history (PMH) underwent drive-through testing for COVID-19 after experiencing low-grade fever, muscle pain, a mild headache, and hyposmia. The nasal swab sample was collected on day 6 after symptom onset, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient did not seek medical attention or self-medicate. On day 10 after symptom onset, her symptoms had cleared, with the exception of hyposmia that lasted until day 14 before resolving fully.\nThe woman went on to visit a health clinic nine weeks after recovering from this episode, at which time she reported a perturbation to her sense of taste. Her chief complaint was that cola-flavored soft drinks did not feel the same as she remembered. She likened the flavor of certain carbonated sodas to that of “drinking perfume” and “tasting rubbing alcohol”. The patient was unable to pinpoint the day she had started to notice these symptoms. The flavor of other beverages, including non-cola-flavored sodas, would feel the same way as she remembered. The patient had not become aware of any disturbances in chemesthetic or olfactory function. She was referred to an otolaryngologist for specialist management."
"A 25-year-old man was referred to our hospital in March 2013 with anterior chamber inflammation, vitreous opacity, and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in his left eye. Over the previous five months, he had been admitted to a local hospital with cataract and vitreous hemorrhage in the left eye and underwent combined phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation and vitrectomy. However, there was no significant improvement in his left eye. His medical history included a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) based on immunohistochemistry of a brain biopsy in March 2010. He noted that he had completed seven courses of chemotherapy [methotrexate (MTX), vincristine, ifosfamide, and dexamethasone] followed by one course of brain radiotherapy a period of 19 months. The volume of the brain lesions decreased significantly.\nOur ophthalmological examination revealed an elevated IOP (34.1 mmHg, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), anterior chamber reaction (keratic precipitates 1+, flare 1+, cell 1+) (), vitreous opacity and a plurality of white lumps on the surface of the inferior retina in the left eye. While there were no significant lesions in the fundus. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/16 and 20/200 in his right and left eyes, respectively. B-scan revealed vitreous opacity and epiretinal deposits, and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) found a ciliary body mass with almost 360° involvement in the left eye ().\nDiagnostic vitrectomy was performed in the left eye on April 15th, 2013. Liquid-based cytology revealed large atypical lymphoid cells that were CD20+ on flow cytometry ( and ). Brain magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow were insignificant. The patient received ocular intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT, 45 Gy) and a series of 0.4 mg MTX intravitreal injections (weekly for the first month, every 2 weeks for the second month, and monthly for 10 months). After one-month treatment with 4 intravitreal injections of MTX, his condition was assessed again. His BCVA improved to 20/40, the IOP was reduced to 16 mmHg, and the anterior inflammation disappeared in the left eye. UBM reexamination showed complete regression of the ciliary body lesions. Then, the patient completed remained 12 intravitreal injections of MTX, and there was no recurrence of the intraocular lymphoma during the one-year follow-up period."
"This case describes a 25-year-old female with a family history of HAE, who was diagnosed with type 1 HAE when she was 4 years old and for whom the onset of HAE symptoms occurred at 12 years of age. She had previously received IV-C1-INH (Cinryze) for long-term prophylaxis, before switching to biweekly lanadelumab monotherapy, which she received for 15 months prior to her enrollment in the APeX-S study in 2020. In the 6 months leading up to study enrollment, the patient experienced an average of 2 HAE attacks per month with lanadelumab prophylaxis.\nAfter starting oral berotralstat, the patient continued self-administration of biweekly lanadelumab for one month before it was discontinued (Fig. ). The patient experienced two HAE attacks during this 4-week dual therapy phase, both requiring icatibant treatment. In the first 2.5 months of berotralstat monotherapy, the patient did not experience any HAE attacks, but 3 attacks occurred in the subsequent 2 weeks, two of which were self-assessed as mild and the other as moderate in severity. Two of these attacks were triggered by physical activity, and no identifiable trigger was reported for the third. All three attacks required icatibant treatment. Regardless, the patient’s attack rate during the 3 months of treatment with berotralstat monotherapy was lower than during the 6 months of lanadelumab monotherapy prior to study entry. No treatment-related adverse events were identified while she received berotralstat. Her level of satisfaction with this treatment was excellent at all time points; however, she is no longer enrolled in the study for personal reasons."
"A previously healthy nulliparous 25-year-old woman presented to a peripheral community hospital with new-onset right-sided twitching, generalized tonic–clonic seizures, confusion and hallucinations. CT imaging of the head was negative for structural abnormalities, while US imaging of the pelvis revealed a mass associated with the left ovary. Initial treatment with phenytoin, propofol, valproic acid and clobazam was ineffective and necessitated patient transfer to TWH. Upon arrival, the patient exhibited irregular movement of all limbs and non-purposeful eye movements as well as lip smacking and chewing motions which were initially managed with clonazepam and clonidine. CT and MRI studies of the brain did not reveal structural lesions nor parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural enhancement. The patient was intubated and, shortly thereafter, luxated the right maxillary and mandibular central and lateral incisors resulting in marked hemorrhage requiring consultation with the OMFS service (Fig. a). After the extraction of the extremely mobile dentition, a tracheostomy was performed with installation of our oral appliance to mitigate further oral and maxillofacial trauma (Fig. b, c). Repeat US demonstrated a 1.8 centimeter (cm) × 1.8 cm × 1.8 cm hypoechoic lesion associated with the left ovary suspicious for an ovarian teratoma. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were demonstrated within the CSF confirming the diagnosis of anti-NMDARE. The patient underwent a left laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy with histopathology revealing a mature teratoma associated with the left ovary. Unfortunately, the patient continued to deteriorate despite medical and surgical management including several courses of IVIG, PLEX, intravenous steroids, rituximab and a laparoscopic right salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathology noted the presence of several cystic follicles and a benign simple cyst with no identifiable neural tissue or teratoma associated with the right ovary. Three months following her original hospital admission, dyskinetic movements and seizures terminated and the patient began to breathe spontaneously. The oral appliance was subsequently removed and the patient was eventually transferred to the neurology ward in stable condition where no further intervention or follow-up by the OMFS service was required. A review of the discharge MRI which captured the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) regions revealed an absence of osseous degeneration of the articulating components of the joints and no discernible disc abnormalities secondary to prolonged oral appliance use (Fig. a–d)."
"Subject one is a 25-year-old man with no chronic medical condition, prior nasal or oral conditions, or recognized risk factors for anosmia or ageusia, who developed acute onset headache, chest tightness, lower extremity and extraocular myalgias, fever, and fatigue on day one. All symptoms were rated as mild in intensity. Symptoms were associated with total ageusia and anosmia, with taste and smell self-reported as 1/10 in intensity, where one is no taste or smell whatsoever, and ten is normal, unmitigated taste and smell. While most symptoms resolved on day five, anosmia and ageusia persisted without improvement for 46 days. He tested positive for COVID-19 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on day 15. Oral aspirin, diphenhydramine, prednisone, and famotidine taken early in the course of infection provided no relief. On day 46, the subject ingested a capsule supplement containing 1000 mg of turmeric extract (95% curcuminoids) and 10 mg of black pepper extract. He experienced complete restoration of smell and taste, with both senses rated 10/10, ten minutes after supplement ingestion.\nSubject two is a 28-year-old man with mild intermittent asthma, but no other prior nasal or oral conditions, or recognized risk factors for anosmia or ageusia, who developed acute onset of chest tightness, fever, headache, nausea, and knee arthralgias, rated as mild in intensity, on day one. Three days later, he developed near-anosmia and ageusia with both senses, respectively, rated as 2/10 and 1/10 in intensity. On day one, he tested positive for COVID-19 via PCR testing. On day two, he started a daily regimen of azithromycin, vitamin D, vitamin C, quercetin, zinc, and dexamethasone. These medications failed to restore any measure of taste or smell. On day four, he took a single dose of a capsule supplement containing 1000 mg of turmeric extract (95% curcuminoids), 1000 mg of Boswellia serrata plant extract, and 15 mg of black pepper extract for the first time. Twelve hours after taking the turmeric supplement, the subject reported experiencing a restoration of both smell and taste to intensity of 6/10 each, with 10/10 being achieved three days later. His other symptoms of chest tightness, fever, headache, nausea, and arthralgia persisted unabated until day nine."
"Case 5, the last patient, was a 25-year-old man with a long-standing history of Tourette syndrome. He was presented to our hospital in 2016. Before DBS surgery, he was 178 cm tall, weighed 87 kg, and had a body mass index of 27.4 kg/m2. Bilateral globus pallidus internus was selected as the DBS target. Subsequently, the Activa RC was implanted in the right sub-clavicular pocket. In 2019, 3 years after the implantation of the DBS system, he began to experience difficulties with charging his r-IPG. He complained of extensive charging time and reduced charging efficiency. When he visited our hospital the second time, he weighed 106 kg and had a body mass index of 33.4 kg/m2 (a body mass index >30 kg/m2 is classified as obese). The r-IPG was in good position on chest X-ray examination (). Revision surgery was then undertaken. During the operation, we found that the thickness of his thoracic subcutaneous fat layer was approximately 2 cm (). We removed the r-IPG from the subcutaneous pocket and achieved good connection between the charger and the r-IPG. A shallower pocket, 1 cm underneath the skin surface, was created to accommodate the r-IPG. The charging capability of the r-IPG was restored without complications to date."
"A 25-year-old Iranian man presented with symptoms and signs of Cushing’s syndrome (weight gain, proximal muscle weakness, abdominal purplish striae, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and fragility fractures in thoracic and lumbar spines due to osteoporosis; Z score-5.1 in the lumbar area). An endocrine evaluation showed corticotropin-dependent hypercortisolism (ACTH level was 250 pg/ml). Pituitary MRI revealed a microadenoma 5 × 9 mm. Because of the unavailability of facilities to perform inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS), the patient underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Three months later, hypercortisolism persisted. An ectopic source could not be localized. The whole-body CT scan was unremarkable. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Four year later, follow-up chest CT scan revealed a 17 × 11 mm mass in the posterior basal segment of the right lung. Whole-body scan and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) with Tc99m Octreotide (HYNIC-Toc) showed abnormal focal somatostatin receptors analog avid lesion in the posterior aspect of inferior third of right lung, highly suggestive of ectopic ACTH-producing tumor (Fig. ). The patient underwent thoracotomy, and wedge resection of the right lower lobe was done. Histologic study of right lower lobe mass revealed neuroendocrine tumor that was well differentiated (consistent with carcinoid tumor), and IHC staining for VSE, Ki67, and chromogranin A was positive."
"Last case is a 25-year-old Saudi gentleman, non-smoker, known case of bronchial asthma (on ICS/LABA and montelukast) and allergic rhinitis (on intranasal steroids) presented in March 2017 with uncontrolled asthma symptoms despite receiving maximal asthma therapy and good compliance to treatment. He was complaining of dry cough, progressive dyspnea, and wheezes that were interfering with his daily activities and sleep. He denied fever, chest pain, and hemoptysis. A review of other systems was unremarkable. He had a history of turbinectomy and nasal polypectomy twice in the past 3 years.\nHis physical examination showed an obese man with the following vital signs: BP was 130/70 mmHg, PR 105 beats/minute, RR 24 breaths/minute, T 36.9 °C with SpO2 of 95% while breathing ambient air. His Cardiac examination was normal. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral equal air entry with generalized expiratory rhonchi. No skin rashes, arthritis, palpable lymphadenopathy, nor lower limb edema.\nInvestigations showed: hemoglobin of 16.8 g/L, WBC count of 10.1 × 109/L, eosinophils of 14% (1010 cells/μL), and serum IgE level of 1100 IU/mL. Aspergillus fumigatus IgE was positive (class 5). Liver function tests, renal function tests, and urine analysis, were normal. Chest x-ray was normal as well. CT chest showed bilateral bronchial wall thickening with central bronchiectasis ().\nHe was diagnosed with ABPA based on the clinical presentation (asthma), laboratory findings (high serum IgE, blood eosinophilia, and positive IgE for aspergillus), and radiological findings. He was on inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (ICS/LABA/LAMA), montelukast. Oral corticosteroids were added and gradually tapered to 5 mg daily over one month. This patient also failed to wean off steroids. He developed gastritis with recurrent helicobacter pylori infection and depression.\nIn March 2020 the patient received subcutaneous dupilumab 600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg maintenance dose every 2 weeks. Oral steroids were eventually discontinued. He was stable until March 2021. His physical examination was unremarkable other than generalized expiratory rhonchi. Follow-up investigations showed a normal chest x-ray and CT chest (). His eosinophils increased to 20.2% (2121 cells/μL) and his IgE was 350 IU/mL. His current medications are ICS/LABA/LAMA, montelukast, and dupilumab twice monthly. The FEV1 was 55% pretreatment and 78% post-treatment."
"A 25-year-old unmarried Hindu female student from Dharan, Nepal, was brought to the emergency department of BPKIHS on 24 December 2019 at 4 pm with a 2 hour history of facial twitching, slurred speech, and 24 hour history of abnormal tongue protrusion. There was no documented history of any drug allergies or other abnormal body movements. She also did not have any relatives with seizure disorders. On 23 December, her local physician prescribed oral tablet metoclopramide 10 mg three times a day for 7 days and tablet pantoprazole 40 mg once every day for 7 days to prevent gastric acid and basal acid secretion for acid peptic disease (APD). On examination, her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15, blood pressure 120/90 mmHg, pulse rate 102/min, and partial pressure oxygen saturation (SpO2) 99% on room air. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed potential of hydrogen (PH)of 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) at 31.1 mmHg; sodium ion (Na+) 140.3 mmol/L, potassium ion (K+) 3.87 mmol/L, concentration of hydrogen carbonate (HCO3−) 21.2 mmol/L. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale scored 6 and classified as a “probable” adverse drug reaction []. Metoclopramide-induced acute dystonic reaction was diagnosed, and she was triaged as Australasian Triage Score (ATS) 2. She was resuscitated right away with intravenous fluids, oxygen via face mask, and a 25 mg intravenous dose of chlorpheniramine. After 2 hours, the symptoms subsided, and she was able to return home the same day. The patient was recommended to stop taking metoclopramide in the future."
"A 25-year-old male with well-controlled Crohn's disease (not prescribed any medications) presented to the emergency department with chest pain. The chest pain began the day prior to presentation, worse with inspiration and with associated jaw pain. He reported that he received his second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech) four days prior to presentation. He experienced malaise and myalgias that resolved within twenty-four hours after receiving the vaccine. Labs were significant for a Troponin T that peaked at 0.74 ng/ml (reference < 0.2 ng/ml). Tick panel (for Lyme, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis) was negative since these are part of the differential work-up of myocarditis in the New England region of the United States. His electrocardiogram did not show any ischemic changes, and echocardiogram was significant for low normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%. He was admitted for further work-up and started on colchicine and ibuprofen for presumed myopericarditis. He underwent cardiac MRI which showed a left ventricular fraction of 56% and findings consistent with myocarditis with myocardial edema seen by T2 mapping and myocardial injury with focal late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with multiple foci in the midwall. He did not have evidence of pericardial inflammation. He did not undergo endomyocardial biopsy. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative. During his hospital stay, he was monitored on telemetry without any arrhythmias observed. He was discharged on low-dose beta-blocker with plans for repeat outpatient echocardiogram and cardiac monitor to screen for any arrhythmias as well as activity restriction."
"We report a case of a 25-year-old lady who presented for a lower back pain of 6 months duration. Physical exam was unremarkable except for the lower back pain. There were no signs of radiculopathy, lower extremity weakness, or bowel/bladder dysfunction. Neurologic exam was normal at presentation.\nMRI of the lumbar spine was performed on a 3T Ingenia unit (Philips, Netherlands) in the following planes and sequences: 1) sagittal T1 turbo spin-echo (TSE), T2 TSE, short tau inversion recovery fat suppression (STIR), 2) axial T1 TSE, T1 fat-saturated, T2 TSE, 3) coronal T2 TSE. There was evidence of SCM (type I) at L1-L2 level (Figures ,2), with a genuine chondro-osseous ligament central in anteroposterior orientation, dividing the canal and cord at this level, with the bifid cord joined together adequately proximally and distally, remaining of normal signal and showing no evidence of hydrosyringomyelia. There’s no intra- or extramedullary masses or lipoma. The spinal canal is congenitally wide from L1 and downwards without any associated myelomeningocele. Additionally, the vertebral bodies were of normal outlines and signal, without accompanying vertebral collapse or fractures. Intact posterior elements and vertebro-pedicular junctions were also noted.\nThis patient had an isolated SCM without any other associated spinal cord dysraphisms or vertebral column malformation."
"A 25-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus presented to the hospital with a two-month history of shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and palpitations, which was treated with albuterol and prednisone without significant improvement. He subsequently developed odynophagia, night sweats, and occasional diarrhea, and he lost 20 lb of weight. He underwent a chest computed tomography (CT), which revealed a large mediastinal mass measuring 8.2 cm within the subcarinal region with internal calcification, compression, and narrowing of the right main pulmonary artery and left mainstem bronchus (Figure ).\nEndobronchial ultrasound with biopsy and cervical mediastinoscopy were performed, but cytology was inadequate for diagnostic purposes. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery biopsy with adequate tissue revealed prominent follicular components composed of hyalinized germinal centers surrounded by linear arrays of mantle zone cells (onion skin). Prominent stromal components between those follicles, which are composed of many small lymphocytes associated with increased blood vessels and fibrosis, were also noted. These features were characteristic of a hyaline vascular variant of Castleman disease. Flow cytometry was nondiagnostic with mixed T- and B-lymphocytes with a polyclonal B-lymphoid predominance (Figure ).\nUnfortunately, due to significant vascular involvement and adherence to critical structures, the mass was deemed to be unresectable. He underwent chemotherapy with rituximab and then cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) with radiation but had minimal response."
"A 25-year-old previously healthy male presented to his primary care physician complaining of a two-day history of fevers, chills, sore throat, myalgias, and lymphadenopathy. Monospot and streptococcal RADT were negative. Antibiotics and corticosteroids were not prescribed. The patient’s symptoms progressed to nausea, emesis, cough, and weakness. He was admitted to a local hospital (outside facility) one week after the initial presentation with shortness of breath, productive cough, left-sided swollen neck with tenderness as well as signs of dehydration. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were initiated at the community hospital for presumed community-acquired pneumonia.\nInitial blood cultures grew Fusobacterium spp. on day two and the patient’s antibiotics were changed to piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin. His condition continued to deteriorate, and left neck tenderness continued to worsen. A CT of the neck revealed a thrombus in the left IJV (Figure ) and a CT of the chest revealed bilateral lung nodules consistent with septic pulmonary emboli (Figure ). On day three, the patient was transferred to the ICU and was emergently intubated to manage ensuing hypoxemic respiratory failure. He was then transferred to our facility for a higher acuity of care. Physical examination showed a swollen left neck. Pulmonary examination revealed bilateral rhonchi with decreased air-on-entry at the basis.\nThe antibiotic regimen was revised to incorporate piperacillin-tazobactam in addition to clindamycin. Heparin was also added to his regimen. He was extubated on hospital day seven and discharged on hospital Day 14 on oral amoxicillin-clavulanate and warfarin for three months. No data was obtained regarding clot progression and/or resolution."
"Patient was a 25-year-old male suffering from vision loss of left eye and weakness of right limbs. His CT scans showed extensive FD of left ethmoid bone, nasal bone, sphenoid bone, bilateral orbits and frontal bones with left brain tissue compressed and dislocated (Fig. ). At the same time, the young patient was found to have FD of his 7th rib. MRA showed diffuse severe stenosis of venous sinuses of the left side. The patient was unwilling to receive any surgical treatment and was lost to follow-up."
"A 25-year-old Hispanic female diagnosed with BRRS one year prior to presentation came in for burning epigastric pain over the past six months. The pain was intermittent, non-radiating, triggered by meals, relieved by antacids, and associated with postprandial nausea. She denied any weight changes, scleral icterus, hoarseness, cough, dysphagia, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, or melena. The patient also denied frequent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cigarette smoking, or any history of H. pylori infection. The physical exam was relevant for a prominent head circumference above the 97th percentile, normal-looking facial features, mild epigastric tenderness, and multiple mobile soft tissue masses corresponding with lipomas of varying sizes. They were identified on the trunk, pelvis, and lower extremities (Figure ).\nThe patient emigrated from Mexico when she was 19 years old. She was diagnosed with BRRS at the age of 24 years based on a history of neonatal macrocephaly, developmental delay, mild learning disabilities, and multiple subcutaneous lipomas which were identified at three years of age. The family history was unremarkable except for a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in her maternal grandmother at the age of 52 years.\nNone of the family members have any medical history of genetic disorders, developmental delay, or physical deformities. Based on the suggestive clinical findings and a molecular diagnosis that confirmed a heterozygous missense mutation in the PTEN gene, the patient was diagnosed with BRRS.\nDue to the increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer associated with this condition an endoscopic evaluation was performed. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed numerous 3-7 mm sessile polyps located in the distal esophagus and gastric cardia (Figure ). An erythematous and erosive mucosa was observed in the gastric antrum. The duodenum appeared normal. The colonoscopy identified numerous 3-9 mm sessile polyps throughout the entire colon (Figure ) and mild internal hemorrhoids. Histopathologic examination confirmed synchronous polyps of varying types, including inflammatory, lymphoid, and lipomas. Biopsy of the gastric mucosa identified chronic active gastritis and a positive immunohistochemical stain for H. pylori.\nThe patient received 14 days of concomitant eradication therapy for H. pylori infection. She also got education regarding BRRS, possible manifestations, and her risk of developing colorectal cancer and other malignancies. Four weeks after completion of treatment, infection eradication was confirmed by a urea breath test. She is currently following an age-appropriate cancer surveillance protocol with a multidisciplinary treatment team."
"A 25-year-old female patient from a rural area, with no medical history consulted the emergency department suffering from right hypochondrium pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Physical examination revealed tenderness of the right hypochondrium and blood tests were normal. An abdominal ultrasound showed a gallbladder sludge without signs of complications. The patient was operated on. She had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pathological examination of the gallbladder revealed an altered gallbladder wall by chronic cholecystitis lesions associated with cholesterolosis and vesicular pinworm (Figure )."
"A healthy 25-year-old gentleman presented to the ophthalmology clinic complaining of sudden onset of left eye pain and blurring of vision. He was watching his colleague hammering metal when he felt something strike his left eye with high velocity. He was not wearing safety goggles at the time.\nUpon examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and 1/60 in the left eye. There was a full thickness cornea-scleral laceration wound with uveal tissue prolapse at 7 o’clock. The pupil was peaked inferonasally. The anterior chamber was deep with cell reaction of grade 4+ and a hyphema level measuring 2mm vertically. The lens and iris were normal. Extraocular muscle movement was full. The relative afferent pupillary defect was negative. The posterior segment could not be visualized due to the hazy media. B scan ultrasound showed a vitreous haemorrhage. Computed tomography of the orbits revealed a high-density foreign body embedded in the posterior wall of the globe measuring 0.8 cm in height and 0.4 cm in the anteroposterior diameter (Figure ). The right eye was normal.\nHe underwent toilet and suturing of the left eye cornea-scleral laceration wound with intravitreal injection of vancomycin and ceftazidime. He was also commenced on intravenous ciprofloxacin. A week later, a left pars plana vitrectomy with an endolaser and gas tamponade was performed. However, the foreign body was not identified intraoperatively.\nPost-operation, the left eye vision improved, achieving his premorbid best-corrected visual acuity of 6/6 by six months post-op. The left eye healed with a peripheral corneoscleral scar (Figure ) and inferotemporal chorioretinal scar (Figure ). The IOFB was managed conservatively in view of the excellent visual acuity. The patient has remained asymptomatic since then until his last follow-up at 30 months post-operation."
"A 25-year-old male patient, a victim of a motor vehicle collision, was brought to the emergency department of the nearest medical facility which was a private hospital due to haemodynamic instability. The patient underwent immediate laparotomy which revealed 2 l of intra-peritoneal free blood, deep liver laceration involving segments IVa & b, V, VI and VIII, longitudinal mesenteric laceration and retroperitoneal haematoma at zone-II. Liver packing for 15 min was performed with approximation of mesenteric defect and insertion of two large abdominal drains. The abdomen was closed and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nThe patient was transferred to our facility ventilated, in a stable condition, he underwent full body Contrast-Enhanced Computer Tomography (CECT) () upon arrival which revealed right fronto-parietal hematoma, bilateral pneumothorax with left-sided haemothorax, grade-IV liver injury with evidence of active bleeding, grade-I spleen laceration, grade-III left kidney, T12, L1–3 left transverse processes fractures and retroperitoneal haematoma (). CECT also revealed right internal carotid intimal tear with intra and extra-cranial thrombosis and a 3 cm aneurysm. With decrease level of consciousness, the patient showed a GCS of 13 and left-sided hemiplegia.\nAs the patient was haemodynamically stable, selective interventional embolization of the active liver bleeding () followed by right carotid double-coated stent insertion and thrombolysis was performed by the interventional radiology unit (). The patient required dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) (aspirin and clopidogrel) to prevent stent-related thrombosis and improve the outcome of the concomitant ischaemic hemiplegia. This represented a management challenge in the presence of multiple sold organ injuries and retroperitoneal and intracranial haematomas that required close monitoring and high preparedness to intervene.\nThe patient stayed in ICU for three weeks before being discharged to the regular ward with very critical times of increase in haematoma size. With appropriate physiotherapy, the patient started after one month to move the lower limbs (grade-II power) and evidence of complete healing of intra-abdominal injuries."
"A 25-year-old woman with no medical illnesses presented to the hospital complaining of right upper quadrant pain and vomiting. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. An elective abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of cholelithiasis. The common bile duct was normal in caliber and liver function tests were within normal limits. She was scheduled for elective cholecystectomy.\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, an open technique was used to insert a 12 mm laparoscopic port at the umbilicus. Two 5 mm working ports were inserted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen for surgeon dissection. Only three ports were used to perform the cholecystectomy. The choice of port placement was made to provide maximal surgeon ergonomics and no modification of our usual port placement was required to facilitate the use of the robotic arm.\nThe Freehand® robotic arm was secured to the operating table and used to fixate a 10 mm zero-degree laparoscope that was introduced into the umbilical port (Figure ). The Freehand® robotic arm was completely set up in approximately two minutes and did not consume a significant amount of operating time in this case.\nThe surgeon controlled the Freehand® robotic arm using an infrared communication device fixated on a headpiece (Figure ). This allowed the surgeon full control of the laparoscope using the robotic arm (Figure ). The working instruments were controlled by the surgeon and used to demonstrate Strasberg’s critical view prior to fixation of the cystic structures (Figure ). The operation was completed in 30 minutes. During this time, camera cleaning was required on two occasions. To facilitate this, the scope was easily disconnected from the robotic arm, cleaned in the usual fashion, and reconnected to the robotic arm. The procedure to clean the scope consumed less than one minute of operating time.\nAt the end of the operation, the robot was removed and the specimen was extracted using the umbilical port. There were no complications detected. The patient was discharged from the hospital within 24 hours and recovered uneventfully."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a three week history of lower back pain, headache, photophobia and sudden onset paraparesis. On examination, she had 3/5 power in all myotomes of the lower limb with subjective paraesthesia below the knees (L3 dermatome) bilaterally. There was no acute sphincteric, bladder, bowel or perineal sensory dysfunction. She had presented 10 years previously with similar symptoms with spontaneous resolution.\nNeurological consultation was sought, and lumbar puncture was performed which revealed a normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile. On Day 4 of admission she was re-reviewed by the neurologists where she was found to have no movement in her lower limbs (0/5 power). Her lower limb reflexes were present bilaterally with downgoing plantar responses. A whole spine MRI was performed which revealed a TV cyst (). On Day 6, she reported complete resolution of her symptoms with a normal neurological examination. A repeat whole spine MRI was performed which showed spontaneous resolution of the cyst in keeping with cyst rupture. The MRI was deemed normal with no evidence of intracranial pathology as reported by the neuroradiologist.\nWe can only hypothesize rather than prove that the cyst was the cause of this patient’s neurological deficit. The transient neurological signs correlate with the transient results on imaging, whereby the cyst ruptured and later re-expanded again, as discussed below. Neurologist advice was sought, and no other abnormalities in the neuro-axis were found. Hoover’s sign was also negative.\nShe underwent a short period of inpatient physiotherapy and was discharged home. The patient did not attend further outpatient follow-up. Seven months later she attended her local emergency department with symptoms of bilateral non-dermatomal leg paraesthesia. Lumbo-sacral MRI demonstrated modest enlargement of the TV cyst in keeping with recollection. In the absence of a progressive motor or localizing neurological deficit, surgery was not felt to be indicated and she remains under outpatient surveillance."
"A 25-year-old unmarried female came to our hospital with a complaint of gradual enlarging mass in right adnexa about 1 year without pain. The patient had medical history of receiving VPS 16 years ago due to hydrocephalus (). Laboratory results were as follows: cytosine arabinoside (CA) 19–9: 49.34 U/ml (0–35) and CA 724: 19.6 U/ml (0–6.9). Hematopoiesis and clotting activity, as well as functions of the liver and kidneys were all normal. The results of ultrasound of gynecology and pelvic CT scan are shown (). Abdominal ultrasound indicated multiple angiomas were observed in the liver and spleen.\nDuring the surgery, the patient was placed from Trendelenburg position to supine position because the patient’s forehead hemangioma was swelling sharply in Trendelenburg (). The current procedure was performed using standard 4 port technique. The pneumoperitoneum was maintained at 10 mmHg. Throughout the operation, the end of the catheter was exposed, clear cerebrospinal fluid was dripped from the catheter continuously (). After excising the right adnexa, rapid pathology revealed right ovary borderline mucinous cystadenoma. The patient was discharged on the third day after surgery. In the recent follow-up, 5-year after surgery, the patient was still in good condition with no complications or relapse."
"A 25-year-old man with atopic dermatitis. In 2016, the patient was admitted to our hospital with a productive cough that had appeared 2 months prior. He had been diagnosed with BA by a previous doctor and had received OCS for 1 week, but symptoms had continued and laboratory data showed marked eosinophilia. HRCT showed mild central bronchiectasis, tree-in-bud sign, GGO, and p-consolidation (Fig. c). A. niger was detected in cultures of sputum and bronchial wash from left B5, and eosinophils were elevated to 61% in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid from left B5. Based on these data and positive specific IgE to A. fumigatus, ABPA was diagnosed and treatment with OCS (0.5 mg/kg/day) and itraconazole (200 mg/day) was initiated. His symptoms and the abnormal shadows on chest XP improved steadily."
"A 25-year-old pregnant woman was referred at 25 weeks’ gestation for fetal diagnosis of right lung agenesis and right eye hypoplasia, without clear evidence of cardiac malformations.\nA female neonate born at 37 weeks via cesarean delivery (birth weight 2101 g) showed craniofacial abnormalities postnatally, which suggested diagnosis of Goldenhar syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed abnormal drainage of the left pulmonary veins into the innominate vein, a large atrial septal defect, a small ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. Computed tomography confirmed right lung agenesis (Fig. A–D). Transthoracic echocardiography performed 2 days after birth revealed accelerated pulmonary venous flow between the vertical and the innominate vein. Progressive pulmonary venous obstruction necessitated surgical repair 3 days after birth.\nA median sternotomy was performed to expose the heart, which was rotated counterclockwise owing to right lung agenesis. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established with ascending aortic perfusion and direct bicaval venous drainage. The patent ductus arteriosus was ligated. We performed pulmonary artery venting via the left pulmonary artery, and cardiac arrest was achieved using antegrade cardioplegia infusion. The pulmonary venous chamber was well visualized after counterclockwise rotation of the heart, and we selected the posterior approach intraoperatively. The vertical vein was ligated at its confluence with the innominate vein and was divided and incised toward the pulmonary venous chamber. The corresponding posterior wall of the left atrium was incised longitudinally toward the left atrial appendage. The pulmonary venous chamber containing the vertical vein was anastomosed to the left atrium using 7–0 PDS running sutures (Fig. A–C). The atrial septal defect was directly closed. The aortic clamp time was 48 min. The left and right ventricular function was good with catecholamine support and nitric oxide administration. The heart was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass at a systemic pressure of 58/35 mmHg, pulmonary pressure of 34/13 mmHg, and central venous pressure of 6 mmHg, followed by sternal closure. Echocardiography and computed tomography confirmed absence of pulmonary venous obstruction, 1 year postoperatively (Fig. A, B)."
"A 25-year-old female with uncontrolled diabetes presented to our inpatient service with a eight-month history of gradual bilateral vision loss and intermittent left-sided retroocular headache. Ophthalmic examination showed bilateral proptosis, retrobulbar pain, conjunctival redness, lacrimation, and decreased visual acuity (VA). Due to classic ocular features of Graves’ disease, thyroid function tests T3, T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) including serological tests like anti-TSHR, thyroid peroxidase antibody, thyroid-stimulating antibody, and thyroglobulin antibodies were also performed. Results of all the tests came back normal. Values are referenced in Table .\nDue to these concerning findings on the eye examination, an ophthalmology consult was requested. Eye examination showed the ophthalmometer-measured diameter of the eye to be 30 mm compared to normal of 14-18 mm. Fundoscopic examination revealed optic atrophy. Orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to rule out other causes of proptosis like a mass and to determine the extent of ocular disease. Results of orbital MRI showed bilateral enlargement of the medial recti muscles compressing both the optic nerves (Figure ).\nThe right inferior rectus muscle was enlarged with notable bilateral orbital fat stranding and extensive edema (Figures , ).\nBrain MRI did not show any mass, space-occupying lesions of the brain, hydrocephalus, or infarction. With these peculiar findings of the extraocular muscles and orbit, diagnosis of EGO was made with consensus by endocrinology and ophthalmology. The patient was started on pulse dose intravenous steroids for three days. Her proptosis, eye swelling, and VA improved by the second day of steroid administration. Upon discharge, the patient was transitioned to oral steroids. Since the patient had uncontrolled diabetes and with this new diagnosis of EGO, she was advised to closely follow with the institutional outpatient endocrinology clinic. Considering her uncontrolled diabetes status, she was transitioned from steroids and offered the treatment targeted for thyroid orbitopathy, i.e., immunotherapy with teprotumumab. The patient received seven infusions of teprotumumab and showed a promising response. Significant improvement in VA, proptosis, and chemosis was noticed upon follow-up and the overall clinical activity score was improved."
"A 25-year-old male with no prior co-morbidities presented to the ED in August 2020 with fever, vomiting, and loose stools for four days. Fever was high grade, intermittent, associated with chills, and relieved by taking oral antipyretics. The headache had a sudden onset, was severe, throbbing in nature, involving the bilateral frontal region, and associated with photophobia and phonophobia. There was no blurring of vision, weakness, numbness, altered mentation, seizures, or loss of consciousness.\nOn arrival to the ED, he was awake, alert, and well-oriented to time, place, and person. He was afebrile with a BP of 108/66 mmHg and heart rate of 66 beats per minute. Pupils were bilaterally equal, round, and reactive to light. Neck stiffness was present. Cranial nerves examination was unremarkable. Motor and sensory systems were normal. There was generalized abdominal tenderness. Other systemic examinations were within normal limits. A clinical diagnosis of meningitis was made, which was confirmed by an elevated total leukocyte count with 84% lymphocytes on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. EV PCR was detected on biofire filmarray meningitis/encephalitis panel (BFM) in the CSF. MRI brain with contrast was unremarkable. Results of other laboratory investigations are as shown in Table .\nEmpirical IV antibiotics that were started initially were discontinued. Symptomatic treatment was given along with IV hydration. The patient remained afebrile and stable throughout admission. The headache improved with oral analgesics and he was discharged home on the third day. On a follow-up visit to the clinic two weeks later, his symptoms had completely resolved and he was able to resume daily routine activities."
"A 25-year-old female presented to the ED in 2018 with chief complaint of fever for one day and three weeks of cough, chest tightness, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and an unintentional 10-pound weight loss. She had a PMH significant for mild asthma treated with a rescue inhaler and a remote history of chlamydia. She denied any alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drug use. Her triage vital signs were temperature 36.7oC, heart rate 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 137/87 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. Her PE was significant for a grade IV/VI systolic ejection murmur heard upon cardiac auscultation at the base of the heart. Significant laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 14.3 K/mm3; C-reactive protein 118.4 mg/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate 83 mm/hr, procalcitonin 0.74 ng/mL, D-dimer 2.72 micrograms (μg)/mL (reference range <0.42 μg/mL), and a negative urine pregnancy. A CT angiogram of the chest was obtained and negative for pulmonary embolism but did show patchy infiltrates in the left lower lobe.\nBlood cultures were drawn in the ED, and the patient was initially started on IV vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam and admitted to the hospital. A TTE was obtained upon admission and showed severe mitral regurgitation, concern for a ruptured chordae tendinea, and thickening/vegetations on the leaflets concerning for endocarditis. On hospital day two, both sets of blood cultures grew aerobic Gram-negative diplococci, which were identified as N. gonorrhoeae using a VITEK analyzer (bioMérieux, Inc. USA, Durham, NC). The isolate was sensitive to ceftriaxone. A pelvic exam found no discharge or cervical motion tenderness, and cervical gonococcal and chlamydia deoxyribonucleic acid probes were negative. A transvaginal ultrasound showed no abscess or signs of pelvic inflammatory disease. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement on hospital day five, and successfully completed six weeks of IV ceftriaxone."
"A 25-year-old male with no personal or familial history of cardiovascular disease presented a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Prehospital emergency service was immediately activated, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was promptly started. When the prehospital critical care team arrived, the cardiac rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF) and a biphasic shock of 200 J was applied with conversion to a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 215 bpm (). Advanced life support was proceeded. A total of four defibrillations was applied until return of spontaneous circulation. During the transport to the hospital, the patient became unstable again presenting irregular wide complex tachycardia suggestive of preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) and a synchronized shock was applied (). On arrival at the hospital, the patient was haemodynamically stable, with no significant changes on cardiopulmonary examination."
"A 25-year-old man (weight: 126 kg, height: 185 cm, BMI: 36.8 kg/m2) felt a popping sensation and severe pain in the left knee when he twisted his left leg with the knee flexed during Judo activity. He had no history of chronic disease or steroid use. He could not actively extend his left knee. Physical examination of the left knee showed swelling, a high patella, and a palpable gap below the patella. Plain radiographs of the left knee showed patella alta (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a complete rupture of the proximal patellar tendon (). Surgery was performed in the supine position under spinal anesthesia. A straight anterior incision was made from the inferior pole of the patella to the tibial tuberosity. The patellar tendon and extensor retinaculum were completely torn at the proximal portion (). Two 5.5 mm corkscrew suture anchors with two no. 2 FiberWires (Arthrex, Naples, FL) were placed just lateral to the center of the inferior pole of the patella. All suture limbs were sutured into the patellar tendon using the Krackow technique and were fixed to the tibial tubercle using one 2.9 mm Pushlock anchor (Arthrex). Finally, an internal brace technique was used to augment and protect the repaired tendon. Two 4.75 mm SwiveLock suture anchors loaded with a 2 mm suture tape (Arthrex) were placed just lateral and medial to the patellar tendon at the inferior portion of the patella. The free ends of the suture tape were passed through a second SwiveLock suture anchor, and the suture anchor was fully inserted just lateral and medial to the tibial tubercle with the knee at 60° of flexion (). Correct placement of the patella was confirmed under fluoroscopic control, as was the stability of the repaired tendon through the range of motion.\nFor postoperative rehabilitation, the patient was placed in a locked hinged knee brace in full extension and was also instructed to perform isometric muscle training immediately after surgery. Range of motion exercise was immediately started between 0° and 90° for 2 weeks and then from 0° to 120° for 6 weeks. Partial weight-bearing was started 3 weeks after surgery, and full weight-bearing was allowed after 6 weeks. At 1 month postoperatively, full active extension could be achieved without an extension lag (). At 2 months postoperatively, the patient regained full function of the knee and returned to work. Jogging was encouraged after 3 months, and return to full sports activities was allowed at 5 months postoperatively. At the final follow-up, 12 months postoperatively, he was symptom-free with a full range of motion, and he regained preinjury functional levels (). No complications were reported during the postoperative period."
"A 25-year-old male who is medically free presented to the ED after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) with a speed of 50 m/h, frontal impaction and there was no roll over, or ejection from the car with minimal epistaxis and a small superficial wound over the nose. A nasal X-ray was done to rule out facial bone fractures, which shows no abnormality. Analgesia was given and he was referred to the otolaryngology department for follow-up. However, at that time CT scan was not done. He presented three weeks later to the primary healthcare in which the first impression was migraine and was given analgesia. However, as the headache persisted, he went to the ED and he was given analgesia and discharged. The patient returned to the ED two days later, because the headache was not gone. He described it as a throbbing headache, on and off, which increased with laying down, stress, and at night and relieved by analgesia. He scored the pain severity as nine out of 10 and described it as a pain he cannot tolerate. There was no loss of consciousness, seizures, blurred or double vision, weight loss, fever, weakness, or any neurological deficits. He was vitally stable, and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 15, oriented to time, place and person, intact memory, pupils reactive to light equally, all limbs power were five out of five, no pronator drift, intact sensation, and normal gait. At this time, the CT scan was done and showed bilateral frontoparietal SASDH with midline shift with mass effect upon the adjacent brain parenchyma (Figure ). A cerebral angiogram with embolization was done for him. The patient improved after the intervention and was discharged. He followed up with neurosurgery and another CT which showed that the hematoma regressed in size. After this regression, conversion to chronic SDH was observed in CT (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old African American female with a past medical history of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, anxiety, and depression on escitalopram (Lexapro) presented to our emergency room for two days of abdominal pain and intractable vomiting with nausea relieved by hot showers. She reported having a similar episode five months prior, which had required hospitalization for 21 days for the management of electrolyte imbalance. At that time, she reported having multiple arrhythmias and cardiac MRI but stated that her workup had been negative. Her arrhythmias had been attributed to hypokalemia. Since that hospitalization, the patient reported losing 30lb and had not followed up as an outpatient for her arrhythmia. Physical exam revealed normal heart sounds, no murmurs, no evidence of jugular venous distension, and clear lung sounds bilaterally. In the emergency room, labs were notable for hypokalemia (3.4 mEq/L), hypophosphatemia (2.1 mg/dL), and normal serum magnesium (1.9 mg/dL). Also, emergency room electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed sinus bradycardia, wide-notched T waves, and prolonged QT ranging from 550 to 800 msec; QTc was 595 msec (Figure ).\nThe urine drug screen was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 50-55%, normal right ventricular systolic function, and no significant valvular disease. In the ED, the patient was started on ondansetron for nausea and vomiting. On the medical floor, her serum potassium fell to 2.7 mEq/L, and she developed premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and subsequently an episode of torsades de pointes on telemetry after receiving ondansetron, a QT-prolonging medication (Figure ).\nThe arrhythmia resolved spontaneously; however, she was transferred to ICU for further monitoring. Once her electrolyte imbalance resolved and QT-prolonging medications, ondansetron, and escitalopram were discontinued, her EKG returned to the baseline of normal sinus rhythm (Figure ).\nSubsequent genetic testing using Invitae Diagnostic (Invitae, San Francisco, CA) ultimately revealed two uncertain variants of the KCNH2 and RYR2 genes with c.2692+7c>T and c.3932C>T variants, respectively.\nThe patient was started on propranolol per Electrophysiology and a loop recorder was placed prior to discharge."
"A 25-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and recent SARS-CoV-2 infection presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of hemoptysis and shortness of breath for two-day duration. She was tested positive for COVID-19 about three weeks earlier after experiencing sore throat. As she was not hypoxic, she was not admitted to the hospital. She reported worsening shortness of breath, constant right-sided chest pain which was worse on inspiration, and occasional palpitations at rest. She denied any leg pain, leg swelling, fever, or dizziness. She reports vaping for the past few years but denies the use of illicit drugs. On admission, vitals were stable, afebrile, and saturating well on room air and on ambulation. Her body mass index was 19.6 kg/m2. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with normal axis and no significant ST-T wave changes. Chest X-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary changes (Figure ).\nDoppler study for bilateral lower extremities showed no evidence of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Initial laboratory showed normal white blood cell and platelets, low hemoglobin, and high D-dimer. Inflammatory markers otherwise were unremarkable. Detailed laboratory parameters are shown in Table .\nHer nasopharyngeal swab was negative for both SARS-CoV-2 antigen and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed sub-segmental left lower lobe pulmonary embolism with no evidence of right heart strain as shown in Figure .\nShe was started on heparin drip as per pulmonary embolism protocol. Echocardiography study was normal with no right heart strain. She was clinically stable and was discharged on apixaban 10 mg two times a day for 10 days and then 5 mg two times a day with outpatient follow-up with a hematologist."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with a four-month history of abdominal pain, renal stones and recent recurrent pathological fractures rendering him wheelchair bound. Past medical history was unremarkable, and no previous intervention was performed. The patient denied any allergies and family history was unremarkable. Physical examination was free. Investigations revealed hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism with hypophosphatemia. The neck ultrasound was unremarkable. Non-contrast CT of neck and chest detected an anterior mediastinal mass (). The 19mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scintigraphy (99mTc-MIBI) showed increased uptake of the tracer in the mediastinum (). The patient consented to have his information disclosed in this case report.\nThe patient was positioned in the semi-supine position with the arms abducted and the left side elevated. Endocrinological review was performed prior to surgery to optimize electrolyte levels. The procedure was performed by a consultant thoracic surgeon in our institute which is a tertiary care hospital. Three-port thoracoscopy was performed on the left side using a thirty-degree 10 mm thoracoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlinger, Germany). Working ports were placed in the 3rd and 6th intercostal spaces at the anterior axillary line and the camera port in the 4th intercostal space at the mid-axillary line (). Careful inspection of the left phrenic nerve and the thymic area harboring the mass was performed. Dissection was done using monopolar energy and the mass excised en-block (). A chest drain was inserted. The procedure was uneventful with no postoperative complications."
"In 2015, a 25-year-old Hispanic female presented 10 days after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery with laboratory results consistent with a TMA (). Treatment with prednisone and plasma exchange (PE) was unsuccessful and HD was initiated. ADAMTS13 activity and APL Abs were normal. Eculizumab was started after kidney biopsy confirmed a TMA (not shown). Hemodialysis was discontinued after 8 weeks. Two months later, she developed flash pulmonary edema due to acute mitral valve regurgitation secondary to an anterior leaflet perforation, which necessitated a mitral valve replacement. The patient is currently doing well with stable kidney function. In retrospect, the proband's two sisters had similar clinical presentations."
"The patient is a 25-year-old female with debilitating lower back pain with intermittent radiations down to her right leg. A pre-treatment MRI from July 2008 showed a significant reduction in disc height (8.5 mm), disc signal at L5–S1with a posterior disc protrusion of 4.3 mm (Fig. b left). Patient was explained the experimental nature of the procedure and signed an informed consent. This patient received a total of 51.6 million autologous, hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs divided in two injections per patient request. She was transplanted with 14.3 million MSCs on July 2008 and with 37.3 million MSCs on June 2009. Cells were delivered into the right posterior annulus fibrosus and at the annular/nuclear interface of the L5–S1intervertebral disc. No complications occurred during the procedure and no adverse events were reported directly following the procedure. In April 2014 the patient returned for a follow-up examination consisting of a physical examination, completion of a quality of life questionnaire, and a lower back MRI. The lower back MRI post MSC transplantation showed no neoplasms or abnormalities surrounding the treated region. MRI measurements showed maintenance of disc height (8.8 mm) and a 20 % reduction of the posterior protrusion from 4.3 to 3.4 mm as compared to the pre- stem cell treatment MRI (Fig. b right). Based on the quality of life questionnaire, the patient self-reported an overall improvement of 90 % post stem cell transplant and an increase in strength and range of motion (Table ). No adverse events were reported due to the stem cell procedure based on the quality of life questionnaire and the physical examination."
"A 25-year-old G1P1 female presented to the Emergency Department in March, 2015, with her 5-month-old daughter, fiancée, and concerned family members 1 week after breastfeeding cessation.\nDespite 3 years of sustained sobriety from opioid use, she reported a de novo obsession about relapsing to heroin when her fiancée received an opiate prescription. After attending multiple AA meetings and three consecutive nights without sleep, she believed the big book of alcoholics anonymous was talking to her for a special purpose. She reported sleep-deprived energy enhancement, unfulfilled goal-oriented productivity, hyper-talkativeness, hyper-sexuality and increased nicotine use. Concurrent depressive symptoms included hopelessness, worthlessness, poor concentration, lack of appetite, and ego-dystonic intrusive thoughts that she may kill herself or her child. She reported daily cannabis and cigarette (10/day) use since parturition and was not on any medications and did not consume alcohol. Cannabis use was chronic and she had never experienced a psychotic episode prior to breastfeeding discontinuation. Her psychiatric history included a major depressive episode at age 16 treated briefly with citalopram and an opioid use disorder in full sustained remission for 3 years. Her family history included a mother with bipolar I disorder.\nHer mental status was significant for pressured speech, affective lability, expansiveness, distractibility, and tangential, grandiose, delusional self-referential content. Her transient thoughts of self-harm and harming her child were not associated with intent. Physical examination revealed lower abdominal tenderness commensurate with her first menses since parturition. Urine drug screen was positive for cannabis.\nSymptoms remitted during a 5-day hospitalization with olanzapine and lithium. Her discharge diagnosis was bipolar disorder, type I, current episode manic with psychotic features and a mixed-feature specifier."
"A 25-year-old male presented to our outpatient department following an injury to the lid of his left eye (OS), caused by a sharp iron object, that occurred while working without taking safety measures (Figure 1 ).\nOn examination, he had an injury to the lower lid involving the lacrimal canal (Figure 2 ), a tear in the conjunctiva, and a ruptured inferior rectus muscle (Figure 3 ). He also had hypertropia of the OS and absent inferior movement in the affected eye.\nThe eyelid was repaired surgically in layers. The lacrimal canal was repaired using the Teflon sleeve of a 22G Intracath (Figure 2 ), which was left in place for 6 weeks. We located the proximal end of the canal and confirmed it by syringing. We found the proximal end of the inferior rectus muscle and sutured it to the distal end, achieving proper strength, as detected by orthophoria in the primary position and inferior movements at the end of the repair (Figure 3 ).\nThe patient complained of diplopia in the early postoperative period. This was evaluated with diplopia charts and the patient improved slowly, both subjectively and objectively. Patient presented to us again with complaint of diplopia after 3 years, on examination we detected right eye hypertropia (Figure 4 ), inferior rectus resection was done and became orthophoria.\nThe patient achieved orthophoria and full movement in inferior gaze (Figure 5 )."
"A 25 year old male presented with bilateral blurring of vision for one week and no signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.\nThe vision as tested on his initial visit was 6/6 bilaterally with a normal appearing fundus. This visual loss rapidly progressed over a week to 6/60 with near vision < N36 in either eye. He was fully reevaluated. Examination of ocular motility and anterior segment evaluation with a slit lamp were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed mildly hyperemic and elevated optic nerve heads bilaterally. The retina and vasculature were normal.\nA preliminary diagnosis of linezolid induced optic neuropathy was made and he was started on oral prednisolone (40 mg daily tapering by 10 mg weekly) and was followed up. Linezolid tablets were discontinued. He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast and it was normal.\nHe underwent a perimetry (central 30–2), fundus photography and an optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve head bilaterally. He underwent repeat OCT on day 10 and day 45 and a repeat perimetry on day 45.\nThe vision improved significantly over the next few weeks and at day 45 follow-up he was reading 6/6 with normal N6 visual acuity.\nThe OCT test results showed similar findings of generalized RNFL thickness, which rapidly subsided. The initial perimetry showed generalized reduction of sensitivity bilaterally along with centrocecal scotomas in the left eye with a central temporal scotoma. No such scotoma was seen in the right eye. There was a rapid reduction in scotoma size and intensity over the follow-up period."
A 25-year-old male presented with complaints of bilateral blurring of vision for two weeks. The patient reported no symptoms or signs suggestive of peripheral neuropathy.\nThe vision as tested on his initial visit was 6/60 with near vision < N36 in either eye. Examination of ocular motility and anterior segment evaluation with a slit lamp were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed mildly hyperemic and elevated optic nerve heads bilaterally. The retina and vasculature were normal. Linezolid tablets were discontinued. There were no symptoms or signs suggestive of peripheral neuropathy.\nHe underwent an initial perimetry (central 30–2) and fundus photography. He declined to undergo an optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve heads. The perimetry showed generalized reduction of sensitivity bilaterally along with centrocecal scotoma in the left eye associated with a central temporal scotoma. No scotoma was seen in the right eye. Linezolid (600mg on alternate days) was re-introduced after 3 weeks of discontinuation. He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast and it was normal in all respects.
"A 25-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia calls 911 from a homeless shelter because of intense command auditory hallucinations to hurt himself. He has been in town for six days from out of state. He tells you he moved “because I needed to” and that he often remains in a city for about a month. He will leave town “when the voices tell me to.”\nPatients with schizophrenia and delusional disorder often present after traveling from another state with vague intentions or paranoia; for example, they may “want a change” or to “see the mountains.” Their knowledge of local resources is often similarly unclear, and they may be uncertain where to obtain shelter, food, or medication. Some patients present after calling 911 with suicidal ideation. An assessment quickly reveals that the patient uses this strategy repeatedly in new cities to obtain treatment and orient to local resources. These patients may become high utilizers over a short period before moving on to another city.\nPatients with bipolar disorder are also prone to peregrination during manic episodes. These patients are unlikely to seek out care once in a new city. More likely, they present via police or ambulance after causing a disruption in the community. Co-occurring substance use is not uncommon.\nPatients with personality, dissociative, and factitious disorders often arrive to emergency care in dramatic fashion:"
"A 25-year-old primigravida presented at 28 weeks of gestation with symptoms of facial acne and abdominal and facial hirsutism appearing first at 23 weeks of gestation.\nUltrasound imaging showed a viable fetus with a normal growth and morphology and a 12 × 9 cm right adnexal mass with necrotic areas and low color Doppler signals (). The left adnexa was unremarkable. The blood test showed a mild elevated level of transaminases, negative tumoral markers, and elevated serum level of testosterone (6270 ng/dL; normal range 0.4–4.1 ng/dL), SHBG (689,6 nmol/L; normal range 18–114 nmol/L), androstenedione (≤200 ng/dL; normal range 0.4–4.1), and DHEAS (645,9 μg/dL; normal range 98,8–340). A magnetic resonance was proposed but patient declined the study.\nIn the following weeks blood tests and ultrasound follow-up showed progressive worsening of the clinical situation with an aggravation of hirsutism (Ferriman and Gallwey score: 18) and the onset of clitoromegaly and deepening voice.\nA caesarean section was performed at 34 weeks of gestation because of the worsening of laboratory tests and symptoms (with also the appearance of severe right hydronephrosis), the incomplete diagnosis due to the patient's denied consent, and the suspected ovarian malignancy. Antenatal corticosteroids with two doses of betamethasone (12 mg i.m.) were administrated to the patient prior to surgery.\nDuring the operation the uterus and left ovary were macroscopically normal, while an extremely enlarged right ovary mass was observed (); unilateral oophorectomy was then performed. Final pathologic examination revealed pregnancy luteoma.\nA healthy male infant of 1560 grams was delivered; Apgar score was 8 at the first minute and 10 at the fifth minute.\nA blood sample of umbilical cord showed elevated levels of testosterone and DHEAS (200 ng/dL and 201 μg/dL, resp.).\nAfter the resection, the serum androgen levels gradually fell down as shown in .\nPostoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 4 days after the caesarean section.\nBlood samples at 30, 60, and 120 days from delivery showed regular androgen levels with a progressive improvement of virilisation symptoms (Figures , , and )."
"Patient 2 was a 25-year-old healthy man who runs a small restaurant in Shenzhen. On 1 January 2016, the patient developed a high fever (39.5 °C), cough and dyspnea. On 6 January, the patient was hospitalized and diagnosed with severe pneumonia, Type 1 respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, left pleural effusion and an electrolyte disorder. He was immediately administered antiviral treatment with Tamiflu (150 mg bid). Respiratory samples were collected on the 6th of January and found to be HPAI H5N6-positive. Combined antiviral therapy with Tamiflu (150 mg bid), zanamivir (10 mg each time, bid) and peramivir (300 mg qd) was then administered on 7 January. The patient eventually recovered from his severe condition.\nEpidemiological investigations of the infection sources of both human H5N6 infections were conducted when the patients were confirmed as H5N6-positive. Patient 1 bought a duck from a neighboring LPM approximately four days prior to the onset of her illness. Patient 2 reported a history of visiting an LPM prior to the onset of his illness. Environmental samples and swabs of poultry feathers collected from the epidemiologically identified LPMs tested positive for the H5N6 virus (). This result indicated that the LPMs were the potential sources of the human infections."
"A 25-year-old female was found to have obstructive jaundice secondary to choledocholithiasis and was referred to our hospital for ERCP. This showed Mirizzi's syndrome type 1 causing an obstructive jaundice (). A biliary stent was inserted and we recommended open cholecystectomy. However, when she went back to her referring hospital, she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Few days post surgery, her obstructive jaundice was not relieved and she was sent back for ERCP and stent removal. Upon doing the 2nd ERCP, she was noticed to have three stones impacted in the cystic duct at junction with the common bile duct consistent with Mirizzi’s syndrome type 1. Two subsequent ERCP’S Attempts to extract the stones by two experienced gastroenterologists and with different manipulations were unsuccessful. She underwent open resection of the remaining part of the gallbladder and Hartmann pouch with stone extraction from cystic duct. One month postoperatively, she presented for a follow-up ERCP and stent removal. The ERCP showed dilated CBD and common hepatic duct and a remaining stone in the cystic duct (). Several attempts to extract this stone using trapezoid basket were unsuccessful due to the size and shape of the stone and its impaction into the cystic duct. A 10-French, 10 cm stent was inserted and the plan was to arrange for an ERCP plus Spyglass and laser lithotripsy. This was performed (ERCP, Spyglass and intraductal laser lithotripter) in which the following was seen: Initially attempts to extract the stone in the cystic duct using trapezoid basket were not successful. The Spyglass was inserted () and cholangioscope and cystic ductoscopy showed a large yellowish stone in the cystic duct (). There were no stones in the CBD. Using the holmium laser calculase device, the probe with frequency 6, energy 1.2 - 1.7 was used and the light directed over the stone. Pulses were initiated several times resulting in fragmentation of the stone. These stone fragments were extracted () and the cholangiogram confirmed that CBD and Cystic ducts were stones free (). After that, the patient’s jaundice gradually resolved and on follow-up six months later, she was doing well with no complaints."
"A 25-year-old male patient in permanent dentition presented to the orthodontic clinic with Class II subdivision on Class I skeletal base, with crooked teeth. At the clinical examination, the patient presented a little bulge in the 4.4–4.5 region () and at the panoramic radiography the presence of a supplemental tooth in this region was discovered (). The tooth was completely formed; the root apex was closed and seemed not to create any damage to the circumstance region.\nThe treatment objective is to start an orthodontic treatment in the upper and lower jaw.\nIn this case, the only possible choice was the extraction of the ST. The patient came to the clinic to correct his malocclusion by means of an orthodontic treatment. Hence, due to the will of the patient to start an orthodontic treatment, the extraction was the best choice.\nBefore extracting the tooth, it was decided to perform a CBCT of the lower arch to assess the relationship between the ST and the mandibular nerve. Examining the CBCT ascertained that there was no contiguity between the tooth and the nerve (Figures and ) and that the roots of 4.4 and 4.5 were damaged (Figures –). Hence, due to the favorable tooth position, the root damage, and the patient's will, the extraction was performed. After the extraction a periapical radiograph of the extraction site was done (); then the patient started the orthodontic treatment."
"A 25-year-old man, resident of Uttar Pradesh, presented to the otorhinolaryngology outpatient department with a painless swelling of the left cheek, gradually increasing in size since he first noticed it 1 year earlier. He gave a history of temporary increase in size of the swelling while eating, with subsequent return to previous size on completion of a meal. On examination, a 2 cm × 1.5 cm globular swelling was present just below the left malar prominence, which, on palpation, was nontender, euthermic, firm, and mobile in all directions with no fixity to skin or underlying tissues and a grossly normal overlying skin. The swelling increased in prominence when the patient was made to clench his teeth. He was afebrile, with no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. His complete blood counts revealed absolute eosinophilia (1100/mm3), with an essentially normal peripheral smear.\nOn ultrasonography, a cystic dilatation of the middle part of the left Stensen's duct was seen with minimal lobulated soft tissue contents and a mildly thickened duct wall. A contrast enhanced computed tomography scan was done that showed a small, well defined, hypodense cystic lesion superficial to the anterolateral aspect of the left masseter muscle indenting its surface, communicating with a tubular hypodense structure communicating with the parotid gland, suggestive of a dilated Stensen's duct with a sialocele formation (Figures and ).\nAfter clinical and radiological examination, the differential diagnosis that came to our mind was that it is either a sialolith blocking the duct that has lead to the inflammatory swelling or cysticercosis but further investigations showed a diagnosis which was very different and rare.\nFine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) revealed macrophages and nucleated squamous cells in a dense acute suppurative background with degenerated microfilariae, with no acid-fast bacilli ().\nOn the basis of the radiological and cytological findings, a final diagnosis of filariasis of the parotid duct was made, and the patient was started on a two-week course of diethyl carbamazine, along with a five-day adjunctive course of albendazole.\nOn completion of the medical management, the patients symptoms were completely resolved, and he remains asymptomatic after 10 months of regular follow-up."
A 25-year-old female patient was admitted with complaints of headaches and behavioral changes. Cranial MRI of the patient revealed a non-contrasting lesion with irregular boundaries and hypointensity in T2A sections stretching along the sphenoid wing on the left frontal lobe (Fig. ). Cranial CT of the patient revealed a mostly ossified formation with irregular boundaries that was hyperintense compared with the brain parenchyma located along the left sphenoid wing (Fig. ). Pathology was not observed in MRI angiography of the patient. Left pterional craniotomy and Sylvian dissection were used to access the lesion. A hard cube-like black formation was observed (Fig. ). The mass was dissected from its surroundings and was easily removed. Hard calcified lesions adjacent to the mass were completely excised (Fig. ). Normal parenchymal tissue was reached. The patient’s pathology was reported as a hamartoma.
"Informed consent was obtained from the patient. This case report was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University.\nA 25-year-old gravida 1 para 0 woman who conceived naturally underwent routine obstetric ultrasonography at 30 weeks’ gestation that revealed an intracranial solid-cystic tumor. The mother suffered from anemia during pregnancy. The father was healthy.\nUltrasound (Fig. ) showed that the tumor was 2.5 × 2.3 × 2.1 cm3 in size, located in the sellar region. It was regular shape and slightly heterogeneous solid mass with a little cystic component. No color flow was present inside the tumor but the peripheral encirclement by arterial circle of Willis. The lateral ventricles and the head circumference were normal. Fetal heart Tei-index was 0.32 (normal). The evaluation of fetal Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) was normal. The amniotic fluid was normal, and no other associated malformations were detected.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was taken subsequently confirmed the result of ultrasound. Meanwhile, it also provided more detailed information on the fetal central nervous system (CNS) including fetal brain dysplasia and the possible compression of optic nerves caused by the tumor (Fig. ). The parents were informed that the most likely diagnosis was optical nerve glioma; however, the malignant intracranial tumor was difficult to be excluded prenatally.\nThe pregnant woman underwent cord blood samplings because of the congenital malformations. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) (Fig. ) was performed for prenatal genetic analysis used with fetal cord blood and parental blood samples after the normal chromosomal karyotype analysis was revealed. It detected a 0.72-Mb duplication at 4q35.2 in fetus which was associated with epilepsy () and cardiac anomalies (). It encompassed the FRG1 and FRG2 genes. In addition, the CMA also revealed a 0.13-Mb deletion at 6q26 which was located inside the PARK2 gene. The mutation in the PARK2 gene (OMIM ID: ∗602544) is known to be related to autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson disease.[ Neither the duplication nor deletion was inherited from the parents.\nUltimately, the parents chose termination of pregnancy (TOP). The abnormal imaging findings were confirmed by autopsy (Fig. ). The histological examination showed low-grade neuroepithelial tumor. A mixed neuronal-glial tumor was final diagnosis because 2 cell types (neuronal cells and glial cells) existed in the tumor. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry results."
"Case 1 involved a 25-year-old man who had undergone surgical resection of anaplastic ependymoma extending from the brainstem to the fourth ventricle (Fig. ). Two days after neurosurgery, laboratory data showed an unexpectedly severe inflammatory response (white cell count, 18,900/μL; C-reactive protein (CRP), 12.8 mg/dl). The patient was observed with administration of meropenem.\nTwo days later, he developed shock and the abdomen appeared severely distended. Vital signs were: temperature, 39.1 °C; heart rate, 130 beats/min; blood pressure, 73/37 mmHg under medication with dopamine 8 μg/kg/min and noradrenaline 0.25 μg/kg/min; and oxygen saturation, 94 % in room air. Laboratory data showed: white cell count, 23,100/μL; platelet count, 32,000/μL; CRP, 5.48 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) showed free air and massive ascites (Fig. ), and emergency surgery was performed under a presumptive diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation. On laparotomy, 3 L of muddy ascites was removed, and a perforation 3.5 cm in diameter was found in the second portion of the duodenal bulb (Fig. ). Antrectomy including the ulcerated portion using Billroth II reconstruction with Braun anastomosis, insertion of a duodenal drainage tube from the duodenal stump, and cholecystectomy with insertion of a bile drainage tube from the cystic duct were performed.\nTen days after the ulcer operation, major leakage of the gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy required re-operation, involving gastric disconnection, gastrostomy, duodenostomy, and feeding jejunostomy. After reoperation, the patient developed multiple-organ failure, but he recovered with intensive care. Eight months after the reoperation, digestive tract reconstruction surgery was performed using the Roux-en-Y method. Since that reconstruction surgery, the patient has been making satisfactory progress."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian woman with documented hypercalcemia since the age of 16 presented with concerns regarding the impact of hypercalcemia on pregnancy outcomes. The patient's biochemistry prior to pregnancy showed albumin adjusted calcium of 2.61 mmol/L (reference range: 2.10–2.55 mmol/L), albumin of 44 g/L (reference range: 33–48 g/L), PTH of 33 ng/L (reference range: 10–55 ng/L), and serum phosphate of 0.99 mmol/L (reference range: 0.80–1.50 mmol/L). A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is unknown for the patient during pregnancy, but previous 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 58.1 nmol/L (reference range: 40–110 nmol/L). Her calcium to creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR) was 0.79% prior to pregnancy, which is consistent with FHH. The proband's mother was hypercalcemic (albumin adjusted calcium = 2.74 mmol/L, albumin 36 g/L).\nDuring the second trimester of pregnancy the patient's albumin adjusted calcium was 2.59 mmol/L, albumin was 33 g/L, and her CCCR increased to 1.99%, a value more consistent with PHPT than FHH. She had an uncomplicated delivery at 40 weeks of gestational age. A healthy male was born with asymptomatic hypercalcemia (serum calcium = 2.79 mmol/L, reference range: 1.90–2.60 mmol/L), which persisted at two years of age. While breastfeeding, the patient's albumin adjusted calcium was 2.53 mmol/L. Subsequently, the patient had two first-trimester spontaneous abortions. She then carried a fourth pregnancy to term and gave birth to a healthy female who also had asymptomatic hypercalcemia (serum calcium = 2.75 mmol/L, reference range: 1.90–2.60 mmol/L) at birth. Ultimately, genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous mutation of the R716 CE gene on the calcium sensing receptor and the patient was diagnosed with Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia."
"A 25-year-old right-handed male office worker became inebriated with a friend at a social function and they fell together, with his friend landing on top of his left shoulder. The patient experienced severe left shoulder pain soon after the fall, visited a local orthopedic clinic on the day of the injury, and was referred to our hospital the next day.\nExamination showed swelling around the left distal clavicle and shoulder pain that increased with elevation of the shoulder. Past medical and family histories were noncontributory. Radiography demonstrated a left distal clavicular fracture (type 2b according to Craig's classification and type 3B1 according to Robinson's classification) with an avulsion fracture of the coracoid attachment of the CCL [] ().\nSurgery was performed on the third day after the injury via a horizontal incision just above the distal clavicle. The conoid ligament had been avulsed from the coracoid with a bone fragment of approximately 15 mm × 10 mm. A small part of the trapezoid ligament had also been avulsed with another small bone fragment; however, most of the trapezoid ligament was anatomically intact. A Scorpion® plate (Aimedic MMT, Tokyo, Japan) was used to secure the fractured distal clavicle. The conoid ligament with avulsed bone fragment was fixed to the fracture bed of the coracoid with a Ti Screw Suture Anchor with EasySlide™ Surface Treatment (Biomet, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) ().\nAfter 3 days of immobilization in a sling, passive range of motion exercise of the shoulder was started. Active range of motion exercise was initiated at postoperative week 6. The Scorpion plate was removed at 8 months postoperatively. The fractured bones had achieved a firm union 1 year postoperatively (Figures and ). The Constant score ratio to the normal side was 100% at 2 years postoperatively []."
"A male infant who was the second gestation of a 25-year-old healthy mother was born by vaginal delivery subsequent to 39 weeks of gestation. There was no consanguinity between the parents. Initially, the baby was fed with only breast milk. On the 20th day of his life he was admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory distress. In the physical examination tachypnea, intercostal retractions and crackles were observed. As diffuse interstitial pneumonic infiltration had been shown on the chest radiography, empiric antibiotic treatment (ampicillin, gentamicin) was initiated. Neither bacterial growth on the blood culture nor history of maternal infection during the pregnancy period was detected. Serological tests were negative for CMV, rubella, toxoplasma, herpes simplex type 2, and human immunodeficiency virus. Ventriculomegaly and periventricular calcifications were determined on transfontanellar ultrasound and computerized tomography.\nOphthalmic examination was performed with indirect biomicroscopy and +30 D funduscopic lens. Intraocular pressures of both eyes were 16 mmHg with tono-pen contact tonometer. Retinal examination revealed that bilateral moderate vitritis, dense pigmented, white-black colored diffuse scars involving all quadrants of the periphery retina corresponding to the necrotizing retinitis, as well as perivasculitis, vascular sheathing, retinal hemorrhages, and even resembling frosted branch angiitis were seen around posterior pole (Figures , , , and ).\nBecause of having suspicious retinal and clinical findings of any viral infection, particularly congenital CMV infection, further evaluation was performed. Although CMV specific IgM was undetectable, high blood CMV viral load (CMV DNA, 7200000 copy/mL) was found in his blood sample with the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Systemic intravenous ganciclovir (10 mg/kg/day) treatment was initiated for 15 days. After the treatment, retinal findings including vascular sheathing and leakage and perivasculitis were resolved along with persisting necrotized peripheral retina (Figures and ). The general health condition of patient was unresponsive to the ongoing antibiotic and antiviral administrations. In blood analyses performed for investigating immune dysfunction, decreased count of total lymphocytes, lymphocyte subgroups, and immunoglobulins levels that indicate the diagnosis of severe combined immune dysfunction were gained. In spite of all medical interventions, the patient died during the 4th month of life due to severe respiratory insufficiency."
"A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 woman at 7 weeks of pregnancy was admitted to our unit with vaginal bleeding. Siblings from both previous pregnancies had been delivered by cesarean section. Besides these two surgeries, her medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination showed no abdominal tenderness or rebound. Speculum examination revealed a normal cervix with minimal bleeding and without any cervical dilatation. Her blood pressure (110/70 mmHg) and pulse rate (80 beats/min) were within normal limits; hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dL and hCG was 38067 mIU/mL. A TVUS (Toshiba Aplio, Tokyo, Japan) performed at admission showed that there was no intrauterine gestational sac or fetal pole and that the intrauterine cavity was filled with hemorrhagic fluid. However, a gestational sac of dimensions 36 × 42 mm diameter and a viable fetus with crown to lump length of 5.3 mm were visualized near the isthmus and at the exact location of the scar from the previous cesarean section (). A color Doppler US demonstrated proliferative growth of the peritrophoblastic vessels around the gestational sac, and a spectral Doppler US showed the fetal heart activity (). There was no free fluid in Douglas pouch and no adnexial pathology was observed. Based on these findings a definitive diagnosis of CSEP was made. The patient was informed of all possible treatment options and complications and adequately counseled. Because of the high hCG level, relatively advanced gestational age, and proximity of the gestational sac and the scar site from the previous cesarean section, medical management was rejected in favor of laparoscopic resection. During laparoscopy, the Fallopian tubes and both ovaries appeared normal, and no free peritoneal fluid or hematoma was observed. At first glance, no gestational sac protruding from the outer uterine surface was visible. Therefore, the vesicouterine peritoneum was incised to evaluate the scar site of the previous cesarean section(s). As the gestational sac was very close to the endometrial cavity, there was no visible swelling that corresponded to the gestational sac, and real time TVUS under direct laparoscopic supervision was used to confirm the location of the gestational sac. Subsequently, using an 8 mm Karman aspiration cannula, the gestational sac was evacuated by vacuum aspiration without any complications. A postprocedure TVUS showed a significant decrease in the size of the gestational sac and the patient was discharged without any complaints on postoperative day 2. The patient's hCG levels dropped to 901 mIU/mL after one week and were below 5 mIU/mL after two weeks of surgery."
"A healthy 25-year-old woman visited our dental clinic 24 hours after an accidental fall. The physical examination revealed contusion of the lower lip, uncomplicated coronal fracture of all four upper incisors (Fig. ), and extrusive luxation of the upper right central incisor, which was also confirmed by the X-ray study (Fig. ). Alveolar fracture of the upper anterior buccal plate was identified by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) (Fig. ) (,,).\nOn the first visit and under local anesthesia, we repositioned the upper right central incisor within its socket, followed by splinting to the neighboring teeth with wire and composite material (,). Provisional reconstruction of the coronal fractures with composite was also carried out on the same visit. Antibiotic treatment was prescribed in the form of amoxicillin 875 mg and clavulanic acid 125 mg (Augmentine®, GSK,80 G, Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom), together with analgesia in the form of ibuprofen 600 mg (Normon, Madrid, Spain), during one week (,,).\nThree weeks later vitality testing using a tetrafluoroethane spray (Pharmaethyl®, Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France) yielded negative results with both upper central incisors and the right lateral incisor. Endodontic treatment of these teeth was sub-sequently carried out, with internal bleaching of the upper right lateral incisor using 35% hydrogen peroxide (Opalescence Endo; Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA), due to discoloration secondary to pulp necrosis. Internal bleaching lasted four weeks, after which composite veneers were prepared (Filtek Supreme XTE; 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) for all four upper incisors in order to improve the esthetic outcome (Fig. ).\nFollowing stabilization of the clinical and esthetic condition of the patient, and after a 5-month waiting period, CBCT evaluation of the alveolar bone fractures confirmed healing of the buccal plate.\nAs final restoration, esthetic tests were made for the fitting of lithium disilicate veneers (IPS e.max Press; Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) on the four upper incisors. Preparation for veneers with a buccal thickness of 0.5 mm and a curved chamfer of 0.3-0.5 mm was carried out (Fig. ), followed by imprinting with triple-zero retraction thread (Ultrapak; Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) and polyether (Impregum; 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) as imprint material. The veneers were cemented using an adhesive technique (Variolink Veneer; Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), and resulted in a more natural smile (Figs. ,).\nAfter two years the patient remains asymptomatic, with no signs of root resorption or ankylosis of the damaged teeth."
"We report the case of a 25-year-old man who had been diagnosed with AOSD five years before admission. His condition had been successfully controlled with 100 mg/d of anakinra and 5 mg/d of prednisolone. Previous attempts to reduce his immunosuppressive therapy had failed due to frequent relapses with severe arthritis and episodes of high-spiking fevers. His family history was negative for autoimmune diseases or inherited diseases.\nOn admission to another hospital, he presented with high fever, sore throat, and arthralgia. Laboratory tests revealed kidney and liver failure and he was transferred to the intensive care unit with suspected sepsis. His prior immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone and anakinra was stopped and empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated. During the diagnostic process, anemia, thrombocytopenia, highly elevated ferritin levels, C-reactive protein levels, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated soluble interleukin- (IL-) 2 receptor, and splenomegaly were detected. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and hemophagocytosis was demonstrated. The clinical picture was compatible with HLH/MAS according to current classification criteria, which have been developed for HLH in the context of sJIA []. Chemotherapy with etoposide and dexamethasone according to the HLH-94 protocol [] was started and the patient was transferred to our hospital in slightly improved condition.\nAfter one week, the patient deteriorated again with high fever, pancytopenia, and high levels of inflammatory markers. Physical examination on admission to our hospital was remarkable for cervical lymphadenopathy and severe tonsillopharyngitis. Computed abdominal tomography revealed hepatosplenomegaly as well as cervical and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Chemotherapy was stopped because neutropenic fever developed and the patient appeared septic. Second-line empirical antibiotic therapy was started and dexamethasone reduced to 20 mg/d. Microbiological testing revealed a primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection with positive anti-EBV-VCA-IgM antibodies and viral load of 104 copies/mL as determined by polymerase chain reaction.\nWe initiated treatment with rituximab once a week at a dose of 375 mg/m2 and achieved virus suppression after three cycles with undetectable copy numbers. Anakinra was reinstituted for AOSD and dexamethasone therapy continued at a dose of 8 mg/d. Blood count normalized and symptoms improved significantly, but quotidian fever and high levels of inflammatory values persisted. Addition of cyclosporine resulted in further clinical improvement of the patient and normalization of abnormal laboratory values. The patient course and the respective treatments are depicted in ."
"A 25-year-old African American woman initially presented to the hospital in 2014 with anosmia, blurry vision, and arthralgias. Subsequent serological evaluation led to a diagnosis of SLE (). She was started on disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily along with a tapering course of oral steroids. Her symptoms promptly improved. Her initial serological tests as shown in revealed a number of abnormal lupus markers. She also had low serum C3 and low serum C4. Interestingly, her CBCAPs were negative. The low C3 and C4 at the time were attributed to complement consumption from active SLE. Nine months later, when her SLE was quiescent, her serological makers were remeasured (). As shown in , she continued to show several abnormal lupus serologies. Her serum C3 and C4 continued to remain low, and her CBCAPs remained negative. Approximately 18 months after her initial SLE diagnosis, the patient was hospitalized for fever, headache, and sinusitis. While initially thought to be a SLE flare, her blood cultures subsequently grew Streptococcus pneumoniae and she was treated for sepsis with antibiotics and clinically improved. The bacteremia was attributed to her sinusitis. Labs checked during this hospitalization again revealed a low serum C3 and C4 of 88 mg/dl and 5 mg/dl, respectively. In addition, a measured total hemolytic complement activity assay (CH50) was <10 μ/ml (reference range: 31–60 μ/ml). On further questioning, the patient acknowledged having many prior episodes of sinusitis and respiratory infections."
"A 25-year-old male presented with periocular pain the day after sustaining a blunt trauma to the right eye with a piece of wood. At presentation, his best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1/10 in the right eye and 10/10 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 10 mmHg in the right and 12 mmHg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination of the right eye revealed mild eyelid edema, 1+ conjunctival injection, clear cornea, an anterior lens capsule rupture bissecting the lens capsule along the 7 to 11 o’clock line extending under the superior and inferior iris margins to the lens equator, and traumatic cataract that did not yet seriously impede visualization of the fundus (). Retinal examination done at this stage revealed no pathology in the posterior pole, midperipheral or peripheral retina.\nVisual acuity was 1/10 on the third day after the trauma; however, due to increasing lens opacity, it decreased to hand motions by day 7 (). B-scan ultrasonography and orbital computed tomography (CT) were performed to rule out foreign body and globe rupture and to document the patient’s current status. No intravitreal foreign body or retinal pathology was detected on B-scan ultrasonography (). Orbital CT revealed narrowed anterior chamber and increased lens volume and reflectivity compared to the healthy eye. Furthermore, the globe was observed to be intact and no fractures were detected in the bones of the orbit ().\nThe patient’s trauma was graded using the Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology (BETT) and Ocular Trauma Score (OTS). BETT grade C was determined based on the injury being closed globe and contusional as well as the patient’s visual acuity at presentation. No relative afferent pupillary defect was observed. The extent of the injury was zone II. The patient’s OTS raw points value was 90, corresponding to an OTS of 4.\nSurgery was planned to restore the visual acuity lost due to progressive traumatic cataract. The procedure consisted of entering the anterior chamber via a 2.8 mm clear cornea incision made temporally with 20 gauge MVR blades, trypan blue capsule staining under air and lens extraction by the bimanual irrigation/aspiration technique. A foldable, acrylic posterior capsule intraocular lens was implanted by injection into the sac and anterior capsulorhexis was performed in half-circles on the temporal and nasal sides in the pupillary plane. The zonules and posterior capsule were observed as intact after the procedure. The corneal incisions were closed using hydration, without sutures (). Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 on the first postoperative day."
"A 25-year-old obese woman with an intrauterine contraceptive device in place for two years presented to the ED with 7 days of dysuria and “colicky” nonradiating suprapubic pain which worsened one day earlier. She complained of a new fever and lower back pain in the past day, but no other infectious symptoms other than one year of occasional mild white vaginal discharge and trace vaginal spotting associated with the end of her menstruation. She stated a monogamous sexual relationship with no new partners. In triage, her temperature was 100.8 °F with otherwise unremarkable vital signs. On examination, she had moderate suprapubic tenderness. She also had tenderness in the right lower back. Because of obesity, costovertebral angle tenderness could not be definitively established. Subsequent point-of-care ultrasound demonstrated a maximal area of tenderness well inferior to the patient’s right kidney, which was relatively superior and medial, in this patient. A bimanual pelvic examination was then performed, demonstrating mild cervical erythema and localized tenderness in the right adnexal region. An endocervical swab was obtained for gonococcal and chlamydia testing. Urinalysis revealed moderate leukocyte esterase. The patient was empirically treated for pelvic inflammatory disease with intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline. She was also treated with oral cephalexin in the case of non-pyuric cystitis. The urine culture grew no organisms. The endocervical swab was positive for chlamydia. The patient was notified and advised to notify her partner. No complications were reported on a subsequent unrelated ED visit four months later."
"A 25-year-old man became brain-dead following a severe blunt head trauma was admitted to our hospital for organ donation. Surgery was performed with a median sternotomy and a midline laparotomy. During surgery a single left-sided IVC was observed; it originated from the confluence of the left and right common iliac veins and ascended vertically to the left side of the abdominal aorta and anterior to the ureter, receiving the right renal vein passing anterior to the aorta (). Expectedly, the left renal vein was shorter than normal. The IVC was in the left side of the aorta throughout the abdomen. After entering the thorax, the passage of IVC was posterior to the aorta toward the right atrium. There was no retrohepatic IVC in the case and drainage of hepatic veins were directly into the right atrium (). No associated anomaly was noted in this case."
"A 25-year-old man was brought to hospital after being unconscious and collapsed during a physical fight with someone. He was declared “dead on arrival.” Autopsy revealed an abrasion on the 5th and 6th intercostal space on the left side of the chest measuring 3.0 cm, and hemorrhages on the right pleura and its corresponding intercostal muscles. The heart was enlarged and dilated (weight 466 g) with an area of recent bruising measuring 2.0 cm × 1.5 cm between the right inferior vena cava and the right coronary sulcus of the posterior atrioventricular groove epicardium (Fig. A). From the perspective of the right atrium (RA), hemorrhage was present on the leading edge of the coronary sinus (Fig. B). Dissection of the right atrial wall showed the transmural hemorrhage that involved the coronary sinus (Fig. C). No lethal injuries were identified clinically or at the autopsy. Histological examination exposed infiltrating hemorrhages involving all layers of the orifice of coronary sinus, some necrotic myocardial cells with scattered inflammatory cells and a small amount of white thrombus attached to the corresponding subepicardial region. In addition to the foregoing lesions, a laceration was seen on the lower edge of the coronary sinus (Fig. D). There were no particular histological findings in other organs apart from slight congestion. No alcohol and drugs were detected. Consequently, it was considered that arrhythmia was induced by the AVN contusion and was regarded as the cause of death."
"A 25-year-old latin woman, working 8 h per day, 6 days a week, for the last 4 years as a gas station attendant had one gestation with miscarriage in the first half of pregnancy. Headache, dizziness irritability, asthenia and normal menstrual cycle were reported. A physical examination showed changes in the thyroid gland, nodules in the right lobe, and a nonspecific pulmonary auscultation. The attendant also reported being a former smoker and not having a family history of cancer.\nWas found in 1/100 metaphases a CCR involving 8 chromosomal breakpoints described as: 46,XX,der(1)t(1;4),der(4)t(1;4;?),ace(1),ace(1), (Fig. ). Hemogram showed mild neutopenia (1470 cells/mm3) and biochemistry tests revealed no changes compared to normal values as described in Table . On the other hand, the immunophenotypic analysis confirmed neutropenia (33.00%), with a lower NK cell count (2.28%), with all NK CD56+/CD16− (Table ; Fig. )."
"The patient is a 25-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic sinusitis who was brought to our emergency department by EMS for new-onset seizures. The patient had been complaining of weakness, frontal headache, sinus pain, and nasal congestion for the last 5 days. He was seen at a different emergency department three days before and discharged with a diagnosis of viral syndrome. On presentation to our department the patient was postictal and complained of neck stiffness, headache, congestion, and fever; he was placed in isolation due to concern for meningitis. Initial vital signs included a temperature of 103°F, heart rate of 112 beats per minute, 20 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 116/61 mmHg. On examination he was diaphoretic and lethargic but was fully oriented and able to answer questions. Cranial nerves two to twelve were intact with no focal neurologic deficits; the remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable except for bilateral frontal sinus tenderness to palpation.\nPoint-of-care glucose, complete blood count with differential, and basic metabolic panel were obtained, all within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was ordered to evaluate for suspicion of intracranial pathology, revealing 1.3 cm attenuation behind the frontal bone and severe frontal sinusitis (). At this point both neurosurgery and otolaryngology specialists were consulted. MRI with and without contrast were subsequently ordered, showing a 2.1 cm epidural lesion in the left frontal region producing minimal mass effect on the left frontal lobe ().\nWhile in the emergency department, the patient received Tylenol, empiric vancomycin, ceftriaxone, levetiracetam for primary seizure prevention, and dexamethasone to decrease intracranial edema. Over the next several hours the patient's fever decreased to 99°F and tachycardia resolved. However he still complained of frontal sinus pain and headache. The patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and scheduled for same-day craniotomy and sinusotomies. The patient was admitted to SICU for one week following the surgical intervention. His hospital course was uncomplicated. At the time of discharge the patient was asymptomatic, afebrile, and in stable condition. He was prescribed levetiracetam with follow-up after completion at neurosurgical, otolaryngology, and medicine clinics. Follow-up with the patient revealed two incidents of generalized seizures, likely due to postsurgical changes. Patient is kept on levetiracetam and doing well."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) in the winter with 3 days of increasing dyspnea, “barking” cough, and fever. Past medical history was significant for attention deficit disorder. Family and social histories were unremarkable. Medications included amphetamine/dextromethorphan and an oral contraceptive. Blood pressure was normal, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. There was inspiratory stridor, nasal flaring, paradoxical abdominal breathing, and accessory respiratory muscle use. Laboratory data was significant for a white blood cell count of 19,800 per microliter (normal: 4,000–10,000 per microliter). Admission chest radiograph demonstrated subglottic narrowing ().\nIn the ED, she was given 3 doses of nebulized racemic epinephrine with improvement in stridor and work of breathing. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU), where she remained tachypneic with stridor and paradoxical abdominal breathing. She was treated with intravenous dexamethasone and started on a 70 : 30 ratio of helium-to-oxygen mixture. Stridor resolved and there was visible improvement in the work of breathing immediately after starting the helium-oxygen mixture.\nWithin 24 hours, there was complete resolution of stridor without a requirement for escalation of care. Respiratory viral nucleic acid amplification test was positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Chest radiograph the day after admission demonstrated complete resolution of subglottic narrowing (). The patient was transferred out of the MICU on hospital day 3 and discharged home on hospital day 5 with a diagnosis of laryngotracheitis secondary to RSV."
"A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks mild abdominal pain and purulent discharge from the umbilicus. He denied any urinary tract symptoms and medical history. Physical examination revealed periumbilical redness with umbilical discharge. Upon admission to the hospital, the patient had a body temperature of 38.6°C, blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, heart rate of 90 beats/minute, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/minute. Laboratory results included hemoglobin, 12.5 g/dL; white blood cell count, 13,400/mm3; and platelets, 255,000/mm3. Abdominopelvic CT detected an infraumbilical cystic mass in the midline with inflammatory changes extending to the bladder dome (). Treatment with antibiotics was started before elective surgery."
"A 25-year-old Dominican woman with no medical history was admitted to the department of infectious diseases at Pointe-à-Pitre University hospital with tonic-clonic generalized seizures. She had been living in Guadeloupe for 1 year, had never left the Dominican Republic before moving to Guadeloupe and had never had any focal neurological sign nor seizure before. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed multiple brain lesions consisting of calcified cysts and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed one postero-frontal cyst sheltering a scolex at vesicular stage (Fig. ), which fulfilled the diagnosic criteria for definite NCC [, ]. Another lesion was surrounded by parenchymal edema, reflecting degenerative changes observed in NCC at the colloidal stage (Fig. ). Fundus evaluation was normal and no extraneural localization was clinically found. X ray of legs and arms showed no extraneural “cigar shaped calcification” in muscles or soft tissues. The detection of anticysticercal antibodies by serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (EIA IBL-Diasorin®) was negative. CSF analysis showed no abnormality (2 WBC/mm3, normal proteins = 0.46 g/L, normal glucose level = 3.3 g/L in CSF and 4.3 g/L in blood, negative bacterial culture) and enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) assay for detection of antibodies to T. solium glycoprotein antigens on CSF was negative (LDBIO diagnostics®). Stool specimen examination for T. solium eggs by microscopy was negative for our patient and all members of her household. No EEG was performed before treatment. She was treated with antiepileptic (valproic acid 500 mg twice daily) and anti-parasitic therapy (albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 14 days) with an adjuvant 14-day dose-reducing course of corticosteroids (dexamethasone 7 mg (0.1 mg/kg) a day for 3 days, then prednisone 70 mg a day for 7 days, then 30 mg for 4 days) []. The patient suffered from several focal seizures (clonic movement of the lower leg without impairment of consciousness) with no focal neurological deficit after tapering out cortisone and a generalized seizure 6 month after initiation of treatment. Control MRI at 6 months showed degeneration of the cysts (Fig. , and ), control EEG was normal but valproate dose was increased to avoid further seizures. At 9 months of follow-up, neurological examination was normal without further seizure activity with 2000 mg per day of valproic acid."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted to our medical center after experiencing prolonged weakness and splenomegaly. A complete blood cell analysis indicated a white blood cell count of 81,190/μL, a platelet count of 206,000/μL, and a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL. Peripheral blood analysis showed all stages of neutrophilic maturation, with 1% myeloblasts, 4% promyelocytes, 10% myelocytes, 17% metamyelocytes, 2% eosinophils and 9% basophils. Bone marrow aspirates revealed that the patient was in the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), with 2.5% myeloblasts, 5.5% promyelocytes, 13% myelocytes, 13% metamyelocytes, 1.5% eosinophils and 9% basophils. A multiplex PCR screen for gene fusions typical of leukemia was negative. Chromosome analysis of the bone marrow showed the presence of 46,XY,t (5;17) (q32;q11) []. Subsequently, dual-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) proved positive for PDGFRB gene rearrangement. After one week of imatinib treatment at 400 mg/day, the patient achieved CHR. This dosage was then decreased to 200 mg/day, and the patient acquired CCyR three months later. Thereafter, the patient took 100 mg/day, and at the final follow-up (26 months later), the patient still remained in complete remission."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with a two-year history of left neck and facial spasms, as well as migraines. Physical exam was significant for bilateral clonus as well as brisk bilateral deep tendon reflexes. MRI scans were performed twice, separated by 10 months. The first set of imaging demonstrated a small lesion of the left cerebellar hemisphere near the vermis with moderate compression of the posterior left midbrain. The lesion did not enhance on the first set of imaging, but did enhance on the more recent MRI. Following discussions with the patient and the family, both opted for surgical resection.\nWith the help of stereotactic navigation, a linear incision was made from the inion to the top of C2. A suboccipital craniotomy was subsequently performed. The Leica microscope with the attached Stryker Cranial Navigation System were then registered to the position, with a plan for a supracerebellar approach. At this point, a trajectory was planned and the microscope was fixed in place with the crosshairs of the microscope fixed to target the lesion. The VBAS was then placed in line with the crosshairs after a small incision of the pia mater was made. The VBAS was subsequently advanced within the crosshairs, and the focus of the microscope was adjusted as the VBAS depth was changed. The lesion was encountered after blunt dissection. The retractor was left without firm attachment to a retractor arm to permit a full range of motion during resection. A grayish circumscribed lesion was delineated from the brainstem. Gross total resection was achieved, and pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma WHO I. The patient had no neurological complications postoperatively."
"A 25-year-old woman underwent total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node dissection with histopathologic diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Three months after surgery, 5550 MBq (150 mCi) of I-131 was administered for thyroid remnant ablation. Post treatment WBS on the 7th day of treatment demonstrated intense uptake corresponding to thyroid remnant tissue and a heterogeneous radioiodine uptake in the sacral region, prominently in the posterior image (). Initial interpretation was suspicious for sacral metastasis. No other abnormal focus was determined elsewhere in the whole body. The serum thyroglobulin level was 13.6 ng/ml and anti-thyroglobulin was 196.4 U/ml, while thyroid stimulating hormone value was 123.9 mIU/ml. Because of the patient’s pelvic pain complaint and intermediate-high risk according to thyroglobulin level, a technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan was also performed. The osteoblastic phase of the bone scan demonstrated normal bone uptake and absence of the left kidney (). We routinely perform 2-5-minute whole-body blood-pool imaging in our department, especially in case of whole-body tumor and metastasis evaluation with MDP bone scan. In some cases, the normal kidneys and urinary system can be cleared thoroughly in MDP bone scan and ectopic kidneys can be confusing. When the blood-pool phase was analyzed, absence of the left renal activity and an extra focus of uptake in the sacral region due to pelvic kidney was noticed (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patient confirmed the ectopic kidney located in the left posterior pelvic region overlying the sacrum with an anteriorly rotated renal pelvis ()."
"A 25-year-old Chinese woman with no significant medical history presented with lower back pain and left lower limb weakness and numbness for 1 year. No remarkable neurological signs were found except left ankle showed oversupination.\nMRI imaging showed an epidural mass at L3–L4 level. The mass was T2 hyperintense, hypointense in fat suppressed T2 and showed no enhancement in dynamic contrast-enhanced images (Fig. ).\nThe patient underwent lumbar laminectomy and this revealed a grey yellowish tumor mass with a final pathologic measurement of 2.5 cm × 1.5 cm × 0.2 cm.\nPathological examination confirmed an angiolipoma composed of mature adult fat cells and numerous small vascular channels containing red blood cells and fibrin thrombi. Immunohistochemistry showed CK(−), CD31(+), CD34(+), S-100(+), SMA(+), Ki-67(2%+).\nThe patient had an uneventful recovery after the surgery, and remained asymptomatic at 2 month follow-up checkup."
Patient 1. A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency room with an intracranial complication secondary to the chronic otitis media as shown in a CT scan (). He was diagnosed and treated when neurologically stable. In this case the vestibular damage has occurred progressively over many years and as such was successfully compensated. The affected ear was the left; the fistula sign was negative (no nystagmus under rubber bulb applied pressure to the external ear) but the bedside head impulse test was positive due to the appearance of intense refixation saccades that indicated a major vestibular deficit.
"A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on 28 February 2011 presenting with hypertension for ∼20 months. She had no gross hematuria, weight loss, and no flank pain. Physical examination revealed the blood pressure was 200/130 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa). No palpable lesion was found in the thyroid gland and abdominal examination showed no abnormalities. There was no history of hypertension in her family and her past medical history is not contributory. Results of routine laboratory tests, including blood regular test, urine analysis, and biochemical investigations of renal, liver, and thyroid function parameters, were all within normal limits. Urinalysis was normal. Radiographically, chest X-ray was negative and abdominal ultrasound showed the presence of an echo-inhomogeneous mass in right kidney. Non-contrast computer tomography (CT) demonstrated a heterogeneous and well-circumscribed soft tissue mass measuring about 30 mm adjacent to the right renal hilum, and there was no evidence of capsule penetration or infiltrative growth pattern. Most renal parenchyma structures were normal and obvious calcification was detected in the lesion (Fig. ). No enlarged lymph nodes were found in retroperitoneal space. Post-contrast CT revealed moderately inhomogeneous enhancement after contrast (Fig. ). All this combined with radiological finding and clinical presentation led to the diagnosis of reninoma and the patient underwent surgical exploration. During surgery, a 3-cm mass extended to the right renal hilum. The patient successfully underwent nephron sparing surgery with an uneventful recovery. Hypertension returned to normal without any medication interference. Two years after surgery, the patient is still in good health without recurring disease or related hypertension."
"A 25-year-old previously healthy woman presented to the emergency department without any significant past medical history. She had a 30-pound unintentional weight loss, fatigue, and weakness that began three months prior. The patient denied any abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, and hematemesis. Her entire physical examination was negative, including the absence of jaundice. Laboratory values revealed that hemoglobin and bilirubin metabolites were normal, but inflammatory markers, including CRP, were elevated. In addition, alkaline phosphatase, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and white cell count were all elevated. The remaining laboratory values were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained and revealed a large periampullary diverticulum containing a fluid level with wall thickening, mucosal enhancement, and surrounding fat stranding consistent with duodenal diverticulitis. The diverticulum appeared to cause common bile duct compression with resultant upstream dilation of intrahepatic biliary ducts (Figures -).\nIn addition, the stomach and proximal duodenum were dilated with air-fluid levels concerning for proximal obstruction. Surgery was consulted and decided immediate surgical intervention was not warranted. Surgery did have some suspicion that the patient may have an underlying malignancy and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) was obtained to better characterize the biliary ductal dilation. This re-demonstrated a periampullary duodenal diverticulum with adjacent inflammatory changes. The inflamed diverticulum caused a mass effect of the distal intrapancreatic common bile duct with resultant dilatation of the proximal common bile duct measuring up to 1.8 cm. Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation was once again seen (Figure ).\nOtherwise, the other abdominal organs were normal. The patient was subsequently made nil per os (NPO) and an NG tube was placed for decompression and suction. She completed a 14-day course of intravenous antibiotics, including metronidazole and levofloxacin. Follow-up CT two weeks later revealed a significant decrease in the inflammation, and the patient tolerated advancing diet (Figure ).\nSurgery considerations were postponed at this point in time due to reduction of inflammation and asymptomatic patient. Follow-up laboratory values revealed normalization of the previously elevated alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT levels."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with anaphylactic reaction during a septoplasty, turbinectomy, and maxillary sinusectomy. Midazolam hydrochloride, fentanyl, and propofol were used for anesthesia induction. Chlorhexidine was used for mucosal and skin antisepsis. Approximately after 30 minutes the patient had periorbital edema, hives, hypotension wheezing, and decreased oxygen saturation. Promethazine 0.1 mg was administered intramuscularly, hydrocortisone 500 mg was administered intravenously, and 0.5 ml of epinephrine 1 : 1,000 was administered intramuscularly in the vastus lateralis muscle of the tight, resulting in immediate clinical improvement.\nIn order to identify the cause of anaphylaxis, the patient was referred to the Allergy and Immunology Department of the Hospital of the School of Medical and Health Sciences (SUPREMA), Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The prick test and intradermal test were carried out with drugs used during the surgery, namely, chlorhexidine, lidocaine, cephalothin, acetylcysteine, chloramphenicol, cephalosporin, midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol. The prick test was also performed with latex. Both allergic tests were positive for chlorhexidine and negative for the other substances. After a detailed anamnesis, the patient reported prior lip swelling when mouthwash containing chlorhexidine gluconate was used.\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient and all work was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (1964)."
"In Nov 2014, a 25-year-old woman with past history of beta-thalassemia major was admitted to the hospital with right hemiparesis. She was a known case of beta-thalassemia major with regular blood transfusion until 9 years old. The mean hemoglobin of patient was 9 gr/dl. But she had twice hemolysis after transfusion, and after this situation, she refused to receive blood transfusion. She did not take any drug after this side effect. She had past history of gallbladder stone one month before the current hemiparesis and had undergone cholecystectomy. In this stage the mean Hb was 7 gr/dl, so before the surgery she received blood transfusion. In this admission, on general examination, she was undernourished with a short stature. Head and neck examination revealed depressed cranial vault, frontal bossing, retracted upper lip, and saddle nose (severe face deformity due to extramedullary hematopoiesis). On neurological examination, she was right hemiparesis (force: 3/5); her cranial nerves and sensory function were intact. In paraclinic tests, Hb was 3.4 gr/dl and echocardiography showed increased aortic flow. Abdominal sonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Brain MRI showed hypersignal intensity in left cortical watershed area (). Brain MRA and CT angiography showed chronic total occlusion of left internal carotid artery at from C2 till C5 segment (). In transcranial duplex study of cervical and cerebral vessels, internalization of left external carotid artery, reverse flow of left anterior cerebral artery, and high peak systolic velocities (PSV > 125 cm/s) in all transcranial vessels were shown. After blood transfusion without any thrombotic or anticoagulant drugs, hemiparesis was improved in three days.\nDue to severe anemia after 3 months, she had undergone splenectomy and anemia was improved. Before surgery the mean Hb was 6 gr/dl and after that the mean Hb increased to 9 gr/dl and serum ferritin was 1500 mg/l. After 6 months of follow-up, modified Rankin scale was zero and transcranial duplex showed normal PSV."
"A 25-year-old man was referred with complaints of aural fullness and tinnitus in the left ear for months. Oral antihistamines and corticosteroids nasal spray were prescribed by the primary care physician to treat allergic disease-related Eustachian tube dysfunction. After treatment for 2 months, symptoms of tinnitus had become intermittent but not completely subsided, and the sensation of aural fullness had persisted, although pure tone audiometry showed normal hearing thresholds. Normal middle ear function bilaterally was also characterized by a Type A tympanogram, normal static immittance, and normal crossed and uncrossed reflex thresholds.\nNasoendoscopic examinations revealed Grade 2 adenoid hypertrophy abutting the torus tubarius, and this could have been contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient decided to have adenoidectomy surgery. Postoperatively, the patient gradually lost the sensation of aural fullness and tinnitus, and he remained free from the above symptoms over the next 12 months."
"The patient was a 25-year-old man and presented with a history of prior septomeatoplasty to treat nasal obstruction 2 years earlier. However, the patient remained symptomatic despite surgical treatment. Furthermore, postnasal drip and aural fullness were also noted. Hearing tests including PTA and tympanometry showed normal results. Nasoendoscopic examinations revealed a widely patent meatus with partially resected inferior turbinates. With the scope moving forward, a huge hypertrophic adenoid was found to block the choanae, and this was characterized as Grade 4 adenoid hypertrophy. After adenoidectomy with the PEAK PlasmaBlade, the patient reported significant relief of his nasal obstruction. Aural fullness subsided, and the patient remained free from this symptom over a 10-month follow-up period."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with a chief complaint of pain in the posterior upper left region for the past few days. Familial history and extraoral findings were non-contributory. On intraoral examination, a carious lesion was present in #15 and the tooth was non-tender on palpation. Maxillary arch showed buccally erupted supernumerary tooth #28 and mandibular arch showed lingually erupted supernumerary #45 ( ). Panoramic radiograph revealed multiple (7 in number) impacted and erupted supernumerary premolars in the mandibular arch (). In the left maxillary molar region, erupted para-premolar supernumerary teeth were present. In the right mandibular premolar region, erupted supernumerary teeth were present interdentally at #45/#46 and impacted supernumerary at #44/#45, respectively (). In the eft mandibular premolar region, erupted supernumerary teeth were present interdentally at #34/#35 and 3 impacted supernumerary teeth at #34/#35, respectively, as interradicular teeth."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of a superotemporal bulbar conjunctival mass in the left eye. At a previous ophthalmic clinic, she had complained of a foreign body sensation. On suspicion of OSSN, a conjunctival biopsy was performed that revealed no malignant (Ki-67+) cells but an inflammatory lesion that contained CD3+ T cells and CD20+ B cells. She was treated with a topical steroid and topical antibiotics for 8 months, but the lesion persisted. When the patient was referred to our clinic, a slit-lamp examination revealed a granulomatous mass and calcium deposits in the center of a granuloma along with vascular injection on the superior bulbar conjunctiva (Fig. ). The cornea was relatively clear with no epithelial defects (Fig. ). We asked about a history of blepharoptosis surgery, and the patient had had upper blepharoplasty 5 years earlier. With eversion of the upper lid, diffuse papillary reaction and an exposed nonabsorbable suture were detected on the superior palpebral conjunctiva near the medial canthal area of the fornix (Fig. ). After the suture was removed (Fig. ), the granulomatous mass with calcific deposits was completely resolved (Fig. )."
"A 25 year-old woman was diagnosed with post-transfusion HIV infection in 1987. In April 2000, the patient had a CD4+ count of 154 cells/mL with an HIV RNA viral load of 1,610 copies/mL. She initiated cART with efavirenz (EFV) plus AZT and 3TC, but had poor adherence until she voluntarily abandoned cART in February 2002. The patient did not achieve an undetectable HIV viral load during the on-cART period. In August 2001, she was diagnosed with HCV genotype 3 infection, with a viral load of 550,000 IU/mL. Between 2002 and 2006, the patient voluntarily continued interruption of cART and had successive detectable HCV RNA viral loads (between 134,000 and 1,380 IU/mL). In August 2005, a liver biopsy was performed, which was compatible with a diagnosis of cirrhosis. The patient also showed a platelet count of 41,000 cells/mL, total bilirubin of 2.4 mg/dL, albumin of 3.90 g/dL, and an INR of 1.3 (Child-PT score of 6).\nUltrasound findings showed splenomegaly (15cm) and portal hypertension (15mm). In March 2006, the patient had a CD4+ count of 88 cells/mL, HIV viral load of 808 copies/mL and HCV with a viral load of 1,270 IU/mL. The patient then initiated treatment with SQV/rtv plus emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TDF). In April 2007, her CD4+ count was 127 cells/mL and she achieved undetectable HIV and HCV viral loads. At that point, the liver stiffness measurement using transient elastography was suggestive of liver cirrhosis (21.8 kPa). Her HIV and HCV viral loads remained negative until May 2015, when the patient died of colorectal cancer."
"A 25-year-old gravida four para two presented at our emergency department with complaints of generalized abdominal pain of six hours duration of acute onset and dizziness. The pain was aggravated upon lying down and radiated to both shoulders. She was in her second week of amenorrhea.\nHer obstetric history included one pregnancy termination at 18th weeks due to multiple foetal anomalies three years prior. In addition, she had undergone laparoscopic right salpingectomy due to right tubal pregnancy two years before.\nOn examination, a mild degree of pallor was noticed. Her pulse and blood pressure were 105 bpm and 90/60 mm Hg, respectively. Her abdominal examination revealed generalized tenderness. Her vaginal examination revealed cervical tenderness, and her fornices were full. Transvaginal US examination revealed an empty uterine cavity, free abdominal fluid and coagulum in the cul-de-sac. At the time of admission, serum level of ß-hCG was >10000 IU/L. A complete blood count on the day of admission revealed a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL.\nThe clinical and ultrasonographic findings were suggestive of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The patient’s consent was taken for an emergency exploratory laparotomy, which showed a massive hemoperitoneum and a ruptured right interstitial pregnancy. The site of the bleeding was clamped, and cornual resection with the conception products inside was done (). Uterine cornu was sutured separately with 0-Vicyrl. The ovaries, left fallopian tube one1 unit of fresh frozen plasma.\nThe postoperative period was uneventful. Her hematological and clinical biochemistry values were within normal range on her immediate postoperative follow-up and postoperative day 1. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day and called for the control examination a week later. The control examination findings showed no significance, and the histopathology report of the specimen confirmed interstitial ectopic pregnancy. Serum β-hCG level decreased by 98 % at postoperative day 7."
"A 25-year-old white man was referred to our laser clinic for evaluation and possible treatment of a protuberant and extensive vascular lesion on his lower lip, which had been long bothering him on aesthetic and functional grounds. The lesion was of violaceous color, nearly involving the entire left side of the lower lip, showing a deep infiltration and extension to the buccal mucosa (Figs. and ). On palpation, the lesion was soft and resilient. According to the patient’s history, the lesion had been present since birth. He was first treated with corticosteroids when he was 6 years old, to no avail. This was followed by a surgical intervention, which had provided some reduction of the lesion’s size.\nThis whole information led to the diagnosis of a vascular malformation. Taking into account the size of the lesion and its potential risk for bleeding, the best therapeutic option for the present case was, under local anesthesia, the use of a high-intensity diode laser in a noninvasive pattern, since it has shown to be effective and safety for the patient as a surgical intervention [, ].\nA high intensity, 3-W diode laser (DMC, São Carlos, Brazil) in a non-contact technique was used. Irradiation was delivered using a flexible quartz fiber of 300 μm in diameter, which was kept 2-3 mm away from the lesion, in continuous wave mode with a mean fluency of 20 J/cm2, proceeding with quick circular movements in restricting area of approximately 1 cm2, starting on the borders of the lesion. The endpoint of the laser delivering was a sign of blanching on the lesion’s surface (Figs. and ), at which stage the laser was moved to another area. This procedure allows to gradually irradiate the whole lesion. In each session, this procedure was repeated three times with one minute interval between each irradiation to prevent heat damage. Each irradiation session lasted about 15 minutes; the patient’s discomfort was minimal and there was no bleeding. Just after irradiation, the patient developed slight and temporary swelling of the treated area, for which it was necessary to use anti-inflammatory medication. The whole treatment required 4 sessions at intervals of about 1.5 month each (Figs. and ), thus allowing for recovery of the patient and the shrinking of the lesion between the sessions. The last evaluation made after 2.5 years since last irradiation showed that the technique applied on this case had yielded a marked reduction of volume of the lesion along with a very satisfactory cosmetic result (Figs. and )."
"The female patient was the first-born child of unrelated parents, a 25-year-old mother and a 23-year-old father. Her mother is healthy, and her father and paternal grandmother are diagnosed of bipolar disorder. She has a healthy brother. After 42 weeks of pregnancy, she was born by caesarean section due to lack of expansion. Her birth weight was 2740 g (10–25th percentile). She had neonatal eating disorders, and she did not cry until her first year of age. Clinical examination at 5 years of age noted some dysmorphic features such as microcephaly, round face, hypertrichosis, low anterior hairline, sparse hair with abundant hair fall, hypotelorism, synophrys, small and low-set ears, concave nasal ridge, thick lips, widely spaced teeth, and micrognathia. Her weight and height were low (3–10th percentile), and she has no significant congenital anomalies, apart from abnormal pigmentation of the skin, dystrophic toenails, clinodactyly, and short fingers. She has moderate intellectual disability with motor and speech delay. She could not walk until the age of 18 months, and at the age of examination, she has poor coordination and begins to talk with speech therapist's help. She attends a regular school with personalized support. She has no sleep disorder and is sociable."
"A previously healthy 25-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of chest pain. His history was unremarkable. Physical examination did not reveal any significant findings. A CT scan revealed a 7.6 × 6.5 × 3.5 cm mass in the anterior mediastinum and no metastases at the initial diagnosis. His laboratory values included an AFP level of 3,034 ng/mL and an hCG level of 20.6 ng/mL. Ultrasonography of the testes revealed a uniform pattern without any findings suggestive of malignancy. Needle core biopsy was not performed. Based on suspicion for PMGCT, the patient was referred for thoracic surgery. The tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as a yolk sac tumor. After the operation, the patient received 4 total courses of BEP and EP chemotherapy. Upon completion of the chemotherapy, his serum tumor marker levels normalized (). The patient is alive and in CR without any evidence of recurrence after 3 years."
"A 25 year old man developed a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma of the right proximal femur extending into the hip joint. This was curatively excised with extra-articular resection and reconstructed with a coned pelvis with a subsequent unremarkable recovery (Fig. ).\nAlmost 3 years following treatment his wound became inflamed and a deep abscess developed, which on aspiration grew staphylococcus epidermidis. The patient had the first stage of his revision completed (Fig. ). As the infection was found to be contained relatively distally, the coned pelvic segment was preserved."
"A 25-year-old woman referred to emergency ward of Shahid Beheshti Hospital of Qom due to vertigo, drop attack and one episode of convulsion from the previous day. At initial evaluation, she was unable to move and her upper and lower extremities were spastic.\nShe had a lupus pneumonitis one month ago which was treated. The patient had a slight fever and initial laboratory tests revealed WBC 6800, Hb 11 mg/dL, PLT 188000, PT 15.2, INR 1.5 and PTT 37. She had blurred vision one day after admission. Based on the antecedents of the patient and suspecting neurological pulmonary presentations, immunosuppressive treatment with infusion of cyclophosphamide (1g Stat) and methylprednisolone (1g/day for 3 days) was initiated and brain MRI was performed. Lab tests showed ANA 2.9, Anti dsDNA 0.8, lupus anticoagulan Ab 42sec (Nl= 30-44), anticardiolipin IgG 6.3 IU/mL (NL <12), anticardiolipin IgM 4.6 IU/mL (NL <12), and anti beta-2 glycoprotein IgG 3 IU/mL (NL <10). Brain MRI showed disseminated white matter signal in periventricular area which extended to subcortical area and contained low T2 sequence which could be suggestive of infectious diseases. According to the MRI mode and endemic area, neurobrucellosis was suspected and 2ME and Wright tests were done. Wight was 1.5120 while 2ME was 1.640 which were strongly positive. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample was taken during the lumbopuncture (LP) disclosed Wright (1/160) with IgM 22.2 IU/mL (pos>22). So, the patient was treated with neurobrucellosis diagnosis, but unfortunately 4 days later, after respiratory apnea, she was pronounced dead."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with progressively worsening left-sided chest pain and dyspnea on exertion over the past four days. His medical history was notable for coronary artery disease and has had seven stents placed since the age of 18. He also had a history of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. Subsequent history revealed 11 pack years of smoking and noncompliance with medication regimens, hemodialysis schedule, and nutrition therapy. There was no family history of premature cardiovascular disease.\nCardiac enzyme values were as follows: troponin 0.05 ng/mL, creatine kinase 36 U/L, and CK-MB 2.2 ng/mL. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST depression in leads I, II, and V4-6. Cardiac enzyme values obtained about six hours later suggested the evolving nature of MI: 0.07 ng/mL, creatine kinase 33 U/L, and CK-MB 3.5 ng/mL. The last set of cardiac enzymes collected 18 hours from the initial presentation were troponin 1.12 ng/mL, creatine kinase 73 U/L, and CK-MB 15.9 ng/mL.\nTransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 55%. Coronary angiogram (Figure ) revealed 70 to 80% in-stent restenosis at the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Obtuse marginal branch of left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) also had a complex 90 to 99% stenosis with in-stent restenosis at the ostium. In the right coronary artery (RCA), 60 to 70% stenosis just distal to the posterior descending artery (PDA) was noted.\nIn view in-stent restenosis in multiple coronary vessels and evolving nature of MI, an urgent five-quintuple CABG was chosen over percutaneous intervention with stent placement. Bilateral internal mammary arteries (IMAs) and left greater saphenous vein (GSA) were harvested via median sternotomy and endoscopy, respectively. CABG consisted of left IMA to the main LAD, right IMA to the obtuse marginal branch of LCX and first diagonal branch of the LAD (with inflow into the RIMA graft from LIMA), and left GSA to the second diagonal branch of the LAD and the PDA of the RCA.\nFollowing the operation, the patient was transferred to critical care unit in stable condition. The patient showed an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on day 6 of hospital admission. At one-month follow-up, CT angiography confirmed patency of the grafts. The patient also reported complete resolution of angina and dyspnea."
"A 25-year-old young married Bangladeshi-Bengali female was brought to the emergency department by her relatives with the presentation of an impaired level of consciousness after intentionally ingesting 100 × 25 mg (2500 mg total) tablets of amitriptyline approximately 10 h prior to arrival. There was no suicide note written but found 10 empty strips, each containing 10 tablets that indicated the patient had taken 100 tablets of 25 mg amitriptyline. She had a history of disharmony with her husband. 2 years backward, she incised her left forearm by blade deliberately.\nAt the emergency, blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg, heart rate 140 beats-per-min, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min with oxygen saturation 95% on room air, temperature 103 °F, Glasgow coma scale 10/15 as she opened his eyes to verbal response, localized painful stimuli and spoke inappropriate words (E2, M5, V3). Abdominal examination revealed distended urinary bladder. There was no lateralizing sign in the neurological examination. ECG revealed wide complex tachycardia (Fig. ) with QRS duration 178 ms. Blood pH was 7.36. She immediately transferred to a cardiac coronary unit (CCU) for monitoring and management purpose, where she was treated initially with 100 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonates in an undiluted state given intravenously over 5 min. Heart rate back to 115 beats-per-min within 10 min after infusion of sodium bicarbonate. In the limb leads, QRS duration came to 100 ms and in chest leads, ST/T wave changes were seen on ECG (Fig. ). Over the next 24 h, sodium bicarbonate infusion consisting of 125 ml dissolved in 375 ml normal saline was started and titrated according to the report of arterial blood gas analysis done 6 h to maintain the pH 7.5–7.55. Initially, sodium bicarbonate infusion started at a rate of 100 ml/h. A total dose of 600 mmol sodium bicarbonate was required in 24 h. Other investigations—serum electrolyte, random blood sugar was normal. On Day 2, as she did not regain his consciousness, intravenous lipid emulsion 500 ml was given over 2 h after 24 h of admission. Afterward that, she regained her consciousness completely. Sodium bicarbonate infusion was tapered slowly and stopped it later. Her serum electrolytes done at the end of Day 2 were also normal. In ECG, ST/T wave abnormality persisted (Fig. ). On Day 3, she was transferred to post-CCU and evaluated by a psychiatrist. On Day 4, she was discharged with following heart rate 124/min with QRS duration in the limb lead 90 ms in ECG along with other normal vital signs."
"A 25-year-old man, Middle Eastern origin, history of exposure to livestock was admitted to our unit complaining of a painful swelling of the right elbow. The swelling developed over 3 years and was associated with recent pain without fever or rigors, and pruritus. Anamnesis did not reveal any trauma to the elbow or prior medication.\nHe was afebrile on admission with good general conditions, and physical examination revealed a tender right lateral elbow mass with distension of overlying skin. Mass measured 4 cm by 6 cm and there were no signs of excoriations nor fistula (Fig. ).\nOn day 3, patient became febrile with a temperature of 38.8 °C. Lab test demonstrated a normal total WBC count of 5.0 × 109 cells/L, eosinophil level of 158 cells/L, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 15 mm/h. Liver function tests were unremarkable. Hydatid serology was negative and there was no modification in the appearance of the mass.\nPlain elbow and chest radiographs were also unremarkable albeit diffuse soft tissue swelling of the elbow: there were no bone erosions nor calcifications. Ultrasound came back for a cystic lesion of the elbow with several floating membranes without color Doppler test. Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) depicted a unilocular cyst with multiple septations giving it a multivesicular or rosette appearance, confined to the soft tissues, adjacent to the medial elbow muscles without infiltrating bone nor surrounding neurovascular structures (Figs. and ).\nPatient was prepared for elective surgery with consent and antihelminthic therapy was initiated preoperatively for 5 days. En block surgical excision of the mass under general anesthesia was undertaken. Care was taken to remove the mass en block without perforating the cyst wall, through meticulous pericystectomy along surrounding muscle fibers (Fig. ). The cyst was multivesicular containing daughter cysts and were filled with muddy substance typical of hydatid disease (Fig. ). After excision, extensive washout of the surgical field was carried out. Wound could not be closed due to massive soft tissue loss (Fig. ).\nThe operating field was covered with adequate dressing. Cutaneous skin flap was done subsequently with favorable outcome and no signs of local recurrence 2 years after surgery."
"A 25 year old man with a history of orchidopexy was treated for NS stage I by orchidectomy of the right testis. Histopathological examination revealed a pure EC. At primary diagnosis the B-HCG level was increased (3.4 U/L, Fig. a) with a normal AFP level and an unknown LDH level (Supplementary Table , and not shown). No serum was available for retrospective miR analysis at this time point. The patient was followed-up by active surveillance. Four years after diagnosis the B-HCG level was found to be increased (144 U/L) (Fig. a) and a retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis was detected by CT imaging. Retrospective analysis showed that the miR-371a-3p level was elevated at the time of relapse (Supplementary Table and Fig. b, arrow). The miR-373-3p level was below cut-off level (Fig. c). The patient was treated with three cycles of BEP and a complete remission was achieved with a total follow-up of nine years. A single positive score for miR-373-3p and miR-371a-3p (just above cut-off level) was obtained seven years after primary diagnosis, but without known clinical consequences."
"A 3.1 Kg, male infant, born to 25 years old primigravida mother at 40 weeks of gestation. He was noted to have severe respiratory distress soon after birth for which he was transported to our hospital for further management. At admission, he was sick with tachycardia, tachypnea and central cyanosis. His SpO2 was 60% with 6L/minute of 100% oxygen. There was diminished air entry on left hemithorax and his abdomen was scaphoid. Emergency endotracheal intubation was performed and he was commenced on ventilatory support. Ventilatory settings were adjusted to meet adequate oxygenation. The possibilities considered were congenital diaphragmatic hernia, pneumonia, congenital lung malformations and congenital heart disease. Nasogastric tube reached the stomach without any difficulty.\nHe was started on parenteral nutrition and IV antibiotics following performing work-up for sepsis. His CBC at admission revealed leucocytosis. His CRP test was positive. His blood culture collected at the time of admission remained sterile. His metabolic parameters and coagulation profile were normal. His chest skiagram revealed congenital eventration of left diaphragm, gas distended bowel loops in the left hemithorax with a shift of mediastinum to the right and over distended stomach, with suspicion of gastric volvulus (Fig.). The baby deteriorated with bleeding from nasogastric tube and frank bleeding per rectum on day 3 of admission. Possibilities considered were sepsis, coagulopathy and gastric ischemia. His coagulation profile was deranged and there was fall in hematocrit which was treated with FFP and PRBC transfusion. There was discoloration of left hemithorax. Gastrograffin study was performed which revealed mesentro-axial type of gastric volvulus in left hemithorax (Fig.). He underwent emergency surgery through left subcostal incision. Intra-operatively there was a mesentro-axial type of gastric volvulus with distension and congestion of stomach (Fig.). Detorsion of stomach, plication of left dome of diaphragm and anterior gastropexy was performed. He tolerated the procedure well without any intra and post-operative complications. He was gradually weaned off ventilator and extubated to oxygen by prongs on day 14 of life. He further required oxygen supplementation for 4 days, after which he could be weaned to room air. Orogastric tube feeds were initiated on day 18 of life and were graded up as tolerated by the infant. Direct breast feeds were initiated on day 26 of life and have been accepted by the infant satisfactorily thereafter. At discharge his surgical wound had healed well. His clinical physical examination was within normal limits. He is on regular follow up and doing well with normal growth parameters and development."
"A pregnant woman aged 25 years was admitted to the obstetrical department of Kharkiv Municipal Perinatal clinic with the onset of regular uterine contractions at a term of the 41 weeks. The NI-FECG revealed multiple dropped beats on the ECG (Fig. ) and on the fetal heart rate (FHR) tracing (Fig. ).\nThe delivery occurred without complications, during which continuous electronic fetal monitoring was performed. The average fetal heart rate was higher than 110 beats/min, thus, no antiarrhythmic drugs were not used. A female baby weighing 3750 g with Apgar score 8 → 9 was born. The AV block was reversed to sinus rhythm shortly after birth, confirmed by neonatal ultrasonography and ECG which did not identify any cardiac abnormalities. The newborn was sent home within two days."
"A 25-year old male with a history of a traumatic basicervical right hip fracture evolved with an ipsilateral infected non-union, diagnosed through a CT-guided biopsy. Given the proximal femoral metaphyseal osseous defect, in the context of bone chronic infection, a two-stage revision THR was planned (). Forty-five days after reimplantation with a cementless acetabular cup and a distally fixed uncemented femoral stem (ZMRTM Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana, USA), the patient was received at the institution’s emergency service due to diffuse intolerable pain on the ipsilateral lower extremity, starting from the knee down to the metatarsophalangeal joints. Pain was not responsive to intravenous painkillers. Subcutaneous swelling was remarkable as well as skin colour changes with disappearance of the skin’s wrinkles all along the right foot and ankle. Normal laboratory parameters and a closed wound suggested absence of reinfection.\nRadiographs revealed diffuse, stippled osteoporotic changes in the right knee () and foot and ankle. Accordingly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right lower extremity showed intraosseous oedema in the distal femoral lateral epicondyle, proximal tibial metaphysis, talus, calcaneus, tarsal bones and metatarsophalangeal joints (). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry correlated that oedema with lesser focal mineral density and bone scanning indicated hyperperfusion on the mentioned areas.\nThe Pain Management Team advised medical treatment with bisphosphonates (alendronate 7.5 mg intravenously daily for three days) and 10 mg of oxycodone once a day; pregabalin 75 mg every 12 h and 80 mg of 1,2-dehydrocortisol once daily for seven days. The patient was pain-free at four months postoperatively, walking without aids. At four years follow-up, mHHS score was 88, without signs of loosening or reinfection."
"A 25-year-old man and his 26-year-old wife were referred to our reproductive medical center due to two spontaneous abortions in the past 3 years after their marriage. The abortions occurred at the sixth and seventh week of gestation for the first and second time, respectively.\nThe physical examination of the husband showed that his eyes had refractive errors; his left eye displayed congenital amblyopia and his vision was 0.2 (Fig. ). He also had bilateral primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and the intraocular pressure of his eyes was more than 40 mmHg. His eyes were subjected to a trabeculotomy and the intraocular pressure was well-controlled. He also had exomphalos (Fig. ). His two central incisors were congenitally lost as implant, his lower right primary canine was retained (Fig. ) and his lower left permanent canine was congenitally missing (Fig. ). He had graduated from high school and is now employed. He can communicate normally. His routine semen analysis demonstrated a sperm deformity rate of 99%, sperm viability rate of 9.56%, DNA fragmentation index (DFI) of 13.58%, and high DNA stainability (HDS) of 15.36%.\nHe is the second child of non-consanguineous parents and has two sisters. His parents and both sisters are healthy. After discovering his chromosome abnormalities, his family members underwent genetic testing (except his older sister, who was abroad).\nAfter genetic counseling, the couple insisted on preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Initially, they obtained two embryos to undergo PGD; both were unbalanced. After counseling, they decided to accept artificial insemination with donor spermatozoa."
"A 25-year-old African American female with an unknown past medical history was found unresponsive in her apartment. The patient was found to be severely hypoglycemic and was intubated for airway protection. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with a primary diagnosis of acute encephalopathy due to metabolic and/or septic etiology. On examination, she had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 6T/15 with preserved brainstem reflexes and no lateralizing signs. An initial CT scan of her head appeared to be normal. A repeat CT scan of her head was performed in response to minimal improvement in the patient's neurological status. This revealed diffuse sulcal effacement and obliterated basal cisterns suggestive of SAH (). Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 29 cm and closing pressure of 25 cm. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed the following: leucocytes 13/mm3 with a lymphocytic predominance, erythrocytes 10/mm3 without xanthochromia, normal protein and glucose, and negative Gram stain. Cerebral angiography was not performed. Lumbar puncture results were inconsistent with a diagnosis of SAH; thus, a diagnosis of SAH was rejected. Over the course of the hospital stay, there was a slight improvement in the patient's mental status to GCS of 8T/15. She subsequently had tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement and was transferred to a long-term acute care hospital."
"A 25-year-old black African woman, gravida 1 para 1, presented on the 15 May 2015 for difficult micturition that occurred 2 days earlier, followed by urinary retention. She had a term vaginal delivery 5 weeks earlier of a baby girl who weighed 3000 g. She had known intramural uterine fibroids confirmed by ultrasound scan 3 years earlier. On physical examination, her lower abdomen was distended. On speculum and digital vaginal examinations, a foul-smelling mass of approximately 10 cm in diameter was present in her vagina. The diagnosis of urinary retention due to a superinfected prolapsed pedunculated uterine fibroid was made. An indwelling plastic urinary catheter was easily placed. Antibiotic therapy was then started intravenously with ceftriaxone (1 g twice daily) and metronidazole (500 mg thrice daily). Two days later, under general anesthesia, the almost necrotic fibroid was held with two big toothed forceps and easily twisted off per vaginal route, without any significant bleeding. A speculum examination found a normal cervix, which was 4 cm dilated and the base of the fibroid’s pedicle was located in the posterior uterine wall at 3 cm from the external cervical os. The fibroid was sent for pathology, which later confirmed uterine leiomyoma. Antibiotics were continued for another 6 days. The catheter was removed 4 days after its placement, but 3 days after the removal of the catheter (around 9 days after prolapse of the fibroid or 5 days after fibroid removal) our patient started complaining of urine coming partly from her urethral meatus and partly from her vagina during micturition. Under general anesthesia, an urethrovaginal fistula of 3 mm diameter located 3 cm from the urethral meatus was diagnosed using the blue dye test. The fistula was successfully closed in two layers (urethral wall and vaginal wall) with polyglactin. A new catheter was placed and kept for 14 days. Her postoperative period was uneventful and she was discharged on day 15."
"A 25 year old male, with polytraumatic lesions, in coma after car crash, is intubated and mechanically ventilated for 4 days in other hospital unit. The lesions found were: acute closed cranio-cerebral trauma, thoracic trauma with multiple rib fractures and left haemopneumothorax, right femur fracture. Even if a chest tube was placed (in the left hemithorax) that evacuated about 1 liter of incoagulable blood, the lung would not expand. 30 days after trauma, the patient was conscious and still presented pain in the left hemithorax, radiological evident hydropneumothorax () and medium effort dyspnoea. The CT scan suspected a left main bronchus fracture and also revealed a total left pulmonary atelectasis (). The patient was brought by transfer to our clinic. Bronchoscopic exam showed a complete left main bronchial stenosis beginning with the third cartilage (). The normal clinical status of the patient allowed us to perform a main bronchial sleeve resection and pulmonary decortication. The lung that expanded normally at the end of the procedure was preserved. We mentioned that atelectasis lasted for 3 months before January 2006, the date of surgical procedure. The postoperative evolution was favorable and the bronchoscopic exam indicated a normal permeability and diameter of the anastomosis (, )."
"A 25-year-old man presented with pain and redness OD one week following chisel-and-hammer injury. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures (IOP) were within normal limits OU. Anterior segment examination OD showed a full-thickness self-sealed corneal tear with an underlying iris hole and focal cataract. Fundus examination revealed a single, round, elevated, jet black lesion nasal to the fovea (mimicking a foreign body) on the surface of the retina (Figure 1a ). In addition, there was an intraocular foreign body (IOFB) in the vitreous cavity (inferonasal quadrant) obscured by surrounding exudates (Figure 2a ). B scan ultrasonography and X-ray confirmed the presence of this IOFB and ruled out a second IOFB. Examination of OS was unremarkable. EDI-OCT was performed (Spectralis HRA + OCT; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany): The macula was scanned with 19 parallel horizontal 9-mm raster lines within a 5x20 degree rectangle centered on the fovea, each line being composed of 100 averaged scans. The parafoveal lesion was evaluated for thickness, configuration, and effects on retinal and choroidal tissue. Choroidal thickness by EDI-OCT was measured manually at four sites, just adjacent to the tumor edge in the superior, nasal, inferior and temporal directions on raster lines passing through the lesion; these readings were averaged to obtain the mean choroidal thickness around the hamartoma. EDI-OCT revealed an irregular, elevated, hyperreflective lesion with complete optical shadowing of the underlying retina as well as choroid; the mean choroidal thickness was within normal limits (304 µm) around the hamartoma [] (Figure 1b ). Fundus autofluorescence was obtained using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retinal Angiograph 2, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a barrier filter of 500 nm. A series of 50–90 images was averaged to obtain a high-quality picture. FAF imaging showed pronounced and discrete hypoautofluorescence of the lesion, with normofluorescent surrounding retina (Figure 1c ). Pars plana vitrectomy with foreign body removal was performed OD (Figure 2b ). On his last follow-up visit at three months, his BCVA was maintained at 20/30 with attached retina. The fundi of the parents and other siblings were examined and found to be unremarkable."
"A 25-year-old previously healthy male patient, presented with a five-month history of abdominal pain and slowly enlarged, palpable, non-tender upper abdominal mass. Physical examination of the patient disclosed a firm abdominal mass. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a well-defined heterogeneous mass involving the pancreatic tail with peripheral calcifications (). Laboratory examinations demonstrated normal levels of pancreatic enzymes and normal liver function test results. The serum tumour markers were not performed. The patient underwent distal splenopancreatectomy. Macroscopically, the pancreatic tumour was encapsulated measuring 14 x 7 cm. On cut section, it showed mainly solid and partially cystic components and demonstrated focal haemorrhage and central necrosis (). Histologically, the tumour was circumscribed by a thick fibrous capsule (). The growth pattern of the tumour was heterogeneous with a combination of soild, pseudopapillary and haemorrhagic-necrotic pseudocystic structures. The solid areas were composed of poorly cohesive monomorphic cells that were admixed with hyalinized stromal bands containing thin-walled blood vessels surrounded by loosely cohesive tumour cells radiating around blood vessels reminiscent of pseudorosettes in ependymoma (). Cholesterol clefts as well as clusters of foamy histiocytes were focally noted. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells showed positive immunostaining with CD56, CD10, β-catenin, progesterone receptor and synaptophysin focally. They were negative for chromogranin and cytokeratin. The final pathological diagnosis was SPT. No adjuvant therapy was administered. On postoperative day 8, the patient developed abscess of the abdominal wall and peritoneal collection."
"A 25-year-old male with a known diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), with preserved renal function, presented with sudden onset severe left flank, following a rugby game. The loin pain was associated with frank haematuria. On examination, he had severe tenderness to his left hypochondrium and renal angle. He was tachycardic and blood pressure was elevated at an average of 160/90 from a baseline of 130/80. A CT abdomen (Figures , , and ) revealed a large left sided haemorrhage surrounding the polycystic kidney which extended into the retroperitoneum. The renal lengths and volumes were 15.7 cm and 571 mL, respectively, on the right and 16.0 cm and 732 mL, respectively, on the left. He was managed supportively with intravenous fluids (0.9% sodium chloride solution, 125 mLs/h), analgesia (including paracetamol and codeine), and haemodynamic monitoring. Twelve hours after presentation his haemoglobin dropped from 132 g/L to 60 g/L with an associated fall in haematocrit, but with maintenance of blood pressure. This was treated with a blood transfusion (3 units packed red cells) and radiological embolization of the bleeding source (Figures , , and ). Renal function remained stable and the patient improved without the need for further intervention. He was advised to avoid contact sports in future and his haematuria and pain resolved within two weeks."
"The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of mild asthma who presented to the emergency department (ED), with a one-day history of acute onset abdominal pain on the right side of his abdomen. The severity of abdominal pain had increased over time and was associated with nausea, vomiting, and fever. His past surgical history was notable for tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis. He denied a history of smoking. He last used his albuterol inhaler over eight years ago.\nThe initial physical examination revealed high body temperature of 40 °C, sinus tachycardia of 115 bpm, and systolic blood pressures ranging between 120 to 130 mmHg. He had diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count (17.1 K/uL), hemoglobin (15.5 g/dL), platelet count (218 K/uL), blood urea nitrogen (9 mg/dL), and creatinine (1.3 mg/dL). Computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated perforated appendicitis with proximal obstructing fecalith (Figure ).\nThe patient was resuscitated with crystalloids, started on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and then taken to the operating room for an appendectomy. Intraoperative findings included fecal spillage from appendiceal tip, purulent ascites, and the indurated omentum adherent to appendix. Standard laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. The duration of the operation was one hour with an estimated blood loss of 5 mL. The patient received 3500 mL of crystalloid intraoperatively, in addition to 2000 mL of crystalloid administered in the ED. At the end of the operation, the patient was extubated, and transferred to the floor.\nOn postoperative day two, patient developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with the arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) ratio less than 100 mmHg. Chest radiography obtained revealed bilateral hilar opacity (Figure ). There was no evidence of heart failure. He was managed on the ventilator with low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) lung protective setting, following the acute respiratory distress syndrome network (ARDSNet) protocol. He was extubated on postoperative day six and discharged home on postoperative day eight.\nPathology of the appendix revealed a 6.2 cm x 1.1 cm appendix with attached mesoappendix. The cross-section of the distal tip was perforated and necrotic, with proximal obstruction by a fecalith."
"A 25-year-old female with uncomplicated ventricular septal defect presented to our casualty medical ward with the complaint of intermittent low-grade fever of 3-month duration. She had generalized malaise, loss of appetite, and weight loss over the same period. There was no history suggestive of chronic respiratory illnesses, tuberculosis, or connective tissue disorders. She was diagnosed to have small ventricular septal defect (VSD) since childhood and was on regular echocardiographic evaluation. She did not have history or peripheral evidence of intravenous drug abuse. On examination, she was thin built, pale, and febrile. There was no lymphadenopathy or features of autoimmune connective tissue disorders. She did not have finger clubbing. Her pulse rate was 90 beats per minute and blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg. There was no cardiomegaly. She had a left parasternal thrill and a harsh pan systolic murmur over the left lower sternal edge. There were no features of heart failure. Other systems' examination was unremarkable.\nHer investigations revealed white blood cell count 14 × 103/µl, neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 18%, hemoglobin 8.8 g/dl, platelets 224 × 103/µl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 40 mm in 1st hour, C-reactive protein (CRP) 75 mg/l, alanine transaminase (ALT) 26 IU/l, and aspartate transaminase (AST) 30 IU/l. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were negative. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiograph was normal. The 2D echocardiogram (2DE) revealed a perimembranous VSD, left to right shunt with a maximum pressure gradient of 105 mmHg. There was moderate tricuspid regurgitation with a maximum tricuspid pressure gradient of 36 mmHg. There was 7 mm × 4 mm-sized vegetation attached to the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The pulmonary valve was free of vegetations. There was moderate pulmonary hypertension. Her transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) confirmed the tricuspid valve vegetation (Figures and ). There were no abnormalities seen in other cardiac valves. Her blood culture was positive for Streptococcus bovis in two samples. She was diagnosed to have infective endocarditis based on fulfilling modified Duke's criteria and empirically started on intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin. Subsequent culture confirmed that the organism was sensitive to empirical antibiotics, hence continued. She also underwent detailed colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and both were normal. Her ultrasound scan of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormality. She was given intravenous gentamicin for 2 weeks and ceftriaxone for 6 weeks and made an uneventful recovery. The patient was referred to the cardiology department for further assessment for closure of VSD."
"A 25-year-old African-American female presented to our clinic with asymptomatic lesions linearly arranged over her left upper extremity. The initial lesion first appeared fifteen years ago and new lesions gradually appeared over time. She denied joint pain and/or a history of infections prior to lesion development. Her past medical history was significant only for posttraumatic distress disorder and depression. There was no personal or family history of psoriasis or other dermatologic disease. Prior to presentation in our clinic, she had a skin biopsy of the right forearm which showed chronic spongiotic dermatitis with parakeratotic foci and superficial perivascular mononuclear infiltrates. No deep dermal or periadnexal infiltrates were seen and periodic acid-Schiff staining was negative for fungal organisms. Based on the results, both lichen striatus and linear psoriasis were considered as potential diagnosis, and she was started on high-potency topical steroids. A month later, the patient was referred to our clinic when she failed to respond to treatment.\nPhysical examination revealed hyperkeratotic and scaly gray papules coalescing into a linear plaque of the right dorsal fifth finger extending medially to the right elbow (). Of note, scaly papules were also present on a tattoo above the right elbow (). There was no nail or palmoplantar involvement. The differential diagnosis included linear psoriasis and ILVEN. The isomorphic reaction seen within the patient's tattoo (Koebner phenomenon) favored a diagnosis of psoriasis. A skin biopsy and electrodessication of one papule on her right dorsal fifth finger were performed. Histological examination of the specimen revealed parakeratosis with uniformly acanthotic epidermis (). At a follow-up visit 2 weeks later, the patient developed new papules with similar morphology in the area that was previously electrodessicated (). This new episode of Koebnerization and histological findings further supported our diagnosis of linear psoriasis and the decision was made to initiate treatment with ixekizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin- (IL-) 17A. Four months later and after 8 doses of ixekizumab, we observed almost-complete resolution of the cutaneous lesions (Figures and )."
"A heterosexual man in his 20s from Denmark presented at a general practitioner clinic in Copenhagen, Denmark in January, 2017 with urethritis symptoms that he had had for two days. He had had three unprotected sexual relations with women (of Danish, Chinese and Australian nationality) during the previous 6 months and he had not travelled abroad during that time. He was empirically treated unsuccessfully with a single oral dose of azithromycin 1 g because non-gonococcal urethritis was suspected. A nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) (Aptima Combo 2, Hologic Inc.) of urine sampled at the visit to the general practitioner clinic, was positive for N. gonorrhoeae and the patient was referred 6 days later to the sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic with urethritis symptoms without purulent discharge. Culture from a urethral swab (eight days after symptom onset) was positive for N. gonorrhoeae, while NAAT and culture of pharyngeal and rectal samples were negative. He was successfully treated with single doses of ceftriaxone 0.5 g intramuscularly and azithromycin 2 g orally and advised to abstain from sexual contacts until test-of-cure (TOC) as outlined in the Danish treatment recommendation []. Two weeks after treatment, the TOC using NAAT of urethral and pharyngeal samples were negative and all symptoms were resolved. The patient had no sexual contacts between onset of symptoms and TOC. The Danish sexual contact was NAAT-negative and the two other women were lost to follow-up."
"A 25-year-old, previously healthy male, presented to a peripheral hospital with acute ascending paralysis. There was no history of diarrhea or respiratory infection. He was transferred to our hospital the following day for a neurological consultation and investigation. On arrival, he had dyspnea with the involvement of respiratory muscles. A diagnosis of acute Guillain-Barre syndrome was made, and the patient was placed on a ventilator.The nursing staff applied compression stockings to his lower limbs upon arrival. Removal of the stockings on day 3 of admission revealed linear PUs on the lateral aspect of both little toes and medial aspect of the left and right big toes as seen in Figures -. The ulcers were categorized as Grade II on the National Pressure Ulcer advisory panel scoring system [].\nUpon inquiry, it was revealed by the attendants (family caretaker) that the staff at the previous hospital had applied compression stockings and that they had not been removed nor pressure areas inspected for possible skin break down. Our staff then removed the compression stockings. The nursing staff was advised regarding the need for regular inspection of pressure areas, and the attendants (caretaker and nursing attendant) participated in the pressure ulcer prevention program. The patient’s PUs healed satisfactorily without any intervention."
"A 25-year-old male sustained a severe traumatic brain injury and fracture of the shaft of the left femur in a traffic accident. He was transferred to our hospital for orthopedic and neurosurgical consultations following initial treatment at a peripheral hospital. He was placed on ventilator support, and a tracheostomy was performed. He was successfully weaned off the ventilator after 13 days. On his arrival at the intensive care unit, compression stockings were applied to both legs below the knee as mechanical thromboprophylaxis. We noticed a linear, Grade II PU on the medial aspect of the right big toe and three Grade I PUs on the anterior aspect of the left ankle as shown in Figures -.\nIt was established that prolonged application of the compression stockings caused the ulcers and that no assessment of the feet for possible PU had occurred. Another Grade II PU on the right heel was found, though it was not caused by the application of compression stockings but by poor positioning. All PUs healed without any intervention."
"The second patient was a 25-year-old male, the younger brother of the first patient. He presented for an EP study with possible pacemaker placement. The patient reported generalized weakness and poorer functional status than his sister, necessitating the use of assistance to ambulate. However, in contrast with his sister, this patient denied a history of sleep apnea or the use of a CPAP machine (polysomnogram was reportedly negative). He also denied any history of GERD. This patient had a similar anesthetic plan prescribed, using MAC anesthesia for an EP study and converting to GA if a pacemaker needed to be placed. For sedation, the patient received a total of 100 mcg of Fentanyl IV (in 50 mcg boluses) and 2 mg of Midazolam IV (in 1 mg boluses). He required minimal sedation for the study and was comfortable throughout. His EP study did not reveal any ECG abnormalities (PR interval 200 ms, QRS 110 ms), and there was no need for pacemaker insertion at the time. The patient emerged from sedation without incident and recovered in the post-anesthesia care unit without evidence of respiratory compromise. He was discharged home the same day with recommendations for serial ECGs every 6–12 months."
"A 25 year-old female was referred to the Gynecology\nClinic of Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital because of chronic\nabdominal pain, myomatous uterus and a 6×8 cm2 right\nadnexal mass suspicious to be a dermoid cyst in sonography\nand magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports due\nto the presence of dense calcification in the tumor. Tumor\nmarkers were all normal. She had been born by uncomplicated\nnormal vaginal delivery. She spoke and walked\nat 19 months of age and her neurodevelopment was normal.\nAt 21 years of age, she was diagnosed with OKCs in\nthe mandibular and maxillary regions, and submitted to\nsurgery for the removal of her dental cysts. In less than\na year, the surgery was repeated due to recurrent OKCs.\nOne year later, she complained of pain in her lower abdomen\nand underwent trans-abdominal ultrasonography\nand pelvic MRI, which revealed the right ovarian mass,\nsuspicious of being a dermoid cyst, and a myomatosis\nseptated uterus. Physical examination revealed hirsutism\nwith harsh face and multiple nevi on face and upper trunk.\nShe underwent laparoscopic surgery but after abdominal\nentry, we encountered unusual round solid ovarian masses,\nwhich could not be excluded as malignant. Frozen sections,\nhowever, showed they were benign. There was a 6\ncm endometrioma in the right ovary and multiple bilateral\novarian fibromas (Figes, ). There were also endometriotic\npatches in a posterior cul-de-sac. We excised 7\nfibromas from the left ovary and 5 fibromas from the right\novary in different sizes ranging from 0.3 to 5 cm in diameter.\nBoth ovaries were preserved. The definitive histologic\ndiagnosis confirmed stromal proliferation and no atypia in\nthe ovarian tissue with areas of necrosis, corresponding to\nan ovarian fibroma and endometriosis.\nAccording to the laparoscopy outcome, pathologic findings\nand history of recurrent OKCs, Gorlin syndrome was\nthe top differential diagnosis. Investigation for other signs\nand symptoms of this syndrome confirmed the diagnosis.\nChest radiography, posterior-anterior skull view and spine x-\nrays were normal. We referred the patient to a dermatologist\nand excisional biopsy of nevi was undertaken. Fortunately,\nthe pathologic examination was benign. A written consent\nwas taken from the patient for publication of this report."
"Patient 3: A 25 year-old female from Tay Ninh province on the border of Cambodia northwest of Ho Chi Minh City presented in February 2015 with one month of fever, fatigue, cervical lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions. She was diagnosed with HIV and T. marneffei infection based on positive skin microcopy and culture. At presentation the CD4+ T-cell count was 02 cells/µL. She was treated with itraconazole 400 mg/day with resolution of fever and skin lesions and was discharged on D+14. She began first-line ART on D+37. She was doing well and gaining weight until month 5 on ART when she developed high fever, new purulent skin lesions on her face and legs, and bilateral interphalangeal joint swelling and pain (). She had a large lesion resembling erythema nodosum on the extensor surface of the right elbow (). Her hematology and biochemistry results were in normal ranges, and her CD4 T-cell was 96 cells/µL on D+167. Abdominal ultrasound performed for abdominal pain revealed new intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Chest X-ray was normal. Skin culture was positive for both T. marneffei and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Hemoculture was negative. She was treated with intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate and intravenous oxacillin for MSSA super-infection of the skin lesions, both for 2 weeks plus one week of ibuprofen for joint pain. Her fever and skin lesions resolved after 10 days; however she developed productive cough and cervical lymph node enlargement during hospitalization. FNA of the lymph node showed no organism; however her sputum AFB smear was positive and she was started on antituberculosis therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. She was discharged after 19 days of hospitalization on antituberculosis therapy, and the dose of itraconazole was increased to the maximum dose of 600 mg/day for further 10 weeks to account for the rifampicin-induced reduction in itraconazole levels, as therapeutic monitoring for itraconazole was not available in Vietnam. The patient had a gradual improvement of symptoms over 3 months. At the last follow up visit in June 2016, she was completely well, and the CD4 T-cell count had increased to 170 cells/µL."
"A previously healthy male patient in his 20s was diagnosed with smear-positive, culture-confirmed pulmonary TB and TB pleurisy. No cholelithiasis was noted in abdominal sonographs obtained 2 years prior to the diagnosis of TB. The standard four-drug anti-TB treatment improved his TB clinical symptoms, including fever, chest pain, and left pleural effusion; however, abnormal liver function was noted (AST: 303 IU/L; ALT: 499 IU/L; and total bilirubin: 0.56 mg/dL) after 6 weeks of treatment, which resolved (ASL: 26 IU/L; ALT: 34 IU/L; total bilirubin: 0.1 mg/dL) after the interruption of anti-TB treatment. In the 18th week, anti-TB treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol was resumed. However, the patient experienced acute abdominal cramping pain in the following week. His aminotransferase and bilirubin level did not increase (AST: 22 IU/L; ALT: 17 IU/L; and total bilirubin: 0.57 mg/dL). Multiple small cholelithiases were discovered using abdominal sonography. Rechallenge with anti-TB treatment was complicated by recurrent abdominal cramping pain immediately after taking the anti-TB drugs. Because gastroenterologists suggested a possible diagnosis of intermittent biliary obstruction due to a passing stone, he received conservative management. The anti-TB treatment was successfully completed in the ninth month after TB diagnosis.\nThe demographic characteristics and clinical course of these four patients are summarized in Table ."
"A 25-year-old man with a height of 168 cm and weight of 68 kg underwent arthroscopic surgery to treat a rotator cuff tear caused by recurrent shoulder dislocation. He had no remarkable medical history. General anesthesia was induced with propofol (100 mg), remifentanil (0.3 μg/kg/min), and rocuronium (40 mg), while an 8.0-mm endotracheal tube was inserted for airway management. Additionally, a brachial plexus block was administered with 0.25% levobupivacaine (30 mL) through an interscalene approach under ultrasonographic guidance, and an indwelling catheter was placed. While the patient was placed in the beach-chair position during surgery, anesthesia was maintained with oxygen 1 L/min, air 2 L/min, 1.5% sevoflurane, and remifentanil 0.2-0.3 μg/kg/min. The patient was monitored using five-lead electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and capnometry. The total dose of rocuronium administered was 90 mg, and the last dose of 10 mg was given 15 min before the end of the surgery. The operative time was 3 h and 21 min. Continuous infusion of remifentanil was discontinued simultaneous with the end of surgery. Administration of sevoflurane was discontinued 5 min later. Sugammadex was intravenously administered at 100 mg to reverse rocuronium. Since the patient regained clear consciousness and spontaneous breathing at 10 mL/kg, the intubation tube was removed. Immediately after extubation, he presented with retractive breathing and stridor. According to the capnometer readings, the end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) concentration was undetectable. Although 100% oxygen was administered at 10 L/min via a facemask, oxygen saturation (SpO2) decreased to approximately 70%. Onset of laryngospasm was suspected, and thus, 100% oxygen was started at 10 L/min with continuous positive airway pressure (30 cm H2O). The patient’s airway was reopened after a while. Consequently, both stridor and retractive breathing resolved. The EtCO2 waveforms became detectable with a capnometer, and SpO2 also improved to 100% (Fig.). The patient was monitored in the operating room for 30 min. After a stable level of consciousness and stable respiratory patterns were confirmed, he was discharged from the operating room. No recurrence of laryngospasm was observed throughout the postoperative course."
"Case 2 was a 25-year-old male patient. At presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 1 in both eyes. With the Goldman applanation tonometer, the intraocular pressure was measured as 20 mmHg in the right eye and respectively 21 mmHg in the left eye. The central corneal thickness was 575 microns in the right eye and 579 microns in the left eye. Ocular response analyzer revealed IOPcc 20,1 mmHg, IOPg 20,4 mmHg, CH 10,8, CRF 10,3 in the RE and IOPcc 21,4 mmHg, IOPg 21,7 mmHg, CH 10,6, CRF 10,2 in LE. Gonioscopy showed an open angle in both eyes. As for the fundus exam, the cup disc ratio was symmetrical and was appreciated as 0,6-0,7.\nWe performed an optical coherence tomography () that revealed a severe loss of nerve fibers in the nasal quadrant and a moderate nerve fiber loss in the inferior quadrant for the right eye and a moderate nerve fiber loss in the nasal quadrant in the left eye. We continued by assessing the ganglion cell complex, which showed no reduction or thinning ().\nThis time we also noticed the fact that the two investigations were out of line with each other, so we carefully adjusted the margins of the optic disc according to the patients’ myopic changes and performed another OCT that did not show any loss of nerve fibers ()."
"A 25-year-old female attempted suicide and fell from approximately 7 meters. The following injuries were diagnosed in the primary survey: fractures of the first and second lumbar vertebrae, incomplete paraplegia below L2, a type III open fracture of the right lower extremity, a fracture of the left calcaneus and a pancreatic contusion. These injuries resulted in an ISS of 26. Pancreas contusion was detected in the primary survey trauma scan. Within the first three days of hospitalization, the patient developed an acute abdomen due to peritonitis. Urgent laparotomy, lavage and abdominal drain placement were conducted. Intraoperatively, the head of the pancreas was considerably rotated, causing significant bleeding, and the lesser sac was filled with small vessel bleeding. Macroscopic rupture was not present. The injury was classified using the AAST-OIS as a grade IV laceration. Postoperatively, CT findings showed indistinguishable pancreatic tissue. Recurrent clinical deterioration occurred with symptoms including abdominal pain and increased inflammatory markers (). The infection was treated successfully with eight weeks of antibiotic therapy and consistent flushing of the drain. The patient was discharged from the hospital with paraplegia after 3 months of rehabilitation for her spinal cord injury."
"A 25-years-old woman with an autoimmune hypothyroidism since 2 years, treated with levothyroxine 200 mcg daily, was admitted with fever (37.9 oC). She had neck pain and a rapidly growing goiter, mainly affecting the left lobe. Inflammatory parameters were elevated (ESR 140 mm/h, CRP 119 mg/L, normal <20 and <5, respectively). Based on this clinical presentation together with an initial FNA that had showed a purulent material with granulocytes and fibrin, acute thyroiditis was suspected and antibiotics were initiated. Two days later the diagnosis was reevaluated to subacute thyroiditis because of the clinical appearance and a new FNA showing a mixture of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes. Prednisolone 40 mg once daily was initiated, and the dose were tapered to 7.5 mg/day, as the volume of the goiter decreased with clinical improvement. After 1 month a clinical deterioration was noted. A third FNA was performed from the right lobe showing granulocytes, eosinophils, and a large number of partially destroyed muscle cells that was judged to be a late phase of a subacute thyroiditis, and the prednisolone dose was increased to 30 mg/day. During the next 4 years, the patient went through different periods of activation of the disease, which responded, well but transitory to glucocorticoid therapy. The FNAs showed every time an inflammatory process with a mixture of granulocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells and fibroblasts and fragments of muscle cells. A biopsy of a lymph node from the neck showed reactive changes with an increase of plasma cells.\nAfter 4 years of evolution total thyroidectomy including extirpation of some lymph nodes was performed, and RT with extension outside the thyroid gland was the final pathological diagnosis.\nEight years after surgery, and 12 years after initial presentation, the patient still had exacerbations of the general and local symptoms that always were treated with prednisolone for different periods of time. Finally a biopsy was taken from the right maxillary sinus secondarily to symptoms related to the sinus. The pathological diagnosis was IgG4 sclerosing disease. No serum increase of IgG4 was ever detected. Azathioprine was initiated but was stopped secondary to an increase of the liver enzymes. During the following 10 years she was treated with mycophenolate mofetil combined with Rituximab because of lack of effect of mycophenolate mofetil alone, and at last follow-up 22 years after the initial presentation she still has periods of inflammation."
"A 25-year-old male with history of schizophrenia, prior suicide attempt, and hallucinogen abuse presented to the emergency department (ED) under mental health arrest for altered mental status. Neighbors notified police after he had broken several windows in his home and was creating loud noise and disturbance. They arrived to find him in front of the house and fighting with a cat; he was bleeding from lacerations on his chest caused by the cat's claws. The patient was subdued with a conducted electrical weapon and restrained in the field for aggressive behavior. In the ED, the patient endorsed suicidal ideation and was reportedly amnestic to the events prior to hospitalization. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 116/71 mm Hg and his pulse was 88 beats per minute. Multiple abrasions were noted on his chest, feet, and hands in addition to a laceration on his forehead, which required sutures. He had mild clonus with 3+ patellar reflexes but was not overtly rigid. His pupils were dilated and he had flushed skin but no diaphoresis. The initial laboratory values were significant for creatine kinase (CK) of 895 IU/L, white blood cell count of 20 k/mm3, and urine immunoassay positive for amphetamines (confirmation negative; cocaine, benzodiazepines, tetrahydrocannabinol, and opiates also negative). A medical toxicology consult was requested and the patient admitted to drinking a hallucinogenic tea purchased from the Internet containing ayahuasca. He reported taking no prescription or over-the-counter medications. He was admitted for medical observation and given intravenous fluids. Over the course of the first hospital day his mental status returned to baseline. The CK peaked at 1499 IU/L after 36 hours. A reference lab analysis later showed greater than 2,000 ng/mL dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in his urine. The patient was medically cleared after a 24-hour observation period and then admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit for suicidal statements before eventually being discharged home on hospital day four with primary care provider follow-up."
"A 25-year-old male biologist from Japan visited a rainforest in Malaysia in 2009 to collect spiders for study. He developed abdominal pain and diarrhea during the third week. The symptoms did not improve, and he returned to Japan after the fourth week. Because of intermittent abdominal pain and watery diarrhea, the patient visited Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, where hookworm eggs were detected in a feces sample prepared by formalin-ethyl ether sedimentation (Fig. a) along with an increased number of peripheral eosinophils (3.0 × 103/μL), while neither pathogenic protozoa nor bacteria were identified in fecal samples or culture. Filariform larvae of hookworms were found in a Harada-Mori culture (Fig. b). Eleven adult worms, five males and six females, were expelled after treatment with a single dose (10 mg/kg) of pyrantel pamoate and identified as A. ceylanicum based on morphological characteristics [, ], such as one set of prominent outer and one set of much smaller inner teeth on a cutting plate in the mouthpart (Fig. c) and parallel mediolateral and posterior-lateral rays of the copulatory bursa in the males (Fig. d). Later, DNA was extracted from one of the adult worms and preserved in ethanol solution using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) and subjected to a PCR assay specific for the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene. The primer sets used are shown in Additional file : Table S1. The cox1 region was analyzed using an ABI Prism 3100-Avant Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and shown to have the A. ceylanicum sequence (GenBank: accession no. LC271155.1)."
"A 25-year-old male patient with obvious dentofacial deformity due to an underlying unilateral right hemimandibular hyperplasia (a–d). Preoperatively an increased tracer uptake in the scintigraphy demonstrates an “active condyle,” which is likely responsible for persistent mandibular growth (e). The initial surgical intervention consisted of a high condylectomy in combination with the insertion of a transpalatal distraction device in order to correct the transverse maxillary deficiency and prevent further mandibular growth (f,g). After the orthodontic closure of the diastema (h) and levelling of the dental arches, surgical correction was subsequently performed by “two-jaw surgery”: the maxillary advancement after LeFort I osteotomy and mandibular setback after a bisagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) resulted in a clockwise rotation of the occlusal plane and improved jaw relations (i). Clinical situation after material removal and with ongoing orthodontic treatment (j–l)."
"A 25-year-old gravida 3, para 2002 at 32 0/7 weeks' gestation was referred with a 24-hour history of intermittent severe abdominal pain and obstipation. Her past medical history was significant for hypothyroidism, a microcytic anemia, and sigmoid volvulus in her previous pregnancy two years prior requiring endoscopic reduction at 26 weeks' gestation. Physical examination revealed suprapubic and right lower quadrant tenderness, with normal bowel sounds on auscultation; peritoneal signs of rebound and/or guarding were absent. Obstetric ultrasound demonstrated a nonanomalous singleton fetus with biometry consistent with gestational age, no evidence of placental abruption, and normal cervix length. Due to gravid status, abdominal radiography was inconclusive but suggestive of colonic distention. Laboratory evaluation was remarkable for normal leukocyte count and lactate, amylase, and hepatic transaminase levels. Two tap water enemas were efficacious in prompting adequate stool output with alleviation of clinical symptoms, and she was discharged.\nSubsequently, she returned at 32 4/7 weeks with similar complaints; the gastroenterology service was consulted, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a 90-degree twist of the colon 30 cm from the anal verge (). Colonoscopic decompression followed by rectal tube placement for 24 hours was successful, and she was discharged home. Unfortunately, symptoms recurred at 37 0/7 weeks, and she underwent a second colonoscopy with decompression, with rectal tube left in place. At 38 1/7 weeks, she underwent a third colonoscopic decompression procedure, and the decision was made to proceed with delivery. Labor was induced, culminating in a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a healthy female infant. Unfortunately she again experienced worsening abdominal pain on the first day postpartum, with computer tomography imaging confirming sigmoid distention with recurrence of volvulus (). A fourth colonoscopic decompression was performed, and she was discharged home on the second day postpartum. Symptoms again recurred on postpartum day 32 and were managed by a fifth colonoscopic decompression followed by uncomplicated laparoscopic sigmoidectomy on postpartum day 34. Histopathologic evaluation of the excised specimen was benign."
"A 25-year-old male serviceman sustained a crush injury of his right medius finger on the flight deck of the Charles De Gaulle aircraft carrier. He experienced oblique distal amputation through the nail bed in Ischikawa zone 1 []. An emergency replantation was decided by the onboard orthopedic surgeon who was also hand surgeon. In absence of operating microscope, the procedure was performed under ×3.5 magnification loupes with microsurgical instruments. While the anesthesiologist began locoregional anesthesia, the amputated fragment was prepared. Skin and subdermal tissue were gently debrided, the central artery was located and a 10/10 K-wire was placed using the «in-and-out» method to fix the distal phalanx. Next, the digital stump was debrided and trimmed. The proximal part of the central artery was dissected. After bony fixation, proximal and distal arterial targets were aligned and arterial repair was performed under tourniquet using interrupted stitches of 10-0 (). No vein was suitable for anastomosis and nerve repair was unnecessary because the digital nerves had already trifurcated into distal branches. Several 5-0 nylon sutures were used to loosely approximate the skin. The nail bed was repaired with 6-0 Dexon sutures. For venous outflow, a stab incision was made at the pulp tip and the nail plate was removed. The wound was covered with a nonadherent dressing, the hand was not elevated and kept warm. To prevent vascular thrombosis 160 mg of acetylsalicylic was injected intravenously during surgery, and was continued per-os for 1 month []. Prophylactic antibiotic medication by penicillin with clavulanic acid was administrated for 3 days. The following day the patient was evacuated to a hand surgical unit in France where postoperative care was performed. A blood transfusion was required due to the postoperative external bleeding necessary to maintain venous outflow. After a follow-up period of 4 months, a new nail was growing with an excellent aesthetic aspect (). Range of motion of the distal interphangeal joint was normal and bone union of the distal phalanx was acquired. Sensation recovery was incomplete with a static two-point discrimination of 7 mm."
"A 25-year-old Asian woman fell from a height of approximately 3 m, and her face contacted the floor first. On presentation to our hospital, she complained of severe neck pain, skin numbness of forearms, and weak limbs. A neurological examination showed impaired triceps brachii muscles (strength of 3+ on a 5-point scale). CT with three-dimensional reconstruction revealed an articular process fracture and unilateral facet dislocation on the right side at C6/7 (Fig. ). MR imaging showed mild cord compression. Preoperative use of a cervical collar maintained her spinal alignment. Posterior reduction with wiring of the C6/7 spinous processes was performed after removal of the facet fragments. Anterior decompression and fixation using a cage with iliac bone and a plate was then performed. A halo vest was used postoperatively for the instability of the upper cervical spine due to atlas fracture. At 3 months postoperatively, loosening of the fixators had not occurred (Fig. ), the aberrant skin sensation abated, and her muscle strength had improved. At the 6-month follow-up, consolidation of the graft bone was observed and her sensory and motor function had recovered completely."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with intermittent headache, dizziness for 5 years, and decreased left eye vision for 1 year. Defects in the left temporal retina and partial nasal visual field were observed. MRI revealed a mass measuring 3 × 22 × 22 mm in the sellar region. Microsurgical resection was performed by transnasal endoscopic excision of the PA. The tumor was soft and gray red with medium blood supply. In the pathological examination, the tumor was positive for GH and PRL (scattered). Tumor cells with particles were detected in the interstitial vascular compartment with thickening of the basement membrane (Fig. ). TEM: Large particles and circular particles were observed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. The rough endoplasmic reticulum was rich in lamellar assemblies and swelling of mitochondria was observed (Fig. )."
"The patient is a 25-year-old G1P0 initially presenting to our L&D triage with a 28 weeks and 2 days of monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation with a diagnosis of threatened preterm labor. Her antenatal history included demise of twin B occurring at 11 w 6 d and an abnormal QUAD Screen with a 1 : 6 risk of open spina bifida. The last sonographic evaluation during the pregnancy was done at an outside institution reporting a viable 20 w 5 d fetus with an EFW of 365 g and a demise twin B with measurements consistent with a 13 w 4 d gestation.\nAn ultrasound performed upon admission confirmed the dating of the pregnancy and a diagnosis of TRAP Sequence was made. The ultrasound findings were the following: twin A (pump twin), an EFW of 953 g (27th percentile) was obtained, the Ductus Venosus (DV) and Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Doppler flows values were normal, an umbilical artery (UA) Doppler S/D ratio of 5.0 (>4.25 is greater than the 95% ile), and the left sided Tei index was 0.4. There was no evidence of cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion, or polyhydramnios. We were unable to ascertain an expected weight for twin B (the acardiac twin). A management plan was made for surveillance three times weekly with Biophysical Profile (BPP), UA, MCA, DV Doppler flows, and Tei index.\nAt 29 w 2 d, the UA S/D ratio was 4.53, the MCA-PSV was 44.0 cm/second and PI was 1.7, the DV did not have an absent or an abnormal a-wave, the BPP 6/10 (−2 for breathing and −2 for minimal variability on the NST), and the left sided Tei index was 0.6 with evidence of mild cardiomegaly with mild tricuspid regurgitation. A decision for delivery was made.\nTwin A had an APGAR score of 7.8 with a neonatal weight of 1000 g. The acardiac twin had a weight of 1000 g as well (see Figures and ). The initial cord gases showed a pH of 7.14. The maternal postoperative course was unremarkable and she was discharged home on postoperative day three.\nThe pump twin's neonatal course was complicated by RDS requiring intubation with surfactant administration. Neonatal echocardiogram confirmed mild left ventricular dilation and a small PDA. The infant was discharged home in stable condition 7 weeks after delivery."
"A 25-year-old female with past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome and asthma was evaluated for one year of chronic watery diarrhea. She reported three to four watery bowel movements daily, which were associated with abdominal cramping. No blood reported in the stool. No changes in weight or appetite were reported. She denied any fever or chills. She reported that symptoms started after a course of antibiotics for an upper respiratory tract infection that occurred the previous year. She denied any recent travel or use of any herbal supplements. No medication use reported. The physical exam, including vital signs on presentation, was unremarkable. The serum chemistries, including liver enzymes, were unremarkable. Stool culture, ova, and parasites were unremarkable. Stool Clostridium difficile was also negative. Celiac disease antibodies were unremarkable. Stool occult blood test was positive. She was screened for Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases but results were negative for tissues transglutaminase, anti-endomysial, and saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. The patient underwent colonoscopy for the evaluation of chronic diarrhea and revealed multiple polyps throughout the colon with inflamed surfaces which were biopsied (Figure ).\nBiopsy from polyps revealed chronic colitis with features of lymphocytic colitis. The lamina propria shows dense plasma cells and lymphocytic infiltration mixed with eosinophils and neutrophils (Figure ).\nThe concern was for hyperplastic polyposis syndrome given the morphological appearance of diffuse polyposis seen on colonoscopy. Genetic testing for adenomatous polyposis gene was done and came back negative. The patient was started on tapering doses of budesonide with improvement in her symptoms."
"A 25-year-old male presented at our clinics for a right shoulder pain related to a dorsal scapular mass first observed 4 months earlier. The main symptom was a shoulder discomfort when lying on his back, sometimes compromising the sleep. The patient also complained of some weakness when using his right arm under the shoulder level. The medical history consisted in a unique kidney and past treatments for a nodular sclerosis-subtype Hodgkin lymphoma (chemotherapy and radiotherapy, last treatment twelve years ago and no recurrence).\nThe physical examination revealed a nonmobile 3 cm T × 3 cm AP × 2 cm CC hard mass on the posterior superomedial angle of the right scapula, sensitive to palpation (). Muscle trophicity was symmetrical. The right shoulder presented a full range of motion in all directions without scapulothoracic dyskinesis. Weakness and pain were observed when raising the right shoulder or during active abduction (at all levels).\nA right shoulder radiological series including AP, lateral, and Neer views was described normal and conducted additional investigations. A thoracic computed tomography was performed and described a 2.6 cm T × 2.6 cm AP × 2.2 cm CC solid bone mass at the posterior aspect of the superomedial angle of the scapula. The diagnosis of an osteochondroma without signs of malignancy was stated (). No adenopathy or recurrence of the past Hodgkin lymphoma was observed. Retrospectively, the mass was apparent on the shoulder Neer view. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including the right shoulder and scapula confirmed the benign character of the osteochondroma. The accessory nerve (XI) was compressed between the osteochondroma and the deep layer of the trapezius; no muscle atrophy was described ().\nThe osteochondroma was surgically removed under general anesthesia. The patient was prone, and a 10 cm incision was centered on the mass. The trapezius muscle was split at its superior part at the level of the scapula spine. The accessory nerve was visualized and protected in the deep layer of the trapezius muscle. The osteochondroma was exposed and resected from the supraspinatous fossa with an osteotome. The mass was perfectly smooth and measured 3 cm T × 3 cm AP × 2 cm CC (). The integrity of the accessory nerve was checked before closure. The histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a benign osteochondroma ().\nThe shoulder was immobilized in a sling 10 days for wound care. Free mobilization was then granted. No physiotherapy was needed.\nThe patient was followed annually up to 3 years. He regained full shoulder range of motion and complete symmetric trapezius and rotator cuff strength. The patient has no clinical and radiological recurrence of the osteochondroma."
"A man aged 25 years presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, and meaningless speech, in addition to weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite for the last 4–5 months. In the patient, who had a tendency to sleep, neck stiffness and bilateral papillary edema were detected and lumbar puncture (LP) was performed for meningoencephalitis as the preliminary diagnosis. LP revealed high CSF protein, 30 cells, and negative culture. Cranial MRI revealed triventricular hydrocephalus and leptomeningeal contrast enhancement (Figure a,b). Brucella Rose Bengal (+) and Brucella agglutination: 1/160 were detected in routine blood tests performed for the etiology. The patient was treated successfully with antibiotic therapy and was discharged to complete the treatment for 6 months. On the 12th day and on the 24th day of the onset of treatment, the patient was admitted with worsening of the clinical findings and loss of strength in the left arm and leg because the patient had stopped the treatment. A neurologic examination revealed left central facial paralysis, left upper and lower muscle strength was 4/5, and the left plantar response was extensor. In the cranial MR images of the patient, a lesion compatible with abscess was detected in the right half of the pons (picture 4c–f). The antibiotic therapy was rescheduled, and complete improvement was seen in the clinical condition of the patient. The patient was evaluated as having meningoencephalitis and pons abscess of neurobrucellosis."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of pain in the left lower leg during walking. Claudication was the main symptom. The patient had no other risk factors for atherosclerosis or Buerger’s disease. Systemic and cardiac system examinations were normal. All pulses including popliteal and distal arteries were not palpable in the neutral position of left leg. Leg swelling, and ischemic symptoms were detected. There were palpable femoral pulses. Motor and sensory functions of both lower limbs was intact. The patient refused the conventional angiography. Therefore, an MRI scan was performed, which showed the aorta and iliac arteries to be normal. There was an occluded left PA. MRI demonstrated that the PA crossed below the popliteal muscle Fig. (). We suggested an operation due to ischemia of the lower limb, but the patient declined a surgical approach. Therefore medical therapy, which included administration of antiaggregant and anticoagulant drugs, was prescribed. Six months later, this patient presented to our emergency clinic with the complaint of ischemic leg symptoms. Conventional angiography showed that there was a total occlusion of PA because of an acute thrombus. We operated in an emergent situation. The medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle was totally divided, and fibrotic bands were cut. Embolectomy was performed using a Fogarty catheter. PA blood flow was provided using a saphenous vein interposition. Dual antiplatelet treatment, clopidogrel (daily dose of 75 mgr), and acetylsalicylic acid (daily dose of 100 mgr) were prescribed after surgery. The patient was discharged to home in a good clinical condition 5 days after surgery."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service complaining of mandibular third molars with need for removal. She reported that she had sought another service, in which the extraction was indicated in a hospital, under general anesthesia, with posterior internal fixation of the mandible with plates and screws due to the risk of mandibular fracture. Panoramic radiograph revealed partially erupted third molars compatible with taurodontism extending up to the base of the mandible (). Medical history was not relevant. Computed tomography was performed to identify related anatomical structures revealing close relation to the mandibular canal in both sides. So, considering the risk of mandibular fracture and paresthesia in both sides, coronectomy was proposed to both teeth under local anesthesia. After patient's consent, intraoral approaches consisting of conventional accesses for third molars were performed. Only the crowns were removed through bur sectioning, under copious saline irrigation, at the level of cementoenamel junction, keeping the roots intact and thus avoiding dislocation and force transmission. Consequently, damage to the inferior alveolar nerve and occurrence of mandibular fracture were prevented. A diamond spherical drill was used to regularize the surface of the remaining roots. Primary closure was made with 5.0 nylon sutures and removed after 7 days. Surgery and postoperative period were uneventful, and control radiographs were done at 7 days, 3, 6, and 12 months. Roots migration occurred in both sides (). After 1-year follow-up no complications were observed with complete healing on both sides."
"In July 2013, a 25-year-old male presented to the ED with complaints of a 4-day history of fever, myalgia, bone pain, headache, malaise, chills, and nausea (). Two days earlier he had sought care at a local health center where he was found to be dehydrated and was given intravenous (IV) fluids. Upon presentation to the ED, he was afebrile, and laboratory results demonstrated thrombocytopenia and mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs) ( and ). He was given a provisional diagnosis of viral syndrome with a rule-out of dengue, given acetaminophen and IV fluids, and admitted for care.\nOn the first day of hospitalization, he remained afebrile and developed nausea, vomiting, and dry cough. His lungs were consistently clear to auscultation and chest X-rays were unremarkable. Repeat laboratory values on the third day of hospitalization demonstrated worsening thrombocytopenia. Additional laboratory results obtained the following day demonstrated leukocytosis and improving thrombocytopenia. He was discharged home on day 4 of hospitalization with a diagnosis of dengue.\nA serum specimen collected on day 5 of illness was positive by MAT with a reciprocal titer of 100 against serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae (serovar Mankarso). Serum collected upon discharge 8 days after illness onset had a reciprocal MAT titer of 3,200 against serovar Mankarso."
"Case 1. A man aged 25 years spent 6 months teaching in Ghana. For 2 months he took atovaquone-proguanil for malaria chemoprophylaxis but reportedly stopped early because he thought it was unnecessary. His symptoms began on February 27, 2015, a total of 3 days after returning to the United States, and he was hospitalized on March 1, 2015; he received a diagnosis of cerebral malaria from a P. falciparum infection with 29% parasitemia. He was treated with intravenous quinidine and doxycycline, and in the early afternoon of March 2, 2015, he experienced two cardiac arrests. After the second episode, he was nonresponsive. Artesunate was obtained from CDC; the first dose was administered at 8:30 p.m. on March 2, 2015, and the parasitemia rapidly resolved. Approximately 2 hours after administration of artesunate, electroencephalography demonstrated an absence of significant brain activity. Subsequent imaging and perfusion studies demonstrated cerebral herniation and brain death. The patient was pronounced dead on March 15, 2015."
"Case 7. In 2012, a woman aged 25 years from Ghana with a history of sickle cell disease moved to the United States. In late August 2015, she returned from visiting friends and family in Ghana, and she did not take chemoprophylaxis. Symptoms began on September 5 with a headache and fatigue. On September 7, she had yellow eyes and called her physician; however, the office was closed for Labor Day, so she sought treatment on the morning of September 8; after consultation at the primary care clinic, her health care provider called an ambulance. In the emergency department, the initial diagnosis was sickle cell crisis. Laboratory tests revealed an increased anion gap (22 mEq/L), lactic acidosis, severe hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin 4.1 g/dL and bilirubin 40 mg/dL), and the blood smear was positive for a P. falciparum infection (2% parasitemia). The spleen was not visualized with abdominal ultrasound. She was admitted and administered oral artemether-lumefantrine. Later the same day, the woman became confused and agitated and then unresponsive. She was noted to be in asystole and was resuscitated twice in the next few hours. She was treated with blood transfusions and intravenous bicarbonate, quinidine, and doxycycline. The woman became progressively more acidotic and died approximately 14 hours after arriving at the hospital."
"A 25-year-old man presented with abdominal pain, tea-colored urine, altered mental state, and seizure. He was treated with intravenous phenytoin. Two days later, he developed flaccid tetraparesis and ophthalmoplegia. MRI brain showed mildly enhancing T2 and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensities in bilateral caudate nucleus heads, periaqueductal gray matter, mammillary bodies, superior and inferior colliculi, bilateral hypoglossal and vestibular nuclei. CSF was normal. NCS showed length-dependent axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. His urine ketones were raised as he was not fed on account of the abdominal pain. He was treated with intravenous thiamine for Wernicke's encephalopathy with improvement in ophthalmoplegia and MRI brain findings. However, he continued to have flaccid weakness, hyporeflexia, autonomic dysfunction, and required mechanical ventilation. GBS overlapping with MFS was considered and he was treated with IVIg. He did not improve. He was finally diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) when the urine test was positive for porphobilinogen. All medications that can worsen AIP were withdrawn. Patient eventually improved to premorbid status. We believe the MRI changes were due to concomitant Wernicke's encephalopathy."
"A 1950-g female infant was born at 36 weeks' gestation by cesarean section for multiple fetal anomalies to a 25-year-old G5 P2 African American woman. Apgar scores were 2, 2, and 2, at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Amniotic fluid was meconium stained. Prenatal ultrasound at 22 weeks of gestation had revealed a large abdominal wall defect with most abdominal contents lying outside, severe kyphosis of the spine, and a small chest. A prenatal ultrasound at 31 weeks confirmed the gastroschisis and revealed pulmonary hypoplasia, deviation of the heart to the left side of the chest, and a sacral spina bifida (Figures and ). Amniocentesis was performed. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis was normal. Although the patient was informed about the bleak outcome of her fetus, she opted for expectant management. There was no history of in utero exposure to known teratogens. Family history was negative for congenital anomalies. Physical examination of the infant revealed a weight of 1950 g (<5th centile), length of 38 cm (5th centile), and head circumference of 32 cm (40th centile). Multiple anomalies were noted at birth including a large abdominal wall defect, scoliosis, small chest, hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, bulbous tip nose, prominent occiput, and sacral dimples. After intubation and resuscitation in the operating room, the infant was admitted to the NICU where she died within an hour after birth."
"A 25-year-old male presented with sudden loss in vision of right eye (RE) following lifting heavy load. The presenting best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in his RE was 20/200 and left eye (LE) was 20/20. Fundus evaluation of RE revealed well circumscribed dome shaped premacular haemorrhage about 3 disc diameters in size. Since the patient was very apprehensive and requested aggressive treatment, YAG laser hyaloidotomy/membranotomy was done with Zeiss Visuals® YAG III machine with a single shot of 8 mJ applied over inferonasal border of the subhyaloid haemorrhage. At 2-week follow-up, the premacular haemorrhage was noticeably absorbed but he developed 2 full thickness retinal holes near the inferotemporal border of premacular haemorrhage along with empty cavity as bubble over macula. At 4 weeks, the full thickness retinal holes increased to 5 in number (). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed 5 full thickness retinal holes with intact but thickened internal limiting membrane (ILM) detached in convex dome shaped configuration over macula (). Though there was significant resolution of haemorrhage, there was no improvement in his visual acuity. PPV with ILM peel with gas tamponade was done.\nIntraoperatively, brilliant blue was used for staining, and the ILM was intact, but superficial sheen like dome shaped detachment suggestive of thickened ILM was present over the macular area. After PPV, though the fundus image shows persistence of empty bubble/cavity (), there was resolution of hyperreflective convex cavity in the post-PPV OCT () with improvement in BCVA to 20/60. Six months after the onset, the BCVA, fundus examination results and OCT findings were stable."
A healthy 25-year-old male was undergone to facial analysis which showed brachycephalic morphologic type and Class III malocclusion (Figures –). The clinical features and cephalometric measures (McNamara Analysis) were presented in .
"A 25-year-old African American woman, Gravida 7, Para 1, Aborta 5, presented at 29 weeks and 2 days with threatened preterm labor. The patient initially sought care at an outside facility where she received 0.25 mg of terbutaline SC for tocolysis and 12 mg IM of betamethasone for lung maturation. The patient was transferred to our tertiary facility with strong, regular uterine contractions. She underwent a transvaginal ultrasonogram which showed a normal cervical length of 3.4 cm. The patient was placed on continuous cardiotocographic monitoring and started on nifedipine (Procardia) 20 mg every 4 hours, with subsequent administration of the second dose of 12 mg IM betamethasone. Her pregnancy was complicated by opioid abuse, normocytic anemia (hemoglobin on admission 9.9 g/dL), and history of low transverse cesarean section for breech presentation. During the course of her hospitalization, she complained of heart palpitations and chest pain that radiated to her neck. On examination, her pulse palpated as irregularly irregular and vitals revealed a tachycardia into the 140 s. A twelve-lead ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Cardiology was consulted. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and began on diltiazem drip and intravenous metoprolol for rate control. She received a total of six doses of nifedipine during her admission before discontinuation of the medication. Her symptoms occurred within 20 hours from the first dose of nifedipine. Work-up included an echocardiogram, lower extremities venous Doppler, troponin levels, thyroid function test, electrolytes, liver function tests, and a repeat urine drug test. All results were normal apart from borderline magnesium of 1.7 mg/dL (see for further results). The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm in less than 24 hours with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 and anticoagulation with 81 mg aspirin was started. After transfer out of the intensive care unit the patient remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of the hospitalization. Discharge medications included metoprolol 25 mg twice daily for rate control with close outpatient follow-up with MFM and cardiology.\nThe pregnancy culminated with a repeat low-transverse cesarean section at 39-week gestation resulting in a live-born male infant with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively, and birthweight of 3400 grams. Continuous cardiac monitoring for 24 hours following delivery showed sinus rhythm. Per cardiology recommendations she was continued on metoprolol for prophylactic rate control and 81 mg aspirin in the postpartum period until she was seen as an outpatient. During that visit, metoprolol was discontinued."
"Case 6 is a 25-year-old TGNC man, unemployed, living with his partner. The patient was referred for a psychiatric assessment after he disclosed to the GP about using androgens without medical advice and supervision. The patient complained of The Gender Identity Research and Education Society feeling “uneasy with his body” since the age of 12. He started to purchase androgens online, 2 years before the psychiatric assessment, following a protocol available online. The patient also has stage 4 renal failure, and he was under the care of the renal team."
"A 25-year-old transgender woman of Asian origin, who underwent penile inversion vaginoplasty 3 months before, consulted our outpatient clinic with white neovaginal discharge. She worked in the commercial sex industry, was HIV-negative, and engaged in sexual intercourse with more than 10 males in the last 3 months. The sexually transmitted disease workup revealed no presence of STDs. Fungal culturing revealed the presence of Candida albicans, which was treated with miconazole vaginal cream (20 mg/g), inducing symptom relief in a week. At 30 months of clinical follow-up, there was no symptom of recurrence."
"A twenty-five year old Caucasian female was admitted acutely with right iliac fossa (RIF) pain and maximal tenderness over McBurney's point. Past medical history included sciatica and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III. There was no previous surgical history of note.\nAdmission blood tests revealed a haemoglobin of 136 g/L (range 135–160 g/L), white cell count of 16.69 × 109/L (4.0–11.0 × 109/L), neutrophil count of 11.51 × 109/L (2.0–7.5 × 109), a serum amylase of 16 iu/L (25–125 iu/L), and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 194 mg/L (0–5 mg/L). Serum liver and renal function tests on admission and were within normal reference range. Working diagnosis was acute appendicitis and the patient underwent an emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy."
"The second case was a 25-year-old lady in her first pregnancy who was admitted at 39+4 weeks of gestation. She had a BMI of 30 and underwent induction of labour with propess for reduced fetal movement and persistent proteinuria. She then had artificial rupture of the membranes and syntocinon infusion. She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery and gave birth to a female baby weighing 3.3 kg. The placenta was delivered by controlled cord traction. The first stage lasted for six hours. The placenta was delivered 15 minutes after delivery of the baby. She continued to bleed following the delivery of the placenta and the registrar was called. An acute postpartum uterine inversion was diagnosed 5 minutes following the delivery of the placenta. Manual replacement was performed in theatre to correct the inversion. She was continued on syntocinon infusion and was also given intravenous ergometrine, 2 doses of intramuscular and intramyometrial hemabate (carboprost), and Misoprostol 800 micrograms rectally. There was persistent uterine atony and haemorrhage. Estimated blood loss was 4 liters. She was given 5 units of blood, 2 unit fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate. Rusch balloon catheter was inserted to control the haemorrhage. The procedure was performed by senior registrar and 650 mL of saline was used for inflation of the balloon. A vaginal pack was inserted and IV antibiotics were prescribed for 24 hours and oral for further 5 days. Rusch balloon was successful and removed after 24 hours. Removal of catheter was easy and there were no complications recorded."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with a history of left hemipelvectomy due to an accident from her childhood. Her chief complaint was left-side stump pain and right-side phantom pain. She had intermittent electrical-shock-like sensations shooting from her left stump up to her lumbar and then to her right leg. The pain sensations had gradually increased from once a year to every day. Her pain score (VAS) was about a 5 or 6 out of 10. Her physical examination was normal except for allodynia in the stump (at one point). Her lumbosacral MRI was normal. After diagnostic selective nerve root (L4) blockade, she underwent a PRF of the left L4 dorsal root ganglion (L5 was not possible due to anatomic distortion). She was satisfied and reported a 30% decrease in her VAS in 4 months."
"A 25-year-old nulligravida Caucasian female presented with complaints of right sided pelvic pain and sensation of fullness in her lower abdomen. On initial physical exam, a right adnexal mass could be felt. Pelvic ultrasound showed a 14.8 × 7.9 × 12.5 cm structure on the right adnexa. The structure appeared cystic, anechoic with several septations and appeared to be part of the right ovary. No pathological flow was noted and no free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas was seen. The left ovary appeared unremarkable and the uterus was noted to be within normal limits. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. The tumor marker CA 125 was 14.1 (normal range 0–35 U/mL) and CA 19.9 was 9 (normal range 0–37 U/mL).\nThe patient was admitted for a diagnostic laparoscopy, which was converted to exploratory laparotomy. A right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Findings included a large simple-appearing right ovarian cyst occupying the entire right ovary with no normal residual ovarian stroma. An unremarkable left ovary, uterus, appendix, and liver were noted.\nThe structure removed was diagnosed as a mucinous cystadenoma arising in a mature cystic teratoma measuring 15 × 11.5 × 7.5 cm and weighing 668 gm. The pathological report found the surface of the cystic mass to be smooth and intact. On the cut section, the cyst was multilocular and contained clear fluid. The inner wall of the cyst was found to be 5.5 × 2 × .5cm thick with yellow cheesy material. The fimbriae were noted to be fused. The final pelvic wash was found to be negative for malignant cells and positive for reactive mesothelium cells."
"25 y/o male playing Rugby Union at scrum-half position was engaged in full contact training when he received a tackle. The exercise was a simple tackle drill, with two players at a standing start 10 meters apart. One player runs towards the other to initiate a tackle. The patient presented here received the tackle in an unremarkable fashion hitting the ground without loss of consciousness, then stood up briefly before collapsing. He was noted to be unresponsive and received CPR on scene and advanced medical intervention including intubation, placement of IV access and resuscitation before arriving as a trauma alert to UF Health Shands Level I Trauma Center in Gainesville, Florida.\nOn arrival in the trauma bay his vitals were GCS 3 T, HR 60s with a bradycardic episode to 30s that was short lived, and SBP 97 with on-going fluid resuscitation. ATLS primary and secondary surveys were completed along with laboratory investigations. A central line and arterial line were placed along and the patient received a CT head 24 minutes after ambulance arrival. This revealed a diffuse SAH in a non-traumatic pattern. The imaging protocol was then altered in the CT scanner to include a CT angiogram of the head/neck that confirmed a right-sided internal carotid dissection with occlusion of the right ICA at the junction of the right cavernous sinus and supraclinoid ICAs. Mannitol and 3% saline were administered and a ventriculostomy was placed. CSF fluid was noted to be grossly bloody. Maximal medical therapy continued overnight with repeat CT head revealing right ICA dissection, large volume SAH extending into high convexity sulci bilaterally with early central incisural herniation, right MCA and ACA stroke, and right ACA distribution cytotoxic edema.\nAt 24 hrs following admission, the patient was noted to have new left sided pupillary dilatation with ICPs that remained in 70s despite maximal medical therapy.\nHis clinical condition continued to deteriorate and he was pronounced brain dead ~36 hrs after admission with the family electing to withdraw care upon arrival of other family members. Two CT Angiograms demonstrating his Grade IV BCVI injury are provided below (Figures and ).\nA list of Denver BCVI screening criteria is listed below:\nThe Denver criteria for screening for BCVI in context of trauma includes any cervical fracture, unexplained neurological deficit, basal cranial fracture into the carotid canal, Le Fort 2 or 3 fracture, cervical hematoma, cervical bruit, ischemic stroke, or head injury with GCS <6. Below is the University of Florida Severe Brain Injury Protocol which was followed during the treatment of this patient (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented in urology clinic with chief complaint of primary infertility of a 3-year duration. General physical examination was normal. On local examination, patient's right atrophic testis was situated in scrotum and of size 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm. On the other hand, there was empty scrotum on left side which was suggestive of undescended testes. There were no associated congenital anomalies seen. Routine blood investigations, renal function test, and liver function tests were normal. The levels of tumor markers as AFP and beta-hCG were 5 kIU/L and 2.5 kIU/L which were within normal limits. Semen analysis revealed azoospermia. Hormonal study revealed primary testicular failure with elevated gonadotropin levels. Ultrasonography (USG) revealed absence of left sided testis and epididymis in the scrotum and inguinal canal. MRI reported two oblong masses each 2.5 × 1 cm in the left retroperitoneal region anterior and lateral to psoas muscle at L3 to S1 level with atrophied left seminal vesicles (). Patient was taken for laparoscopic assessment and was found to have left sided testicular mass with no lymph nodal enlargement (). On careful examination, it was suggestive for splenogonadal fusion anomaly for which he underwent left orchidectomy (). The specimen was sent for histopathology which showed the tumor mass to be composed of fibrous capsule with red and white pulp within it suggestive of spleen and there was no evidence of spermatogenesis in the testicular portion of resected specimen (). He fared well in postoperative period and was discharged on postoperative day 3. Later, he was followed up on out-patient basis and was doing well."
"A 25-year-old man presented with pain in both knees for four consecutive years and, since 3 months, bilateral groin pain and pain in the gluteal region, radiating to both knees.\nThe patient has been diagnosed with HHR as a child and has been on potassium phosphate and calcitriol tablets ever since. A typical bowing and anteromedial rotation of the tibia was corrected with tibial shaft osteotomies and Ilizarov fixators of both tibias about 10 years ago []. After these procedures, very slow healing of the bone with multiple revisions due to delayed union was observed.\nThe patient has had pain in both knees for four years, more in the right than in the left knee. Initially, at 6 years of follow-up, approximately 4 years ago, MRI of both knees and pelvic X-ray did not reveal any pathological changes other than a strong coxa vara malformation of both hips (). Pain was described by the patient as start-up pain that disappeared or bettered after walking with full weight bearing for a while. Since about 3 months, the pain began to concentrate on both hips radiating in both knees; the same start-up character of the pain was described. Upon questioning, the patient admitted that he has not been taking his medication regularly the last 6 months.\nClinical examination revealed a patient with athletic build, weighting 53 kg and measuring 155 cm. Hip range of motion was (right side/left side) flexion/extension 120/0/0 and 130/0/0, endo-/exorotation 20/0/5 and 20/0/30, and ab-/adduction 10/0/30 and 15/0/30. Trendelenburg's sign was positive on both sides. The patient complained of pain by abduction and exorotation. The Harris and Oxford hip scores were 86 and 43, respectively. Haematological and biochemical parameters were within normal range except for a low phosphate of 1.7 mg/dL (norm: 2.3–4.7) and low potassium of 3.1 mmol/L (norm: 3.5–5.1). Radiographs of hips and pelvis () revealed fractures in both femoral necks. An MRI of the pelvis showed an atrophic nonunion of both fractures ().\nTreatment options were discussed with the patient and a conservative treatment was decided on. The patient was advised to participate in sports that did not involve shock loading of the hip joint, for example, swimming, cycling, and aquajogging. The patient was informed that a prosthetic replacement of the hip could become necessary by further increase of symptoms or necrosis of the femoral head."
"A 25-year-old female exhibited similar skeletal and dental problem with case 1 (Figure ). She wanted conventional orthodontic treatment with labial appliances. For torque control of anterior teeth and total intrusion of maxillary arch, the KILBON system was combined during space closure. She showed crowding before treatment, We applied labial brackets for initial decrowding shortly. She had low palatal vault which restricts the lever arm length, therefore, the design of KILBON system was modified. Three TSADs were installed (two in paramedian area and one in the deepest point of the palatal rugae). The anterior TSAD was used for vertical anchorage before retraction. She wanted more retraction of upper lip after space closure, so the molar tube was splinted to the guide wire by composite resin and the upper dentition was further distalized (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old G2P1011 presented to the Emergency Department with increasing left groin pain that radiated to the mons for the past five days. The patient noticed a small bulge in the groin area over the past five months but denied pain previously. Over the past five days, however, the patient reported having immediate pain after valsalva, for example, after each bowel movement. She denied any urinary symptoms, nausea, or vomiting. She had no significant past medical history or surgical history.\nPhysical exam revealed a 2 cm × 2 cm mass over the left mons abutting the pubic symphysis. The mass was tender to palpation. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and without peritoneal signs. Vital signs were BP 119/67, HR 94, Temp 98.3, and RR 16. Lab studies including chemistry panel, complete blood count, and urine pregnancy test were within normal limits.\nThe patient was initially evaluated by emergency room physicians, and an ultrasound was ordered to further determine the contents of the inguinal mass. The ultrasound report findings suggested “thick walled, complex tubular fluid collection abutting and inseparable from the left ovary and extending into the left groin, possibly representing a dilated and herniated fallopian tube.” Given the concern for possible entrapped organs, a CT scan was ordered, and consultation requests for both General Surgery and OB/GYN were obtained (). The CT findings included “left inguinal hernia containing fluid-filled, tubular structure, possibly a dilated left fallopian tube. Adjacent fluid and stranding, ischemic change cannot be excluded.” ().\nA bedside hernia reduction was attempted but was unsuccessful. The patient was evaluated by OB/GYN and counseled regarding the possibility of unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy if the adnexa appeared to be necrotic. The patient was taken for exploration and she underwent an open left inguinal hernia repair with mesh placement. Examination revealed an indirect hernia containing an incarcerated, dilated fallopian tube with a healthy, viable ovary sitting within the hernia sac. The contents were easily reduced back into peritoneal cavity without difficulty. The inguinal floor was reinforced with Prolene mesh."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported a work-related accident 18 months ago. At the time, he underwent decompressive craniectomy and remained hospitalized at an intensive care unit for a period of two months. Following hospital discharge, due to cosmetic and functional concerns about his craniofacial defect, the patient sought consultation and evaluation from our department. Physical examination showed a significant bony depression at the right frontoorbital region associated with right eye enophthalmos, orbital vertical dystopia, and right eyelid ptosis (Figures –)."
"A 25-year-old male presented with blindness and pain in his left eye. Ophthalmologic examination showed a shrunken, non-functional eye. The pupil was nonreactive to light. Using a slit lamp, a vermiform foreign body was seen in the anterior chamber. The parasite was motile and was removed under local anesthesia. This case was previously reported as a photo quiz . Subsequently, the extracted nymph was morphologically and molecularly examined (unpublished data). The parasite was 9 mm long and 2 mm wide, had 30 annulations, and was surrounded by a partially shed transparent cuticle. The 18S rRNA sequence was the same as that isolated from case 1. Thus, this case was caused by A. grandis (unpublished data). This patient also regularly consumed snake meat."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our outpatient clinic, two months after initial presentation at the Emergency Room because of accidental exposure to bloodborne pathogens. In accordance with the Dutch post-exposure prophylaxis guidelines, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was indicated against possible infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)\n[]. The patient immediately received 500 IU of human hepatitis B immunoglobulin intramuscularly into the right shoulder, and hepatitis B vaccination according to the vaccine dose schedule, at 0, 1 and 6 months. Additionally, the patient received 4 weeks of atazanavir 400 mg with combivir 450 mg (lamivudine/zidovudine) twice daily. Flu-like symptoms occurred in the first week, which subsequently diminished. Following the second intramuscular vaccine dose, the patient complained of neck pain, with radiating pain towards his right shoulder. The patient noticed a deviated position of his right scapula. During the next weeks the pain gradually subsided, but the scapular deviation persisted. No subjective signs of muscle weakness or sensory symptoms were present.On physical examination, the patient had evident scapular winging (Figures \nA-C). Atrophy and weakness were observed for the right supraspinatus muscle. However, a full range of motion was achievable. Thorough neurological examination did not indicate any further deficits. Plain radiography of the right shoulder showed no abnormalities. Electromyography (EMG) recorded two months after initial presentation, showed no neuromuscular abnormalities of the long thoracic or suprascapular nerve.The clinical diagnosis ‘Parsonage-Turner syndrome’ was made. The patient received non-operative treatment. The scapular winging receded during the following 15 months (Figures \nA-C and\nA-C). Full muscle strength was regained. The HIV and HBV serology proved to be negative."
"A 25-year-old female patient on longstanding continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), due to end stage renal disease (ESRD) complicating lupus nephritis, presented with respiratory distress following dialysate infusions. Repeated chest X-rays showed recurrent large right pleural effusions (), requiring repeated therapeutic taps.\nAs a result of her shortness of breath, a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolus (PE) was considered. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed and excluded pulmonary embolus. The CTPA confirmed large right pleural effusion with some underlying consolidation () and small left pleural and large pericardial effusion (). Although the right pleural effusion was large and out of keeping with a systemic cause, the presence of the pericardial effusion and very small left pleural effusion suggested the diagnosis of fluid overload.\nHowever, the patient did not improve with clinical management for fluid overload and at that stage, the possibility of communication between the peritoneal and pleural cavity was considered. Peritoneal scintigraphy was performed using 3mCi Technetium Tc-99m Macroaggregated Albumin (Tc-99m MAA) injected into the abdominal dialysate port. The scan demonstrated a progressive increase in activity in the right lung, confirming the diagnosis of pleuroperitoneal leak (). Peak activity values were measured to quantify the leak, which would be beneficial in treatment decision making as well as in monitoring her progress. Our patient was managed conservatively by changing to biweekly haemodialysis and monitoring her progress closely."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian woman was bitten by a cat dorsal to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint to her right index finger. She was admitted to our clinic with signs of local infection and a possible septic arthritis. Her wound was debrided and irrigated and a partial rupture of her extensor indicis proprius tendon was sutured. The MCP II joint was not affected. With antibiotics and two additional irrigations her wound healed.Over time, chronic discomfort and recurrent episodes of pain and swelling developed in the area. When she was readmitted to our clinic 5 years later she was unable to work (pet-hospital) and her chief complaint was volar and dorsal pain in the distal intermetacarpal space between her second and third finger rays. Conservative treatment such as anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy or immobilization had been insufficient. The range of motion (ROM) in her MCP II-III joints was painful and limited to 0/40 (extension/flexion; Figure A). Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal. Interosseous-lumbrical adhesions involving the dTML were suspected as the symptoms increased in the intrinsic minus and the intrinsic plus finger positioning.\nUnder general anaesthesia, the volar aspect of the painful area was exposed by a zigzag incision as described by Watson et al. []. Adhesions were found between the second lumbrical muscle, the first palmar interosseous muscle, and the dTML. Passive intraoperative motion of her fingers demonstrated impaired excursion and inability of her muscles to move free in relation to the dTML. Release of the adhesions and resection of the distal third of the dTML resulted in normal passive excursion of her muscles without impinging the ligament. Immediate postoperative physiotherapy followed. Six weeks postoperative her hand was pain free and had full ROM (Figure B). The result was consistent over time with normal hand function at the final 12-month follow-up."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a history of secondary amenorrhoea for the past eight months. Her relevant past history revealed chronic anaemia due to thalassaemia minor, menarche at age 13 years and no prior pregnancies. She was found to present normal vital signs and her physical examination was unremarkable. She was not taking any prescribed medication.\nInitial laboratory tests revealed hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism without hyperprolactinaemia and possible but not proven secondary adrenal failure (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a sellar tumour with suprasellar extension (A and B). Computerised visual field (CVF) assessment was normal.\nBased on lesion size and image characteristics, the presumptive diagnosis was a macroadenoma, so glucocorticoid replacement therapy was started and the tumour later resected through a transsphenoidal approach with no complications. After surgery, amenorrhoea persisted and secondary hypothyroidism was detected. Oral contraceptives and thyroxine (50 μg daily) were prescribed.\nThree months later a new MRI of the pituitary gland showed a persistent suprasellar tumour (C and D) in spite of lack of symptoms. Histopathology revealed adenohypophyseal tissue with dense inflammatory lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates (A). IgG4-positive immunostaining was observed in more than ten plasma cells per high power field (40×), confirming IgG4-related hypophysitis diagnosis (B). The new MRI findings and histologically confirmed diagnosis prompted a change in medication from hydrocortisone 15 mg daily to high-dose meprednisone; however, the patient did not accept this treatment although she finally agreed to take meprednisone 8 mg daily. MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not reveal any pathology.\nAn MRI repeated after four months showed significant reduction in the pituitary mass lesion, demonstrating a good response to the low-dose steroids (E and F). After 20 months of follow-up there was no evidence of relapse of the pituitary mass or other organ involvement (not shown). She continued to persist with oral contraceptives and levothyroxine requirements."
"A 25-year-old, right-handed, Caucasian woman noticed the inability to perform certain yoga positions with fatigability and decreased stamina for exercise beginning at the age of 22. She soon developed diplopia, facial and proximal muscle weakness with difficulty lifting her arms above her head and difficulty climbing stairs. She was admitted to a community hospital and had an extensive workup, including brain and spine images as well as serum autoimmune studies, which were normal. She was given one cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which slightly improved her symptoms.\nHer condition deteriorated with difficulty chewing, swallowing, and increasing weakness. She was referred to us and manifested classical significant myasthenic weakness in her extraocular, bulbar and proximal arm and leg muscles. Repetitive nerve stimulation studies revealed 17 percent compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude decrement in the right median nerve and 19 percent in the left spinal accessory nerve. Forced vital capacity was 1.65 liters. Her AChR binding antibody was elevated at 133.06 and blocking antibody was positive at 43. She was classified as MGFA class IVb. Prednisone, IVIG, and pyridostigmine were initiated.\nA chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large anterior mediastinal heterogeneous mass with solid and cystic components measuring 6cm × 4.6cm × 5.2cm with invasion of the pericardium. Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) and anterior mediastinoscopy were performed. An extensive lesion was noted with local adherence to the pulmonary left upper lobe and presence of a left pleural effusion. The invasive thymoma was classified as Masaoka stage III.\nShe received neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide with 45Gy of radiation for tumor reduction. She had a complicated clinical course with numerous myasthenia crises requiring repeated intensive care admission and endotracheal intubation for ventilator support. Plasmapheresis and IVIG were administered at different times. She later underwent a median sternotomy for a radical thymectomy with en bloc resection of a portion of the left upper lobe of the lung. The final pathology showed WHO type B1 with less than 10 percent residual viable tumor. Five months after the initial tumor was biopsied, she was found to have recurrent focus of tumor on the left inferior phrenic nerve margin requiring adjuvant radiation for another six weeks.\nSerial chest imaging showed no evidence of recurrent tumor. She is currently two years post thymectomy and has significantly improved to an MGFA minimal manifestation status (MMS). She is currently maintained on a low dose of both prednisone and pyridostigmine without IVIG."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the Qingdao Municipal Hospital (Shandong, China) with a two-month history of painless swelling on the right side of the face. The medical history of the patient was unremarkable. On clinical examination, a large swelling was identified on the right side of the face that was hard and bony on palpitation. A CT scan revealed a giant, multilocular and hypodense lesion of ~6.5×5.0 cm in size, with a well-defined margin (). The lesion involved the majority of the right maxillary bone, maxillary sinus and zygomatic bone. The third molar tooth was completely impacted (). Based on these observations, a tentative diagnosis of a cyst was proposed.\nUnder general anesthesia, the lesion was enucleated as a whole, using the Caldwell-Luc approach. The tooth that was associated with the lesion was simultaneously removed to avoid tumor fragmentation. Histological examination during the procedure identified a cystic tumor. The wall of the cyst was lined with a stratified squamous epithelium and a corrugated keratinized lining (). A diagnosis of KCOT was determined. To eliminate the possibility of residual cystic tissue, the margin surrounding the lesion was ground and then frozen with liquid nitrogen three times. Prior to the freezing of the surgical site, the adjacent tissues were protected using dry gauze pads. Subsequently, the patient exhibited a good recovery and no recurrence has been observed within the eight-month follow-up duration."
"A 25-year-old man with history of B-ALL presented with subacute onset of abdominal pain and bloating in 06/2012.\nHe was initially diagnosed with B-ALL in 10/2009 based on peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy findings, after presenting with fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. Flow cytometry performed on peripheral blood showed a population of blast forms with weak expression of CD45 and coexpression of CD34, CD20, HLA-DR, CD19, CD10, and TdT. Cytogenetic analysis performed on peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate by conventional karyotyping revealed normal male chromosome complement (46, XY) and was negative for BCR/ABL translocation. FISH was performed using cocktail of probes for the t (9; 22) (BCR-ABL1), t (8; 14) (IGH-MYC, CEP8), and 11q23 (MLL). He received induction chemotherapy with Cytoxan, vincristine, and prednisone followed by hyper-CVAD for consolidation. The follow-up interval bone marrow biopsies and peripheral blood smears on 11/2009 and 11/2010 did not show any evidence of leukemia. He received intensification therapy with methotrexate and L-asparaginase, followed by 9 months of 6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, methotrexate, and prednisone.\nAt presentation, CT scan of abdomen on 6/2012 showed heterogeneously high attenuation with greater omental infiltration as well as associated increased attenuation of the mesenteric fat, which overall was concerning peritoneal lymphomatosis and malignant ascites (). No other intra-abdominal organs were involved. CT-guided biopsy of the omentum revealed diffusely infiltrating blast forms (), which were positive for PAX5 (), TdT (), CD10, and CD20 by immunohistochemistry confirming diagnosis of relapsed B-ALL. Peripheral blood smear during relapse showed several atypical lymphocytes with large nuclei and scant cytoplasm did not have distinct nucleoli but were distinct in appearance from majority of small lymphocytes on smear. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed involvement by B-ALL with 50% blasts and FISH detected trisomy 8. He was treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD). Due to quick regrowth between cycles, rituximab, bortezomib, and decitabine were added between cycles.\nRecently in 2013, four years after initial diagnosis, patient presented with second bone marrow relapse and expired."
"A 25-year-old female with a prolonged history of gastroparesis secondary to intestinal neuronal dysplasia. After presenting with intestinal pseudo-obstruction in May 2006, she underwent multiple surgical interventions, including a partial colectomy, lysis of adhesions, resection of ilieo-colic anastomosis, and repeat ilieo-colic anastomosis. In March 2009, she presented with intestinal dysmotility and liver failure, ultimately undergoing multi-visceral transplantation (en bloc transplant of stomach, pancreas, liver, small bowel, and colon). Following the transplant, she was maintained on rapamycin for immunosuppression. EBV DNA copies were not detected prior to transplant but quickly rose to 3,500 copies following transplant and upon initiation of immune suppression. Her viral level became undetectable on anti-viral therapy.In September 2012, she had a colostomy surgery due to abdominal distention and colonic dysmotility. At the same time, an enlarged left cervical node was noted, and a biopsy was performed. Pathology review of the specimen showed a focal increase in large B cell population, found to be distributed in loose nodules concerning for PTLD. Flow cytometry was attempted but failed due to the low cellularity of the specimen. However, a clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement was detected by PCR, further supporting the possibility of PTLD. In November 2012, the patient noted rapidly increasing abdominal girth. CT imaging demonstrated ascites and a 4.8cm ill-defined soft tissue density in the left suprarenal area. In January 2013, she underwent resection of the left adrenal mass, a mass around the splenic bed, and of an abdominal deposit. Pathology of these areas showed high-grade angiosarcoma with positive surgical margins (Figure \nC). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD34, CD31 (Figure \nD), CAN5.2, factor VIII, c-KIT and inhibin. HHV-8 immunostaining of the tumor was negative. Post-surgical CT scan on 2/2013 showed no evidence of residual disease. The hospital course was further complicated by rejection, treated with anti-thymocyte globulins (ATG) and steroids. Her condition continued to worsen with dyspnea and new inferior vena caval and peroneal venous thrombosis. The patient and family opted for palliative care, and she passed away prior to systemic therapy."
"A 25 years old woman (body mass index, BMI 22Kg/m2), affected by Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (an overgrowth disorder usually present at birth, characterized by an increased risk of childhood cancer and certain congenital features) was admitted urgently with severe pain in the right hypochondrium, acholic stools, hyperchromic urine, nausea, vomiting and fever. Her past medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed jaundice and tenderness in the right hypochondrium with localized rebound and guarding, positive Murphy's sign. Furthermore a distended gallbladder was appreciable. Total bilirubin was 5,44 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 83 IU/ml, alanine aminotransferase 332 IU/ml, alkaline phosphatase 244 IU/ml. The white blood cell count was 7.300/ml. Ultrasonography showed a distended and hydropic gallbladder measuring 14 cm in its longitudinal axis with moderate wall thickening and marked intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No gallstones were seen. Upper abdominal MRI scan (FFE T1 “in and out phase”, TSE T2 and T2 Spir axial scans; TSE T2 Bh coronal scans; cholangiographic FFE T2 radial scans) demonstrated distended gallbladder with homogeneus contents, mild perichepatic and pericholecistic fluid, severe and widespread dilatation of intrahepatic ducts without dark filling defects suggesting biliary lithiasis (Figure ). Furthermore MRI showed gallbladder infundibulum applying a “mass effect” to hepatic hilum. Thus a laparotomic cholecystectomy was uneventfully performed. During surgery a massively dilated, edematous gallbladder very close to the hepatic hilum was found. Pathologic examination of the gallbladder showed evidence of severe acute inflammation and epithelial necrosis but no stones in the gallbladder or cystic duct. No carcinoma was evident. She was discharged after 5 days with a complete recovery. Antiobiotcs were administered for three days after surgery. Postoperative course was uneventful during the three months follow-up.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal."
"25-year old woman and her husband were referred to clinical genetics unit due to four pregnancy failures. First pregnancy (anencephalic) was terminated at 19th week of gestation. At 6th week of the second pregnancy blighted ovum was found. Third pregnancy underwent spontaneous abortion at 6th week of gestation. The fourth pregnancy was extrauterine.\nThe physical examination did not reveal any phenotypic abnormalities or any congenital malformations in either partner.\nA history of reproductive problems was reported in maternal family members (see Figure showing pedigree). Our patient’s mother had difficulties to conceive, her second pregnancy was spontaneously aborted. She also gave birth to a girl who died before the age of one month due to congenital malformations. The only sister of patient’s mother has one son with heart defect and one healthy daughter. The wife of the brother of patient’s mother had two spontaneous abortions. Maternal grandmother had one spontaneous abortion.\nPatient’s father has two healthy sons from his second relationship. Wife of father’s brother underwent a spontaneous abortion of her only pregnancy. Paternal history was otherwise unremarkable.\nFamily of patient’s husband did not have any history of reproductive health problems."
"A 25-year-old Turkish Caucasian man with homozygous (Hb SS) SCD presented to our emergency department with a sudden, painless loss of vision in the left eye for the preceding two hours. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye and counting fingers in the left eye. Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present in the left eye. His anterior segment examination was normal bilaterally and his intraocular pressure was 21mmHg in both eyes, as measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Fundus examination revealed a pale and thickened retina, suggesting retinal edema centered on the papillomacular bundle, in addition to increased vascular tortuosity in the left eye (Figure a). His right fundus was normal. A fundus fluorescein angiography (Figure b) showed lack of arterial filling of the artery, delayed arteriovenous transit time at 21 seconds, and peripheral capillary non-perfusion in the left eye. His retinal vasculature was normal in the right eye. An optical coherence tomography showed increased central foveal thickness (CFT) and inner retinal layer thickening in the left eye. The CFT at baseline was 403μm (Figure a). He was subsequently diagnosed with left CRAO.\nHe was hospitalized immediately with the aim of decreasing the blood viscosity. To restore vascular perfusion, hematologists started emergent exchange transfusion within three hours following admission. His BCVA did not change immediately after transfusion. Thus, in addition to the systemic therapy, a HBO therapy was planned, and started within the first 24 hours of admission. The treatment protocol was 2.5 ATA (atmosphere absolute) for 120 minutes twice daily for the first seven days, and then once a day for the following six days, for a maximum total of 20 sessions. An improvement in BCVA to 20/200 was observed after two sessions (24 hours), and to 20/60 at the end of 20 sessions. At the three-month visit his BCVA had increased to 20/30, and remained so until his last visit at six months. At the last visit his fundus examination showed the recovery of retinal ischemia (Figure c) and OCT scan showed CFT to be 200μm (Figure b)."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian male was brought to ED with sudden onset weakness in the proximal lower extremity muscles. The patient reported no history of trauma. Vision and mental status were normal. Further questioning revealed that the patient ate a large portion of pasta several hours prior. The patient also reported a history of less severe episodes of weakness over several months, usually on weekend nights, sometimes after ingestion of alcohol. Symptoms resolved spontaneously within hours. Family history was unobtainable as patient was adopted. On presentation, heart rate was 117/min and blood pressure (BP) was 176/85 mm/Hg.\nExamination revealed no proptosis, diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, without bruit or nodules. His muscle strength was 0/5 in lower extremity proximal muscles, with no sensory deficits, with upper extremities being 5/5 bilaterally. There was no impairment of cognitive or cerebellar function. His hands exhibited tremors, and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were brisk bilaterally without fasciculations or clonus. Remainder of the examination was normal.\nLaboratory data showed abnormal results for creatinine kinase, 531 U/L (normal range 38–174 U/L) and serum potassium, 1.7 mEq/L (normal range 3.5–5 mEq/L). Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with left ventricular hypertrophy. He had biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism with the following values: total serum thyroxine (T4) = 18.4 mcg/dL (normal range 5 to 12 mcg/dL), free T4 = 4.2 ng/dL (normal range 0.7 to 1.9 ng/dL), and T3 = 255 ng/dL (normal range 60−180 ng/dL). TSH was <0.005 (normal range 0.4 to 4.5 microU/mL). Urinary potassium was normal. Thyroid uptake and scan showed radioactive iodine uptake consistent with Graves' disease (48.2% at 2 hours and 66% at 24 hours).\nIn ED, the patient was treated with hydration and potassium supplementation. Potassium returned to normal (3.5–5 mEq/L) with infusion of 40 mEq. Eight hours later, the patient regained total lower body strength. He was started on propylthiouracil and propranolol and scheduled for outpatient follow-up. Propylthiouracil was chosen as it was covered by his insurance plan. He developed postablative hypothyroidism after being treated with I131 12 millicuries for definitive management and was started on thyroid replacement therapy. He remained euthyroid for six months after which he was lost to follow up."
"A 25-year-old African woman was referred to the Endocrine Clinic with a 4-month history of bi-temporal headaches and amenorrhoea. The headaches were episodic and associated with photophobia and nausea. She attained menarche at the age of 11 and her periods had previously been regular. She had been trying to conceive for 2 years without success. She also had a weight gain of nearly 9 kg over a span of 6 months. Clinical examination revealed no systemic abnormalities. Visual fields were full to confrontation testing.\nHer past medical history was complex. A year before the endocrine review, she was reviewed in the respiratory clinic with a dry cough. Serial chest radiographs confirmed a bulky right hilum and paratracheal region with presumed enlarging lymphadenopathy. There were no systemic symptoms of weight loss, night sweats or fevers. She had been in the UK for 5 years before presentation, and had had no contacts with TB. She complained of a painful right shoulder, and magnetic resonance (MR) scan of the affected side revealed a soft tissue mass in the suprascapular bursa which extended to the inferior glenoid pouch. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was undertaken and revealed a core of normal tissue with no evidence of malignancy or infection. No acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were seen. She declined to undergo mediastinoscopy and was treated empirically with anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) for a total of 9 months (initially 3 months and subsequently completed a 6 month course). Significant radiological improvement of chest lymphadenopathy was noted on serial CT imaging."
25-year-old male presented to otorhinolaryngology out-patient department with chief complaints of nasal discharge and headache on and off since childhood. Neurological examination was carried out and was reported to be normal. Patient was referred to radiodiagnosis department where the patient was taken up for X-ray paranasal sinuses water's view which showed opacification of bilateral maxillary antrum (Figures and ). As the X-ray findings were inconclusive provisional diagnosis of sinusitis was made and antibiotic treatment was started. Patient was unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. After these CT paranasal sinuses were done on SIEMENS machine mode SOMATOM. The study revealed bilateral opacified and hypoplastic cleft like maxillary sinuses with narrowing of infundibular passage with absent uncinate process with enlarged nasal fossae; however the orbits appeared normal. On the basis of CT findings and patient presentation diagnosis of bilateral hypoplastic maxillary sinuses type 3 [] was made.
A 25-year-old male patient reported to the department with the chief complaint of swelling in the lower left back tooth region for the last year. On extraoral examination we could palpate a swelling approximately of the size 6 cm × 3 cm extending from the commissure of lip to the posterior border of the mandible. On intraoral palpation there was expansion of buccal and lingual cortical plates and perforation of lingual cortical plates. Incisional biopsy was done. It revealed plexiform ameloblastoma. The patient was operated on under GA. Segmental resection with disarticulation of the left mandible was done followed by reconstruction with microvascular fibula free flap using reconstruction plate. A regular follow-up is being done. There is no sign of recurrence.
"The patient was a 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and swelling of his face and neck when he lay down. He complained of recent faint attacks in the last few weeks. Physical examination, chest radiography, and blood analysis were found to be normal. An echocardiography showed mild diastolic dysfunction and a cysts-like structure inside the pericardial cavity. The computerized tomography (CT) confirmed 8 × 7 cm cystic structure situated between the aortic arch and right pulmonary artery (). We decided to surgically remove the mass lesion to treat myocardial diastolic dysfunction and for an accurate histopathologic diagnosis after the consent of the patient.\nFollowing standard median sternotomy, the pericardium was opened and 8 × 7 cm in diameter cystic structure was detected (). After mobilizing the cyst from the right atrium, aorta, and the right pulmonary artery, it could be en bloc resected (). The cyst was removed from the operating table to another table and cut. Yellow, jelly-like liquid was drained. Specimens for microbiology and histopatologic examination were obtained. A frozen section excluded malignancy and indicated a benign cystic lesion of bronchogenic origin. The cavity left after the removal of the cyst was covered with pericardium and the operation was finished uneventfully.\nThe patient was taken to the intensive care unit and weaned off mechanic ventilation in 6 hours. He was taken to the ward next day and discharged from the hospital on the postoperative 5th day. Microbiologic examination ended sterile and bronchogenic cyst diagnosis was confirmed with detailed histopathologic examination. The patient is followed regularly for more than 1 year at the outpatient clinic, and he was found to be asymptomatic throughout the followup period."
"A 25-year-old male presented with paroxysmal left upper limb tics and weakness that had been ongoing for two years. The involuntary limb tics exhibited a sudden onset and lasted for seconds, but were not accompanied by consciousness disturbance. The patient had approximately 10 attacks per day, which were accompanied by limb weakness. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed initially and was found to be normal. The patient had received irregular diazepam administration from the onset of the disease; however, the symptoms became increasingly more serious. The patient was prescribed 600 mg per day valproate sodium on admission to hospital to control the seizures, but experienced one or two attacks per month subsequent to the administration of valproate sodium. The past medical history of the patient was unremarkable. On examination, the patient was alert and his pupils adjusted to light. Neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves, but decreased deep tendon reflexes and a decreased sensation of touch, pain and vibration. The gait of the patient was broad and he was unable to walk in a straight line. Full strength was observed in all the muscle groups. The results of the Romberg, heel-knee-shin and finger-to-nose tests were normal. An electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed diffuse spikes and slow waves, predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes (). A further MRI scan was performed and revealed increased signal density on T2-weighted imaging and decreased signal density on T1-weighted imaging in the right temporal occipital cortical lesions. Local cortical atrophy was also observed in the left temporal-occipital cortex. In addition, the lactic acid concentration (5.2 mmol/l) had markedly increased. The results of the carotid ultrasound and electromyography were normal. A biopsy of the biceps muscle demonstrated a variation in fiber size and the presence of ragged-red fibers (). In addition to the prescribed 600 mg per day valproate sodium, the patient was administered 10 mg per day coenzyme Q10 for approximately 2 years. Two years later his symptoms relieved and an EEG showed less spikes and slow waves than it had previously shown."
"In 2011, a 25-year-old Caucasian female developed ESRD due to aHUS. Her initial symptom was shortness of breath and she was found to have severe hypertension, acute kidney injury with serum creatinine of 11.4 mg/dl, anemia with hemoglobin of 5 g/dl, elevated LDH, and thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 20,000/dl. Additional work-up revealed schistocytosis on peripheral smear. She underwent kidney biopsy that revealed TMA involving glomeruli and small vessels. A diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/HUS was initially made. She received high-dose pulse steroids and four sessions of plasmapheresis. Despite therapy, the disease continued to progress and the patient became hemodialysis dependent. One year later, she was evaluated in our institution for kidney transplantation. Our work-up included ADAMTS13 level, which came back normal and genetic analysis, which confirmed a mutation (c.1933dup A) of complement factor-H (CFH), a variant in exon 13 (SCR11) of the gene CFH. This variant has been identified before and most likely associated with aHUS (personal communication with the Molecular research renal laboratory at the University of Iowa). In mid-2014, she underwent living unrelated kidney transplant. Twenty-four hours prior to transplantation, she received a dose of eculizumab 1200 mg intravenously (IV). Immunosuppression consisted of induction therapy with four doses of intravenous thymoglobulin and 4-day methylprednisolone taper, and maintenance therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. She had immediate graft function and her serum creatinine was 1.0 mg/dl at the time of discharge. After transplantation, she received weekly eculizumab 900 mg IV for 4 weeks started on day 1 post-transplant, and then 1200 mg IV biweekly starting at week 5 post-transplant; we have utilized the eculizumab protocol recommended by the manufacturing company. Serum complement 3 (C3) level was 37 mg/dl (normal 79–152 mg/dl) at the time of the transplantation and increased to 58 mg/dl 3 months post-transplant. Haptoglobin and LDH levels were normal at the time of transplantation and remained normal afterwards. Hemoglobin was 9.5 g/dl at the time of transplantation and increased to 12.5 g/dl few weeks after. Renal allograft function has remained stable with most recent serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dl."
"A 25-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) presented to another institution 6 weeks post-partum with low-grade fever, generalized malaise, nausea, and dyspnea on exertion. Two transient episodes of aphasia with bilateral lower facial weakness were also reported. She had recently been restarted on prednisone 40 mg daily after developing dyspnea and pleuritis, thought to be an exacerbation of MCTD, which was characterized by positive antinuclear antibodies, anti-Smith antibody, and anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody. Anti-topoisomerase antibodies (anti-Scl-70) and anti-centromere antibodies were negative. Upon presentation, she had uncontrolled hypertension, periorbital edema, and livedo reticularis. On admission to our institution, she was noted to have non-oliguric acute kidney injury with serum creatinine 4.3 mg/dl, nephrotic range proteinuria, normocytic anemia with hemoglobin 10.4 g/dl, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 63 × 109/l. As illustrated in , the anemia and thrombocytopenia were progressive, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated. Haptoglobin level was low at 23 mg/dl. Complement levels were normal. Rare schistocytes were seen on peripheral blood smear, consistent with hemolysis. A renal biopsy was performed, revealing active and chronic thrombotic microangiopathy () by light microscopy processed urgently. In view of recent neurologic symptoms, acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and history of low grade fever, a presumptive diagnosis of TTP was made. Plasma exchange was initiated emergently, and prednisone was increased to 80 mg daily with subsequent improvement in platelet count and LDH. In addition, hemodialysis was initiated for worsening kidney injury.\nAfter four sessions of plasma exchange, however, LDH began to rise despite normalization of haptoglobin and resolution of schistocytes on peripheral smear (). The ADAMTS13 level, sent prior to initiation of plasma exchange, returned as normal. As the patient’s course evolved, the concern was raised for a possible scleroderma process rather than a manifestation of chronic TTP. Plasma exchange was discontinued, and the patient was initiated on captopril for presumed scleroderma renal crisis. Her previous antihypertensive regimen had consisted of amlodipine, metoprolol, and clonidine. While the microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia resolved, renal function did not improve, and she remained dialysis dependent 5 months after the initial diagnosis."
"A 25-year-old right-handed Ethiopian man presented with a 2-year history of generalized weakness and wasting of his face, hands and feet. He often complained of stiffness and had difficulty in releasing his grip, as following a hand shake. He also has slow and difficult swallowing, and excessive daytime sleepiness. There was no history of fever, neck stiffness, ear discharge, or trauma. He had been on treatment for idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) for over 15 years, and was admitted for an episode of severe pneumonia in the preceding month. His family history is positive for DM in his mother and younger brother, and IGE in his elder brother. There was no past history of diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary tuberculosis, syphilis, alcohol or tobacco intake, or other substance abuse.\nHe was thin built and without anemia, jaundice, or cyanosis. His cortical functions were normal. His speech was nasal. His face was long and narrow with hollowed cheeks and sagging jaw, and frontal baldness. His masseter, pterygoid and temporalis muscles were weak bilaterally. He had no cataract. Intrinsic muscles of his hand, muscles of his distal forearm, and ankle dorsiflexors were moderately weak and atrophied on both sides. There were clinical hand grip and percussion myotonia. His superficial and muscle stretch reflexes were normal. His primary and cortical sensations were normal. His gait was high stepping. The result of examination of his other system organs was normal.\nThe results of his routine hematologic and chemistry laboratory tests were normal. His serum fasting blood glucose, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were normal. His serum muscle enzymes and a routine electroencephalogram were normal. A needle electromyography showed insertional classic myotonic discharges. A nerve conduction study showed mild axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy.\nA muscle biopsy showed marked increase of internalized nuclei (arrayed in chains in longitudinal section), severely atrophic muscle fibers with pyknotic nuclear clumps, muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration of isolated muscle fibers, architectural changes such as sarcoplasmic masses and ring fibers, and a preferential atrophy of type I fibers (Figure ).\nHe was subsequently discharged after he improved after pneumonia and his seizures were controlled with 300mg of phenytoin per day."
"Case 2 is a 25-year-old, left-handed, White Hispanic man with moderate mental retardation and medically refractory seizures that he began experiencing at age 1 year, secondary to tuberous sclerosis. His seizures commence typically with sudden body stiffening for 30 seconds with ictal cry, followed by tonic–clonic seizure, on occasion. Seizure frequency had increased over time, and he often experienced seizures three to four times per day. He had been treated previously with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and topiramate. Approximately 5 years ago, he underwent vagus nerve stimulator implantation, which improved his seizures only slightly.\nWhen he first presented to an epilepsy center, he had been receiving levetiracetam, valproate, and clonazepam, but reported having ongoing and frequent seizures. His neurologic examination showed moderate cognitive difficulty, slurred speech, and mild right-arm weakness. Further, his right hand was smaller than his left. He was able to ambulate on his own, but swayed left and right with wide-base stance. His previous EEG showed diffuse background slowing, which was focally more in the left hemisphere. Interictal epileptiform discharges were detected mainly from the left frontotemporal region, along with occasional sharp discharges from the right hemisphere. His brain MRI showed subependymal nodules bilaterally and transmantle dysplasia over the left parietal lobe. Initial scalp ictal EEG indicated diffuse bilateral seizure onset during his initial body stiffening. However, better ictal progression was observed over the left hemisphere just prior to the progression of tonic–clonic phase. A subsequent intracranial grid electrode guided study revealed diffuse seizure onset, but maximally over the left frontal and parietal lobes near the transmantle dysplasia.\nHe underwent surgical resection of the dysplasia, but his seizures did not improve significantly. Because of his frequent seizures, clobazam was started and gradually replaced clonazepam, as indicated in Table .\nHis family reported that his seizure improvement was notable at Week 2, and his seizures became milder and less frequent (>80% reduction), without significant adverse effects from clobazam. During the next 6 months, his clobazam dosage was gradually increased to 15mg twice daily. His seizure frequency further improved to one to two per week. Moreover, 1 month after his clobazam dosage increase, his levetiracetam dosage was decreased by 50%. He and his family are quite happy with the improvement, and had reported that he has become more active."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the endocrine clinic in November 2011 with a history of tiredness, reduced libido and bilateral large testicles, which he wanted surgically removed .\nHe had been diagnosed with salt-losing CAH during his antenatal period and commenced on steroid replacement therapy soon after birth. However, he stopped taking all medications in 2000 because of family issues and although his testicles were felt to be lumpy in 2002, further investigation was hampered by poor compliance to treatment and follow-up. He did see the urologist in 2007 but failed to attend follow-up appointments and scans thereafter. He reappeared in the urology clinic in 2010 and again in 2011, after which he was re-referred to the endocrinology department by the urologist in readiness for testosterone replacement therapy after the proposed orchidectomy.\nOn examination he was well with normal secondary sexual features, but his testicles felt hard and three times the normal size. His serum testosterone level was 50.4 nmol/l. After the baseline investigations (see ) and multiple non-attendances, he finally had bilateral orchidectomy and prosthesis replacement in October 2012. Further follow-up was difficult, and compliance with steroid replacement was again very poor."
"At presentation, the proband was a 25-year-old white female G2P1011 with regular menses, who conceived spontaneously without medical intervention (Patient I1 in Figure A). Her physical exam was normal except for short stature (4′9″). Her first pregnancy resulted in the birth of a normal, healthy girl (II1) with short stature (<2.5%), but her second pregnancy ended at 20 weeks with the birth of a stillborn male (II2) with hydrocephalus (Figure A) who did not have a full autopsy. Of interest, upon second trimester analyte screening, her serum unconjugated estriol was undetectable. Karyotype of the stillborn male II2 revealed 46,Y,der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;q11.2). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated ish der(X)t(X;Y)(wcpY+,wcpX+), with the presence of the KAL1 (Kallmann syndrome-1) region and deletion of the STS (steroid sulfatase) locus, narrowing the breakpoint region on Xp22."
"A 25-year-old female office worker visited the clinic of the Center for Kampo Medicine in Keio University Hospital. She suffered from severe menstrual pain since she was 20 years old and it turned to be worse when she started to work in the company. Also severe constipation started around that time. On the time of her visit, her bowel movement was once in 5 days. After she began to work, she was annoyed by acne and abdominal distension after meals. Physical examination revealed that she was 160 cm in height and 50 kg in weight; her body mass index was 19.5, blood pressure was 106/59 mmHg, and pulse was regular and at 63 per minute. Complexion and skin were normal. There were no abnormal findings on blood and urine analysis. Gynecological examination revealed no abnormal findings such as endometriosis. Tongue inspection revealed swelling of the sublingual vein. Abdominal strength was slightly strong; there were resistance in the hypochondrium and abdominal distention. We diagnosed the patient with excess heat, qi stagnation, and blood stasis pattern and prescribed 7.5 g of daisaikoto per day. Her constipation improved in 2 weeks. Twelve weeks later, she reported that her menstrual pain disappeared. Since then she has been free from a menstrual pain with daisaikoto."
"A 25-year-old Chinese female patient presented with a two-month history of red plaques on her face. The lesion grew progressively in size, with occasional pain and pruritus. The patient had no particular previous medical history, and was otherwise healthy, with no history of fever, malaise or weight loss. There was no mucosal involvement. The results of a general physical examination were normal, with no signs of lymph node enlargement. However, a dermatological examination showed indurated erythematous plaques with a number of reddish-yellow nodules on the left side of the patient’s face ().\nThe biopsy specimen obtained from the afflicted area showed that the epidermis was normal, but revealed dense inflammatory infiltrates, composed of neutrophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes and histiocytes, in the dermis. No significant histiocytic atypia was identified. The histiocytes exhibited abundant, focally foamy cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei; lymphocytes and plasma cells were observed within the cytoplasm of these histiocytes (emperipolesis; ). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the histiocytes were strongly positive for S100 protein, weakly positive for CD68 and negative for CD1a (). Thus, the diagnosis of CRDD was confirmed. Laboratory examination revealed no abnormality in routine tests, including the blood count, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels, liver and kidney function tests and muscle enzymes. In addition, the serum protein level and collagen vascular screening tests (antinuclear antibodies, C3, C4) were normal.\nThe patient was treated with a twice-daily topical application of mometasone furoate 0.1% cream for one month. In addition, local injections of 1 mg compound betamethasone were administered once a month for two months. The plaque treated with local injections of the steroid showed improvement. However, the patient declined to continue with the injection therapy due to side-effects, including increased blood pressure and weight gain, from the systematic use of corticosteroids. The patient showed slight improvement in the three months of outpatient follow-up which involved a telephone call every month. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to participation in the present study."
"Patient 4: A 25-year-old woman who had been affected by AAG for at least 5 years and who had severe constipation. She developed orthostatic intolerance, dry mouth and eye (left), photophobia, and reduced sweating on the right side of the face. An examination revealed Adie’s tonic pupil (left), loss of deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities, preserved sensations, and normal muscle strength. We confirmed the orthostatic hypotension (supine, 108/58 mmHg; standing, 75/32 mmHg). Autonomic function tests confirmed generalized autonomic failure. She had developed several autonomic symptoms since the first episode of amenorrhea at the age of 20. The level of the gAChRα3 antibody was 3.520 A.I. She was treated with plasma exchange (PE) and showed improvements in orthostatic intolerance, deep tendon reflexes, and Adie’s tonic pupil in response to PE that was followed by oral prednisolone. Surprisingly, menstruation started again after a series of immunotherapy. The level s of the anti-gAChRα3 antibody remained positive in this patient, but with a substantially reduced (1.151 A.I.)."
"A 25-year-old female patient was referred to the Oral Diagnosis service in Fortaleza (Ceará/Brazil) to evaluation of an asymptomatic nodule in the premolars region of the mandible lasting two months. Extra-oral examination did not reveal changes in the oral and maxillofacial region. Intra-oral examination exhibited an intraosseous swelling of the buccal cortical in the left premolar region of the mandible. Panoramic radiograph revealed a well-defined unilocular radiolucency between left canine and first pre-molar of the mandible measuring 3 x 2 cm, which produced anterior displacement of the canine roots. Radiopaque foci within the lesion and resorption of adjacent teeth roots were not observed (Fig. ). The radiographic differential diagnosis of the lesion included lateral periodontal cyst, glandular odontogenic cyst, early-stage ossifying fibroma, central odontogenic fibroma, and extra-follicular odontogenic adenomatoid tumor. Under local anesthesia, the patient was submitted to an excisional biopsy through simple enucleation followed by bone curettage. Microscopically, tumor presented strands of polyhedral eosinophilic cells with well-defined borders, distinct intercellular bridges, clear cytoplasm and nuclei pleomorphism interspersed with focal areas of amyloid deposition and presence of irregular calcified structures. The amyloid material was positive for Congo red staining, which exhibited apple–greenish birefringence under polarized light analysis (Fig. ). The final diagnosis was of clear cell variant of calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor. The tumor cells were also immunopositive for AE1/AE3 (AE1/AE3, 1:500, Dako), CK14 (LL 002, 1:200, Novocastra), and focally for CK19 (RCK 108, 1:200, Dako) in a cytoplasmic pattern; β-catenin (17 C 2, 1:200, Novocastra) and CD138 (My 15, 1:100, Dako) showed positivity in membrane pattern; and virtually all tumor cells were positive for p63 (4A4, 1:300, Dako) in a nuclear pattern (Fig. ). The Ki-67 (MIB-1, 1:100, Dako) index was 2%. After 24 months of follow-up, the patient does not present any clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrence."
"A twenty-five-year-old female presented to her student health clinic with increasing abdominal fullness, left-sided lower back pain, and left lateral thigh numbness that had been worsening over the course of several months. Family and medical history were unremarkable. Physical exam was significant for a large fixed mass in the left upper and lower quadrants of the abdomen. She had an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen of 49. Computed tomographic scan (CT) showed a large retroperitoneal mass with cystic and solid components ().\nThe patient underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy of the solid portion of the mass. The specimen (evaluated by two pathologists) was consistent with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, with intestinal morphology.\nThe patient subsequently underwent a colonoscopy and a gynecologic exam, neither of which revealed any abnormalities. Positron emission tomography scan showed avidity of the primary lesion but no distant metastatic disease.\nA referral to our center was made. The patient underwent a laparotomy and resection of a well-encapsulated 21 × 15 × 13 cm retroperitoneal mass (). The tumor was densely adherent to the iliac bone. Biopsies of the mesentery and the omentum were also taken. Her postoperative course was unremarkable and the patient was discharged on postoperative day number eight.\nThe mass consisted of a cystic cavity lined by complex tubulopapillary formations composed of columnar cells with high-grade nuclei, multinucleated cells, and frequent atypical mitotic figures. Pathology determined that the mass was most consistent with a primary retroperitoneal mucinous tumor (PRMT) with an associated invasive moderate-to-poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ()."
"A 25-year-old female presented with the complaint of episodes of high grade fever and cervical lymphadenopathy requiring multiple hospitalizations. The patient developed low grade fever with headache three months before for which she was initially prescribed NSAIDS on outpatient basis. Subsequently, she was admitted in an outside hospital for further investigation and management. Her routine hemogram, urine and blood cultures, chest X-ray, and ultrasound of the abdomen were normal. No significant lymphadenopathy was noted. She responded to conservative management and was discharged after defervescence in 4-day time.\nAfter three weeks, she noticed 3-4 small nodular swellings in the neck. She developed high grade fever and headache, following which she was admitted in the hospital. At the time of admission, she had stable vitals and four enlarged, firm, and discrete lymph nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck. There were no meningeal signs. Her routine hemogram showed leukopenia (TLC-3200/μL). Other investigations including urine and blood cultures, a contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the chest and abdomen along with lumbar puncture, and CSF examination were noncontributory. She was given symptomatic and supportive treatment and the fever subsided and the lymph nodes regressed. She was discharged in two-week time.\nAfter two weeks, she was again hospitalized with high grade fever and headache. Clinical examination revealed multiple, enlarged, firm, enlargement of cervical and axillary lymph nodes of size about two centimeters. She was again subjected to extensive investigations including lumbar puncture and CSF examination, all of which were noncontributory except for mild anaemia, leukopenia, and raised ESR (70 mm in first hour). Immunological tests like ANA and RF were within normal limits. CECT of chest and abdomen was done and revealed enlarged axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy. Excision biopsy of cervical lymph nodes and histopathological examination was done and revealed multiple well circumscribed areas of necrosis with histiocytes and marked karyorrhexis (). These features were suggestive of KFD. To exclude the differential diagnosis of infective aetiology stains for acid fast bacilli and fungus were performed which were negative. The patient was given symptomatic and supportive treatment and was discharged in afebrile condition in one week. She is asymptomatic at 4 months follow-up."
"A 25-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with a complaint of longstanding right-sided profound hearing loss. Her hearing impairment had begun 15 years ago. At that time, she suffered traumatic tympanic membrane perforation due to penetration by an ear pick. She had sudden profound hearing loss at the onset of injury and it was unclear that she had felt vertigo after injury. Conservative therapy was performed at ENT clinic nearby. Although perforation of tympanic membrane was healed completely, profound hearing loss had remained. She mentioned the degree of hearing loss had not changed. She had felt lightheadedness about 7 years ago.\nAn otoscopic examination revealed no perforation in her right ear, but pure tone audiometry showed right profound hearing loss (). Imaging of temporal bone using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) showed a round low density area in the vestibule and intrusion of stapes into the vestibule (). A diagnosis of pneumolabyrinth was made and PLF was suspected. The patient refused surgical intervention and chose to receive outpatient follow-up and no medication.\nTwo years later, she was admitted again for follow-up of hearing loss. She sometimes had dizziness or lightheadedness. Pure tone audiometry showed right profound hearing loss similar to before (). Equilibrium tests showed no positional or positioning vertigo. A caloric test indicated that right vestibular function was slightly decreased, but not abolished. Reexamination by CBCT showed that air that had been present in the right vestibule had disappeared (). We recommended probe tympanotomy to confirm and cure PLF, but the patient rejected surgical intervention and requested course observation."
"A 25-year-old man was diagnosed as having a CML in December 2012. At diagnosis, physical examination revealed palpable spleen and liver. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis(137 × 109/L))with 2.5%myeloblasts,3.4%promyelocytes, 87.1%neutrophils, 6% eosinophils, and 1% basophils. The Hb was 11.3 g/dL and PLT 152 × 109/L. Lactate dehydrogenase level was 2782 IU/dL. Bone marrow examination showed hypercellularity with myeloid hyperplasia with 2.4% myeloblasts, 2.8% promyelocytes, 20% myelocytes, 18% metamyelocytes, 6% eosinophils, 0% basophils (Figure ). Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow trephine showed the typical features of chronic phase CML. Cytogenetic studies on marrow specimen showed a 46XY karyotype with t(9;22)(q34;q11) in all of 20 metaphase cells. Ph-positive ratio in bone marrow cells analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was 21.2% (Figure ). The BCR/ABL 210 fusion transcript was found by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and BCR/ABL 190 fusion transcript wasn’t detected.\nHe was initially treated with hydroxyurea. About one month later, he went on to hematological remission. Then the patient was treated with imatinib mesylate (IM 400 mg, qd) for more than one year. At 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after diagnosis, BCR/ABL 210 fusion transcript detected by RT-PCR was still positive and BCR/ABL 190 fusion transcript was negative. In April 2014, he began to appear unexplained high fever with ineffective antibiotic treatment and a rise in WBC was detected. Bone marrow examination showed hypercellularity with myeloid hyperplasia with 25% myeloblasts. Flow cytometry analysis showed blasts accounted for 21.88% of the total cells and were positive for CD34, CD38, HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CD117, CD9 and negative for MPO, cyCD3, cyCD79a, CD19, CD3, CD2, which suggested this patient entered into blast crisis (BC). Both BCR/ABL 210(0.83 BCRABL⁄ABL ratio) and BCR/ABL 190(0.001BCRABL⁄ABL ratio) fusion transcript were positive. He was treated with HA (HHA 4 mg d1-7,Ara-C 200 mg d1-7) and MA(MIT 10 mg d1-3, Ara-C 200 mg d1-7) regimen. However, hematological remission was not obtained. In June 2014, he was treated with HAG (HHA 2 mg d1-14, Ara-C 25 mg × 2 d1-14, G-CSF 300ug d1-14). Fortunately, he could achieve partial hematological remission after this induction chemotherapy and BCR/ABL 190 fusion transcript Gene turned to negative. Imatinib resistance was confirmed by a screening for ABL kinase domain E255K mutations, and dasatinib was administered. After two months, the patient went on to hematological remission."
"A 25-year-old female was referred to the Unit of Maxillo-Facial Surgery at the Civil Hospital in Brescia by her dentist for an evaluation of a painless radiolucency in the right mandibular ramus.\nThe extra- and intraoral evaluation reveal no swelling, cortical expansion, or mucosal anomalies; there was no limitation of mouth opening, no alteration of the mandibular movement, and no history of trauma or cancer in her family. No damage of the inferior alveolar nerve was revealed.\nThe orthopantomography showed a radiolucency in the right mandibular ramus ().\nA computer tomographic (CT) scan revealed a well circumscribed radiolucent unilocular image with sclerotic margins involving the mandibular ramus ().\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a hyperintense neoformation in the T1 and T2 sequences; in the sequences with fat suppression the lesion showed a signal reduction (Figures and ).\nAs the CT scan and MRI strongly indicated a benign lesion, no exploratory biopsy was performed.\nUnder local anesthesia (Mepivacaine 0.2% with 1 : 100.000 adrenaline), an intraoral approach was done. Then an incision along the right external oblique line was performed, the periosteum was elevated, and the bone was drilled until the lesion was exposed; therefore the lesion was removed after blunt dissection ().\nThe perilesional curettage after the total removal of the tumor was performed.\nDuring this procedure, trauma to the inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve was avoided.\nThe histopathological diagnosis of the lesion was fibrolipoma ().\nThere was no evidence of recurrence at a 1-year follow-up."
"Our first case is a 25-year-old woman of Hispanic descent, with one previous miscarriage (gravida (G)2, para (P)0). The patient was severely obese with a body mass index of 39 kg/m2. She had a history of a transient ischaemic attack, suspected antiphospholipid syndrome and mitral valvuloplasty for mitral regurgitation due to non-bacterial endocarditis. She was referred to the cardiologist for pre-pregnancy counselling. When she was pregnant, her vitamin K antagonist was replaced by acetylsalicylic acid and a full dose of low-molecular-weight heparin during pregnancy until the fifth day post-partum. At 27 weeks of gestation, she presented with complaints of upper abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia complicated by haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet (HELLP) syndrome (alanine aminotransferase: 143 U/l, thrombocytes: 128 × 109/l). Foetal ultrasonography showed normal growth and the foetal condition judged by cardiotocography was well. The patient was treated with labetalol and magnesium sulphate (MgSO4). At 29 + 3 weeks of gestation, her condition worsened, and a caesarean section was performed. She delivered a baby girl of 1067 g (50th percentile) with an Apgar score of 6 at 5 min. The neonate had to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit because of prematurity. Three days post-partum, the mother presented with syncope. Chest pain was not reported. Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring showed ST-segment depression and Q waves, suggesting inferolateral AMI, which was confirmed by elevated troponin T (5.96 μg/l; normal: < 0.014 μg/l). Her coronary angiogram showed no abnormalities. The AMI was presumably caused by a thrombus, embolism or coronary spasm. Both mother and neonate survived. Her medication was upgraded to a beta-blocker, angiotensine I converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, acetylsalicylic acid and vitamin K antagonist. Echocardiography at 6 months showed a mildly reduced left ventricular function. The diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome was confirmed."
"Patient 1 (Fig. 1):\nA 25-year-old woman, with no past medical history was referred to our tertiary care hospital following diagnosis of an abdominal cystic lesion in her male fetus. Her previous ultrasound (US) performed at 22 weeks gestation was normal. The US realized at 31st week of pregnancy showed an isolated anechoic cyst of 43x21mm, on the inferior part of liver. MRI confirmed the liver cyst. Spontaneous delivery occurred at 37 weeks. Postnatal US and CT (computed tomography) showed ascites due to rupture of the cyst. Spontaneous resolution during the first month of life was good with normal clinical findings, but at the age of six weeks, the baby presented with signs of acute abdomen (pain, ascites) requiring emergency percutaneous aspiration followed by surgery because of cyst recurrence. Laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis of a NBIC in segment IV and marsupialization was performed."
"A 1350-g male child of 32 weeks gestation age was born to a 25-year-old mother by spontaneously vaginal delivery. Apgar scores were 6 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. He did not require artificial ventilation support. The post-natal period was uneventful till day 8, and enteral feeding had been started successfully. On the 8th day of life, he presented with a distended abdomen but soft and lax, without any redness of abdominal wall. Although he had bowel sounds in this process, but stool was not passed. Abdominal X-rays showed distended intestinal loops and a marked pneumoperitoneum bilaterally. Clinical diagnosis of perforation peritonitis was done at this instance and his enteral feeding was stopped along with insertion of NG tube. Biochemical examinations were normal. Total parenteral nutrition and antibiotics were started. Exploratory laparotomy revealed meconium peritonitis and a focal perforation on the 1/3 distal part of sigmoid colon (0.5x0.5 cm, the size of perforation range) (Fig. 1). Full-thickness rectal biopsy on frozen section examination was reported to have normal ganglion cells. The colon size was normal. Margins of the perforation were freshed and closed primarily. Histopathological examination of the margins of perforation was normal. The patient recovered promptly. He is doing fine on follow-up."
"Patient is a 25-year-old woman from Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, and was admitted with an 18-month history of dorsal back pain, asthenia, and significant weight loss followed in the last 8 months by loss of the ability to walk.\nOn her physical examination she presented with three skin lesions (two ulcerated and one nodular) involving the right subclavicle region and other two lesions on her left thigh (one ulcerated and the other in a healing phase) (Figures and ); her neurological exams exhibited an ASIA A paraplegia with a sensory level at D4. Patient was anaemic with hemoglobin of 11,2 g/dL with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 75 mm/h and a C-reactive protein of 5,26 mg/dL. Gamma globulin level was 44 g/dL and blood chemistry evaluation was normal. HIV and primary immunodeficiency testing were negative. A chest X-ray revealed an enlarged mediastinal shadow (), and the spinal computed tomographic scan showed a large anterior and paravertebral abscess from D1 to D10 with significant compression and osteolytic lesions of vertebral bodies with a kyphotic deformity (). Spinal magnetic resonance revealed significant compression of the spinal cord at the kyphotic apex and angulation of the column, anterior and paravertebral epidural abscess consistent with spondylodiscitis ().\nBone biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation with few acid-fast bacilli. Skin biopsy of the lesions () revealed acanthosis and pseudoepitheliomatous, hyperplasia of the epidermis, and necrosis foci surrounded by a histiocytic and lymphocyte infiltrate with giant cells on the dermis, consistent with tuberculosis with negative Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The patient was started on quadruple antituberculosis drug regimen together with pyridoxine and steroids, with a progressive clinical improvement, including healing of the skin lesions. One month later, anterior surgical debridement and posterior arthrodesis of the spine were performed. Blood and urine cultures including cultures for mycobacteria all proved negative. Cultures of the material collected through bone biopsy revealed M. tuberculosis. The patient fulfilled 15 months on antituberculosis medication and a favorable outcome was reported with complete recovery of neurological deficits."
"A 25-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, was referred at 28 weeks of gestation due to sonographic detection of fetal hydrocephaly at 25 weeks. Her family and medical histories were unremarkable and her previous pregnancy resulted in a term delivery of a healthy male. Upon consultation, ultrasound examination confirmed a male infant with bilateral dilatation of the cerebral posterior horns of 32 mm, consistent with severe hydrocephaly (). Further examination with 3D ultrasound revealed fixed adduction of the thumbs (). With parental consent, cordocentesis was performed for cytogenetic and molecular analyses. Maternal blood was also sent for molecular genetic analysis. Direct sequencing on genomic DNA of the 28 exons of the L1CAM gene in maternal and fetal samples was positive for a novel nonsense mutation (c.3241C>T, p.Gln1081X) in exon 24 of the L1CAM gene. At 38 weeks, a 3,285 g male infant with hydrocephaly and bilateral adduction of the thumbs () was delivered by cesarean section. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted on day 10. The infant is currently 3 years of age; he had not reached minimal neurodevelopmental milestones and is under intensive rehabilitation."
A 25-year-old female patient reported to Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with complaint of decay in tooth in upper left back region. Intraoral examination revealed bilateral presentation of paramolars in maxilla between first and second molars on buccal aspect. Examination of right paramolar revealed vertically oriented tooth with small molariform crown. Left side paramolar was also vertically oriented with caries involving the mesioproximal aspect () and the tooth was tender on percussion. Surrounding soft tissue was inflamed. Patient's medical and family histories were not significant and she did not have syndromic features.\nRadiographic examination by occlusal and panoramic view showed horizontal bone loss between left paramolar and first molar with caries involving the pulp of paramolar (). Management approach consisted of extraction of the left paramolar as caries was involving the pulp of paramolar and it was compromising the adjacent periodontal health. The other paramolar was asymptomatic and it was kept under observation as patient was not willing for its treatment. Extracted left paramolar showed caries on its proximal surface with incomplete root formation ().
"A 25-year-old male came with complaints of pain in both groins for 1 month. Pain was more in the left groin compared to the right side. He is mason by occupation and his work involves lifting heavy objects such as stones but does not involve walking long distances. The weight of the stone was 10–15 kg and he had to lift the stones at least 3 to 4 hours a day amounting to a total of 100 to 150 stones. The pain was dull aching in nature, continuous, and nonradiating. Pain was aggravated on standing and walking. Patient was able to do all his routine activities but with pain. He was able to squat, sit, and walk. There was no history of any other comorbidities and past history and social history were not significant.\nOn clinical examination patient had an antalgic gait and there was no limb length discrepancy. There was tenderness present over the anterior joint line of both hip joints bilaterally. Extremes of rotation were painful with internal rotation being more severe. Power in both lower limbs was normal and neurovascular examination was normal.\nThe patient was evaluated by X-ray of both hip joints which showed a possible fracture line in the femoral neck on the left and no abnormality on the right (). On further investigation with MRI scan, a complete fracture line in the femur neck on the left side and an incomplete fracture line on the right side were seen (Figures , , and ). Patient was admitted, immobilised, and evaluated for the stress fracture with blood tests and DEXA scan. The tests revealed a normal blood picture and no abnormality was seen on tests done to rule out metabolic disorders. DEXA scan of lumbar spine also showed a normal T score.\nThe patient underwent surgery with internal fixation done using a 3 holed dynamic hip screw bilaterally on two sittings 2 days apart (). Weight bearing was initiated one and half months following the surgery with the aid of a walker. At 6 months and one year postoperatively patient was doing all his activities of daily living. On radiographic examination at 6 months and one year the X-ray did not show any evidence of avascular necrosis of the femur head ()."
"Case 1. A 25-year-old woman was referred to our hospital at 31 wks of pregnancy for suspected placenta previa. She had had two uterine curettages for spontaneous abortion. At 36 wks she underwent a bilateral ureteral stent placement for the prevention of intraoperative ureteral injury during a possible emergency Caesarean hysterectomy. On the morning of the elective CS, bilateral catheterization of the internal iliac arteries was performed in an angiography suite, using the Infinix Active DSA system. After the patient's transfer to the operating suite (scenario #1), we confirmed the position of the balloons using Siremobil Compact L C-arm fluoroscopy. After the cesarean delivery, the sleeping infant needed life support by neonatologists in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The placenta was separated. The final histological examination showed no findings of placenta accreta. The mother and infant left the hospital 10 days after the CS, without complications.\nThe fluoroscopy with the Infinix Active DSA system in the angiography suite was performed using the condition of middle mode-12 f/s. The subtotal radiation dose in the angiography suite was 19.7 mGy. After the patient's transfer to the operating suite, the position of the balloons needed to be confirmed by Siemens Siremobil Compact C-arm fluoroscopy. The total fetal radiation dose was 31.6 mGy (). We followed the infant to 4 yrs of age. We detected no congenital defects that could be related to the radiation dose."
"A 25-year-old African American male with no significant past medical or family history of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) presented with VF. Electrocardiography (ECG) strip on arrival demonstrated VF (). In the emergency department, the patient continued to have VF refractory to several antiarrhythmic agents, including amiodarone, esmolol, and lidocaine used alone or in combination. Physical examination while the patient was temporarily in sinus rhythm showed an obese afebrile male with no chest wall trauma and normal cardiac and pulmonary examination. Initial ECG demonstrated interventricular conduction delay with nonspecific ST-T wave changes as well as early repolarization pattern (ER) with QRS notching (). Laboratory abnormalities included low magnesium (1.6 mg/dL) and potassium (3.3 mmol/L) levels, which were adequately replaced. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 60–65% with normal wall motion, normal valvular function, and otherwise normal structure. The patient continued to have innumerable episodes of VF requiring a total of 63 shocks. Upon infusion of the beta-agonist ISP, an ECG performed during a temporary sinus rhythm showed a right bundle branch block morphology with a coved ST segment and negative T wave deflections in leads V1 and V2 (). Urine drug screen was negative. The patient was continued on ISP at rate of 0.5 mcg/min. Once the patient status stabilized, ISP was weaned off and he was transitioned to oral quinidine gluconate 324 mg every 8 hours. No further arrhythmias occurred. The ECG on discharge showed near normalization of the ER pattern with resolution of the QRS notching and no J point elevation (). The patient underwent further comprehensive testing including a coronary angiography, which demonstrated normal coronary arteries. Magnetic Resonance Imaging with and without gadolinium enhancement showed no myocardial scarring, inflammation, or infiltration, with a preserved EF of 62%. A diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS) was established based on the characteristic ECG pattern in conjunction with documented VF. Prior to discharge, the patient received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention in conjunction with oral quinidine 324 mg every 8 hours for VF suppression. He has been free of arrhythmias for 7 months."
"Our patient was a 25-year-old Caucasian Iranian man who was referred to our center in 2010 for further evaluation of paraparesis and urinary incontinence. There was no significant point in his past medical or familial medical history. He was well until 2008, when he developed blurred vision in his right eye and was admitted to a local center with the clinical impression of optic neuritis. He received intravenous methylprednisolone 1000mg for 5 days without a good response. Two months later he experienced optic neuritis in his left eye, but he had a good recovery after receiving intravenous methylprednisolone. According to his medical records, his physical examination was normal at that time, with the exception of mild optic atrophy of the right eye. Brain MRI was performed, which revealed some hyperintense T2-weighted lesions around the ventricles, with linear callosal involvement. The lesion was nicely enhanced in a linear pattern in a T1-weighted image with contrast agent (Figs. and ). Linear enhancement of ventricular surfaces (pencil-thin appearance) in both the frontal and occipital horns was another important finding in this patient.\nThe patient was diagnosed with MS and received interferon (IFN) beta 1a three times per week. Six months later he developed another episode of optic neuritis in his left eye, and he had a less than 50 % recovery with intravenous steroids and plasmapheresis. After 1 year, he developed paraparesis and urinary incontinence while receiving IFN beta 1a three times per week. He was admitted to a local hospital and received intravenous methylprednisolone 1000mg/day for 5 days. He responded to this therapy and was able to walk in 4 weeks. At that stage, the patient was referred to our center to escalate the disease-modifying therapy.\nA neurologic examination of the patient revealed bilateral optic atrophy, weakness of both lower limbs (grade 4/5) and bilateral Babinski sign. Although we did not perform detailed neuropsychological tests, the patient did not show any apparent decrease in cognition or any other signs or symptoms of callosal involvement. New MRI showed a longitudinal cord lesion extending more than four vertebral segments without any enhancement. Regarding episodes of optic neuritis, longitudinal extensive spinal cord lesion and atypical callosal involvement, anti-AQP4 was checked, and the result was positive. Other laboratory tests, such as anti-nuclear antibody and anti-phospholipid antibody, for collagen vascular diseases were negative. The patient was diagnosed with NMO, and azathioprine was started for him at a dose of 50mg/day with a gradual increase to 150mg/day."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented to our clinic with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The thyroid gland was not palpable.\nBiochemical Analysis. An autoimmune hyperthyroidism is diagnosed in this case with suppressed TSH = 0.006 uIU/mL and elevated FT4 = 3.45 ng/dL and FT3 = 11.2 pg/mL, antithyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO Ab = 477 IU/mL), and thyrotropin receptor antibody (TR Ab = 46.3 IU/L) levels.\nUltrasonography. The right lobe (23 × 27 × 48 mm in size) has heterogeneous parenchyma with some hypo-echoic areas in forms of patches (diffuse hyperplasia). The left lobe of the gland is not visualised (agenesis).\nThyroid Nuclear Scan with Tc 99m Pertechnetate. The right lobe and the isthmus are hyperplasic in normal localization. Nuclear activity uptake of the gland is diffusely increased. Diffuse hyperplasic thyroid parenchyma may be related with Graves' disease ().\nThe Pathogenesis. This is a young patient who became symptomatic secondary to an autoimmune basis hyperactivity independent of endemic feature of the region. Hemiagenesis was also an incidental finding by imaging methods during evaluation of this patient. The diagnosis was autoimmune toxic diffuse goitre (Graves' disease) in a patient with TH.\nThe patient received preoperatively antithyroid medical treatment with propylthiouracil and propranolol. Antithyroid drugs were used until the operation under control of thyroid function tests.\nSurgery. We determined slightly enlarged homogenous right lobe in the patient. The right lobe and the isthmus are totally excised.\nHistopathology. A thyroid tissue is weighing 27 g after fixation. The size of the right lobe is 90 × 35 × 15 mm. The inner surface is homogenous and rich of colloid. The diagnosis is diffuse hyperplasia.\nOur patients are “unilobate” hemiagenesis cases; therefore, unilateral exploration was performed and the remaining “only” thyroidal tissues are totally excised. Superior and inferior parathyroid glands and also recurrent laryngeal nerves were identified at usual anatomical position at the right side in both patients. They were fully exposed and preserved during thyroid surgery. Postoperative period is uneventful. Both patients are discharged at second postoperative day. They are euthyroid with LT4 (100 μg/day) replacement."
"A 25 year old Sinhalese Sri Lankan female presented with a 1 day history of bilateral lower limb weakness, and numbness with urinary incontinence. She had no back pain and no history of constitutional symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, or recent subjective weight loss.\nOn examination she had atonic lower limbs, with absent muscle power, and absent bilateral lower limb reflexes below knee level, with sensory impairment up to T6 level. She had no spinal deformities or tenderness, and no papilloedema. Upper limb examination was unremarkable except for a hard non tender bony mass on the left scapular region. She had a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 78 beats per minute and had no respiratory compromise.\nShe was investigated with a suspicion of metastatic disease and X-ray of the left shoulder showed a soft tissue and bony mass on the dorsal aspect of the left scapula with multiple lytic lesions suggestive of a primary bone neoplasm (Figure ), but chest radiograph, ultrasound scan of the neck, and Computed tomography (CT) of abdomen were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed an intradural extramedullary mass with an extra spinal component at C7-T2 level causing severe cord compression (Figure ), hence intravenous dexamethasone regimen was started.\nUltrasound guided core needle biopsy from the left scapular mass showed malignant small round blue cell tumour suggestive of Ewing sarcoma. Blood investigations showed Heamoglobin of 9.2 g/dl, white blood cell count of 12 × 103/μl, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)of 150 mm/h, C-reactive protein level of 96 mg/l, normal liver enzyme levels and liver functions tests, and serum alkaline phosphate level of 173 μ/l. Her blood picture showed increased rouleaux formation with anaemia of chronic disease.\nShe had no improvement of symptoms following treatment with dexamethasone. Before implementing on oncological management, 3 days after onset of symptoms, she developed sudden onset progressive ascending neurological impairment with upper limb and bulbar involvement, and unfortunately resulted with respiratory failure and death."
"A healthy 25-year-old female kindergarten teacher with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with severe, debilitating right flank pain after drinking two glasses of wine. Detailed history revealed several years of intermittent abdominal pain often precipitated by alcohol obligating her to exclude beer from her diet. Extensive previous evaluation by gastroenterology, gynecology, and Internal Medicine did not produce a conclusive diagnosis. Prior imaging included an unremarkable pelvic ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound and MRI of the abdomen without hydronephrosis (). Past surgical history was remarkable for an appendectomy several years earlier.\nOn exam, vital signs were within normal limits and abdominal examination was unremarkable. Serum creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL. Urinalysis noted moderate leukocyte esterase, 10–25 WBCs/hpf and 2–5 RBCs/hpf with no bacteria. CT scan of the abdomen during acute pain crisis showed moderate right hydronephrosis with no hydroureter. There was no urolithiasis and renal parenchyma was preserved (). Incidentally noted was a duplicated inferior vena cava distal to the renal veins. On detailed review, there was a lower pole vessel crossing inferior to the point of maximal hydronephrosis. The diagnosis was reviewed with the patient and she was discharged with pain medications and elective surgery was planned.\nSeveral weeks later, the patient underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic right pyeloplasty. A preoperative retrograde pyelogram confirmed a normal caliber ureter and dilated pyelocalyceal system. The “horizontal lie” of the proximal coil of the JJ stent further suggested a crossing vessel (). Intraoperatively, a lower pole vessel was visualized directly overlying the ureteropelvic junction. The ureter was dismembered and transposed anteriorly and a 2 cm stenotic segment of ureter was excised. The renal pelvis and ureter was reanastomosed over the stent anterior to the preserved crossing vessel (). The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was discharged home on postoperative day #1. The stent was removed without incident four weeks after surgery and the patient reported resolution of her symptoms."
"A 25-year-old man developed swelling and pain of the right shoulder after tripping on a step and falling onto his right side. Two weeks later, he was hospitalized with swelling and deformity of the right thigh when crossing the legs. Radiography confirmed a comminuted fracture of the femur secondary to a lytic bone lesion (Fig. ). Chest radiography showed extensive osteolysis of the thoracic bones and several old fractures (Fig. ). His calcium level was 3.59 mmol/L (reference range, 2.08–2.80 mmol/L) and creatinine level was 94 μmol/L (reference range, 45–133 μmol/L). Serum immunoelectrophoresis findings were normal. The levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, alpha-fetoprotein, and carcinoembryonic antigen 2 were normal. The circulating level of PTH was 1399.80 pg/ml (reference range, 15–88 pg/ml), and the diagnosis of PHPT was confirmed. CT of the neck revealed a nodular mass measuring 3.5 × 2.5 × 2.0 cm in the lower right parathyroid gland (Fig. ).\nParathyroidectomy was performed, and the lesion was histologically confirmed to be a benign parathyroid adenoma. The patient recovered well postoperatively, and his serum calcium (2.08 mmol/L) and PTH (65.40 pg/ml) levels normalized within 2 weeks. The patient’s biochemical data before and after parathyroidectomy are shown in Table . Surgical intervention for the pathologic fracture was contraindicated because of serious osteoporosis. Thus, conservative treatment involving fracture reduction and splint fixation was performed. This patient was still being followed up at the time of this writing."
"A 25-year-old woman with a 1½ year history of relapsing-remitting MS presented with a new-onset of scaly and erythematous plaques on the abdomen and lower extremities. Twelve months earlier, she had started treatment with subcutaneous IFN-β 1a (Rebif® 44 µg, thrice weekly). Six month after first administration inflammatory skin reactions appeared at the site of previous subcutaneous injections that subsequently transformed into psoriasiform plaques. Skin lesions spread out onto the lower extremities. There was no personal or family history of psoriasis.\nClinical examination on presentation revealed multiple erythematous plaques distributed over the abdomen and lower extremities (). Scaling plaques covered the elbows. A skin biopsy specimen showed psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. Neutrophilic extravasates were found in the upper epidermis and a perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrate in the papillary dermis with interspersed IL-17-positive cells ().\nDue to the suspicion that psoriasis might have been induced by IFN-β 1a (Rebif® 44 µg) treatment, therapy was discontinued. The psoriatic lesions improved after withdrawal of IFN-β 1a (Rebif® 44 µg) and upon addition of a topical Vitamin D analogue (calcipotriol). Finally, treatment with dimethylfumarate (480 mg daily dose, formula magistralis) was chosen as a therapeutic option for the treatment of both diseases. Treatment was well tolerated with only marginal gastrointestinal problems. After more than twelve months on treatment with fumarates, the patient’s psoriatic lesions completely disappeared and no new neurologic symptoms developed. Finally, her EDSS was 0 and MRI of the brain revealed no further evidence for disease progression."
"A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department with fever and shortness of breath. He had had increasing shortness of breath at rest for the past 2 days associated with multiple episodes of hemoptysis and fever. He also complained of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue for the past 5 days. His past medical history was significant for intravenous drug abuse and a recent soft tissue infection in the distal humeral region of his left arm, which was incised and drained but treated with an incomplete antibiotic course due noncompliance. On admission, he had severe respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min and required a non-rebreathing mask for oxygen supplementation. His initial chest x-ray revealed multifocal bilateral infiltrates and left-side pneumothorax (). A chest tube was placed immediately on the left side.\nHe was admitted to the medical intensive care unit and subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure. Initial lab work showed a white blood cell count of 46 400/µL and a platelet count of 64 000/µL. The patient became hemodynamically unstable and was started on vasopressors and empiric antibiotics. His chest x-ray and computed tomography scan () of the chest revealed patchy airspace consolidation and numerous cavitary infiltrates in both lungs. Blood cultures were positive for Gram-positive cocci in chains and clusters. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe pulmonic regurgitation with thickened leaflets and severe pulmonary hypertension ( and ). A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed vegetations on all the pulmonic valve leaflets, valve perforation, and severe regurgitation (). The patient was started on rifampin and penicillin G.\nCardiothoracic surgery was consulted for pulmonic valve replacement, and the patient’s pulmonary valve and the vegetations were completely removed and replaced with a #25 pericardial valve. This pericardial valve was chosen because it lasts longer in the pulmonary position than either a homograft or a porcine valve. At the end of the procedure, there was no pulmonary valve regurgitation and no perivalvular leak. The overall left ventricular function was preserved. He developed severe coagulopathy during the postoperative period and required multiple units of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate. He was successfully weaned off the ventilator after diuresis. The patient was treated with penicillin G and rifampin for 6 weeks based on culture and susceptibility results; repeat cultures were negative after starting penicillin G and rifampin. Staphylococcus aureus was grown from the valve removed during surgery, and susceptibility tests demonstrated that it was sensitive to penicillin G."
"A 25-year-old nonpregnant woman presented with a two-week history of fever, chills, myalgias, and fatigue. She denied any relevant medical history, including sexually transmitted infections. She reported 6 lifetime male sexual partners with inconsistent condom use. On physical examination, her temperature was 100.2°F and she had an erythematous rash with papules and scaling over the malar region of her face, consistent with eczema herpeticum, . She did not have any predisposing skin conditions for the development of eczema herpeticum, for example, atopic dermatitis. With respect to her serum-antibody status, her HSV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) was positive with a negative immunoglobulin G (IgG). Her serologies for HSV-1 (IgM and IgG) were both negative. Her genital examination consisted of multiple, tender, small ulcerations over her labia and perineum. Her liver function tests were elevated, . Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology was negative. Suspicion for acute necrotizing HSV hepatitis led to the empiric initiation of acyclovir 10 mg/kg intravenous every 8 hours. Viral culture of her genital lesions was positive for HSV-2. Quantitative HSV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of her blood demonstrated 1.1 million copies/mL, which declined to less than 100,000 copies/mL after 5 days of acyclovir therapy. She completed a 7-day course of intravenous acyclovir with good response and a negative follow-up HSV cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCR. Her laboratory findings and physical examination were normal at her 1-month follow-up visit. Seroconversion of her serum-antibody status demonstrated that she acquired a primary infection in that her HSV-2 IgM became negative after treatment and her HSV-2 IgG was positive."
"A 25-year-old white female who presented breast hypotrophy was undergone breast augmentation with 400 ml round smooth, moderate profile silicone implants inserted through an inferior periareolar incision. Implants were placed in a retropectoral pocket. After 6 months, she presented for consultation complaining about bottoming down of both implants. A revision surgery of both breasts was performed trough an infra-mammary incision. A capsulectomy of the lower pole associated with a capsuloplasty and capsulorraphy in the area of the inferior pole was done, defining the new inframammary fold. Breast implants were not changed ()."
"A 25 year-old white female who presented breast hypotrophy was undergone breast augmentation with a 400 ml round smooth, ultra high profile silicone implants inserted through infra-mammary incisions. Implants were placed in a retropectoral pocket. After 6 months, she presented for consultation complaining about bottoming down of the left implant and capsular contraction in the right implant. A revision surgery of both breasts was performed with capsulotomy on the right breast and capsulotomy with capsulorraphy on the letf, both in the area of the inferior pole, along the new infra-mammary fold. Breast implants were not changed ()."
"Patient 2 was a 25 years old right handed female. She was an in-patient, underwent cognitive behavioral psychotherapy for 3 weeks before the measurements and was using psychotropic medication (Setralin 150 mg).\nPatient 2 met SCID-I criteria for OCD predominantly with compulsive behavior, and had a low severity of symtomatology according to Y-BOCs. No clinically significant depression or anxiety was detected.\nThe patient’s pre-post clinical results are presented in ."
"A 25-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 4-para 2-aborta 1, at 30 weeks of gestation, was referred to our center for headache and vomiting with elevated liver enzymes. Her past medical history was significant for episodic palpitations and tremor that started shortly following her last delivery two years prior to presentation. In the emergency department, she was found to have an elevated blood pressure of 230/110 mm Hg. Initial work-up demonstrated elevated liver transaminases (AST = 82 U/L; ALT = 230 U/L) and elevated total bilirubin = 2.5 mg/dL with a normal platelet count and serum creatinine concentration. Proteinuria was evident on urine dipstick analysis. Abdominal ultrasound was remarkable for a well-circumscribed perihepatic mass suggestive of hemangioma measuring 7.7 × 4.8 cm, with no gestational abnormalities. Given the clinical findings, the patient was admitted for suspected HELLP syndrome. On admission, the patient was fluid-restricted to 1.5 L of normal saline per day to prevent potential fluid overload. A bolus and a maintenance infusion of magnesium sulphate were administered for seizure prophylaxis, and the patient was continuously monitored for signs and symptoms of magnesium toxicity. Additionally, her elevated blood pressure was managed by repeated oral doses of nifedipine 10 mg, methyldopa 2 g daily, and continuous infusion of nitroglycerin. The following day, the patient was still symptomatic with uncontrollably elevated blood pressure despite optimization of her antihypertensive therapy. Her hemoglobin concentration dropped and her liver function tests increased further, but her platelet count remained within normal limit. Twenty-four-hour urine collection demonstrated marked proteinuria of 400 mg/dL and confirmed the diagnosis of partial HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome.\nThe patient underwent urgent cesarean section, and general anesthesia was provided due to urgency and inadequacy of regional block. Following successful delivery of a viable baby, the patient's intraoperative course was complicated by an episode of ventricular fibrillation, during which the patient was successfully resuscitated. Postpartum, the patient's symptoms did not improve, and work-up for secondary hypertension was performed. Elevated urinary concentrations of vanillylmandelic acid, metanephrine, and normetanephrine with the presence of a well-circumscribed right adrenal mass measuring 7.5 × 5.6 × 4.2 cm on abdominal MRI confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The patient was stabilized with alpha-blockade followed by beta-blockade, and adrenalectomy was then performed 15 days postpartum. At discharge, the patient's signs and symptoms resolved, and her lab tests normalized."
"Patient 1 (Table ) was a 25-year-old female implanted with the titanium abutment 2 years previously. The abutment was placed using the recommended surgical procedure at the time, which was a linear incision with soft tissue thinning (). Her history of disease included constitutional eczema and otitis externa. She had recurring and persistent episodes of peri-abutment dermatitis, which were clinically unrelated to the constitutional eczema. The inflammation was unresponsive to topical and systemic antibiotics (classified as a Holgers grade 4). This eventually led to the decision to remove the abutment. At the time of removal, the inflammation was moderate (classified as a Holgers grade 2 reaction) for which she was being treated with a topical ointment (Nasumel ®, Bfactory Health Products B.V. Rhenen, The Netherlands). At that point in time, the soft tissue thickness was approximately 4 mm. The abutment was removed under local anesthesia by unscrewing its internal screw that mounts it to the osseointegrated implant fixture. The abutment was not attached to the surrounding soft tissue. A thin layer of surrounding tissue was excised using a scalpel."
"A 25 year-old woman presented with seizure, psychiatric symptoms and behavioral change for 2 weeks. About 5 weeks before her first symptom, she underwent a resection of nevi on her nose in a local hospital, of which the pathological diagnosis is compound nevus confirmed by the dermatologist. Her family history was unremarkable. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed normal while the electroencephalogram (EEG) indicated electrographic seizures. For her lumbar puncture, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) count was 2/μL; the CSF protein concentration, 54 mg/dl. The CSF-specific oligoclonal bands were weak positive. The serum and CSF samples were tested for the antibodies to cell-surface antigens including NMDAR, leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1), contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), γ-amino-butyric acid-B receptor (GABABR) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-iso-xazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR), using a commercial assay (Catalogue No. FA 112d-1003-1, EUROIMMUN AG, Lübeck, Germany). Anti-NMDAR antibodies were all positive in the CSF and serum. Screening with an ultrasonographic examination of her ovaries and a computed tomographic scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of tumors. She received methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 g per day for 5 days. Steroids were tapered down gradually as her symptoms relieved. Mycophenolate mofetil was added as the continued immunotherapy. The follow-up is still going on."
"A girl in her 20s was admitted to our hospital with psychosis, behavioral change and complex partial seizure over a period of 5 months. A resection of nevus on her forehead was performed about 2 weeks before her admission, which was intradermal nevus on the histopathology. The brain MRI was unremarkable and the EEG demonstrated generalized slow activity. The CSF analysis revealed the WBC count was 66/μL with 99 lymphocytes and 1 % monocytes, and the protein concentration level was 72 mg/dL. The same tests with serum and CSF for available antibodies to cell-surface antigens were performed as previously described. High titres of anti-NMDAR antibodies were both detected in the CSF and serum. The screening tests for an ovarian teratoma and other tumors were all negative. She received one course of intravenous immunoglobulin, 2 g/kg, divided into 5 days, followed with intravenous methylprednisolone at an initial dosage of 80 mg per day. Gradually, her psychotic symptoms resolved and she was able to follow simple commands and talk to her parents. The test for NMDAR antibody in CSF became negative afterwards while that in serum remained positive."
"A 25-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with persistent fever and nonproductive cough of two-week duration. His symptoms were initially treated as an outpatient one week prior to presentation with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid due to concern for pneumonia; however, his symptoms progressively worsened. Upon presentation, his initial vital signs were as follows: T: 100.8, P: 108, BP: 120/73, RR: 20, and oxygen saturation: 95% on room air. Within 24 hours he developed increased oxygen requirements requiring three liters of supplemental oxygen, orthopnea, and voluminous blood-tinged, frothy sputum. Physical examination was remarkable for mild respiratory distress and diminished heart and lung sounds. Initial basic metabolic panel and complete blood count were normal. NTproBNP was elevated at 513, troponin-t was elevated at 0.04, and inflammatory markers were elevated (ESR 55, CRP 13.4). Respiratory viral reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive only for hMPV using a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest X-ray showed new cardiomegaly and bilateral opacities, as compared to a normal chest X-ray 6 months earlier, suggesting pulmonary edema. Our differential diagnosis at this point included acute heart failure, pulmonary infection, and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. Pulmonary medicine was consulted and a computed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrated bilateral opacities. Echocardiogram demonstrated a severely depressed ejection fraction of 25% with severely enlarged left atrial volume and severely dilated left ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed septal wall enhancement compatible with myocarditis (). The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit and started on intravenous diuretics and afterload and preload reducing agents (furosemide 80 mg IV BID, captopril 3.125 mg TID, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg BID, and isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg TID). Over the course of seven days the patient improved. He was net negative eight liters from admission and was discharged home on lisinopril 5 mg and metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.\nOn hospital day 4, the national reference laboratory's report of respiratory pathogen testing of a nasal swab collected on admission was positive for hMPV but negative for pathogens most commonly causing pulmonary infection, including influenza A and influenza B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, tuberculosis, and mycoplasma."
"A 25-year-old white woman was referred to the Gastrointestinal Unit of the University of Salerno for severe constipation. After having already followed a long treatment with Movicol (macrogol; Norgine Ltd, Hengoed, UK) with no resolution to her constipation, she underwent a rigorous assessment process to exclude any organic diseases, including proctosigmoidoscopy as well as laboratory tests. No abnormalities were found and she fulfilled Rome III criteria for functional constipation. Further diagnostic tools were then planned to better classify her functional constipation including a colonic transit time and an anorectal manometry with a balloon expulsion test, which indeed showed slow transit time constipation. During the routine physical examination, an abnormality of her teeth was perceived and a dental evaluation was requested (Fig. ).\nThe dentist diagnosed dental erosion of the maxillary anterior teeth, in particular the lingual and incisal surfaces (Fig. ). Then, he asked the patient about any previous episodes of recurrent vomiting, of any eating habits such as Coke-swishing or vegetable and/or fruit-mulling; however, her answer was negative. In consequence, the dentist had a meeting with gastroenterologists and the suspicion of an ED was raised. At the second more careful gastroenterological assessment, the patient also tested positive for FD, specifically PPDS. Therefore, the suspicion of an ED became even stronger, and a psychiatric evaluation was planned reaching the final diagnosis of AN, which required psychiatric treatment."
"A 25-year-old gentleman presented to the orthopaedic clinic with a three-year history of recurrent patella instability and dislocation in the stump of a BK amputation. The BK amputation was performed in infancy for congenital longitudinal limb deficiency, and the patient had previously experienced excellent mobility with a patella-tendon bearing prosthesis. However, now he reported patella dislocation on an almost bimonthly basis, each time leaving him with pain and swelling that would prevent him from using his prosthesis altogether. Often he would experience so much pain and apprehension that he would not be able to weight-bear on his prosthesis.\nOn examination he had a well-formed below-knee amputation with a mature stump. Range of motion of the knee was 0–90 degrees with obvious patellar maltracking and moderate quadriceps wasting. Patella apprehension testing was strongly positive.\nRadiographs confirmed arthritic changes in the lateral compartment and relative patella alta with an Insall-Salvati ratio of 0.8 calculated according to the original description [] (). Despite having lateral femoral condyle hypoplasia and what initially would appear as distal femoral valgus, the anatomical lateral distal femoral angle measured 88 degrees, which in theory should not encourage patella dislocation. MRI showed severe trochlear dysplasia (Dejour type C) [] and a laterally displaced and tilted patella (). Tibial tuberosity to trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance was 13 mm (within acceptable limits), as measured from MRI. MRI also demonstrated rupture of the MPFL and chondral loss from the medial patellar facet consistent with previous dislocation.\nFollowing a course of failed conservative management with physiotherapy, bracing, and alterations to his prosthesis, the patient elected to undergo MPFL reconstruction. Preoperative MRI showed that the hamstring tendons on the ipsilateral side were atrophied and almost undetectable, and so these were not deemed to be adequate donors. Harvest of ipsilateral quadriceps tendon was not performed for fear of compromising an already compromised limb. The contralateral hamstrings were not harvested as both patient and surgeon did not want to risk any potential complication or weakness in the only functional leg available. As we have easy access to tendon allograft, a semitendinosus allograft was chosen and ordered to reconstruct the MPFL."
"A 25-year-old woman with a palpable lump in her right breast was referred to our department. She had been diagnosed with NF1 at the age of 17 years. Two of her aunts had cancer; one had breast cancer and the other had ovarian cancer. However, there was no family history of neurofibromatosis.\nOn US, an ill-defined hypoechoic mass with microcalcifications and irregular duct changes, extending to the subareolar area, was noted in her right breast. Additionally, several lesions believed to be metastatic lymph nodes were observed in the ipsilateral axilla (Figures and ). On mammography (MMG), fine pleomorphic microcalcifications with segmental distribution were noted in the lower outer portion of her right breast (). On MRI, the lesion showed about 6.5 cm sized, nonmass enhancement lesion with heterogeneous internal enhancement pattern and occupied most of the right breast, except the lower inner portion ().\nShe underwent US-guided core needle biopsy in the lower outer portion of her right breast and of the pathological lymph nodes in the right axilla. She was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast and metastatic lymphadenopathy in the right axilla. She underwent modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, and the final diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma with axillary metastasis (T2N3M0; estrogen receptor positive; progesterone receptor positive; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative; Ki-67 10–20%). We analyzed DNA from peripheral blood in order to evaluate the presence of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Specific coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequence alterations were confirmed at the genomic level with PCR amplification, and no mutation was noted in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. She received postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Presently, she is being regularly followed up, and she has not shown any signs of disease recurrence."
"A male infant was born to a 25-year-old gravida 2, para 2, mother via cesarean section at term. Labor and delivery were uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The parents were not relatives, and the family history was unremarkable. They had a healthy, five-year-old girl. In their family there was no history of skin, connective tissue, or autoimmune disease.\nHe had normal weight, length, head circumference, and vital signs. On physical examination, he was found to have absence of skin over the anteromedial aspect of both lower legs, starting from the knees and extending to dorsal and medial plantar aspect of the feet. The lesions have sharply demarcated borders covered by a red ultrathin translucent membrane (). On the second day, he developed blisters on the upper lip mucous membranes and on the left wrist (). Results of his complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, electrolytes, ionized calcium, and magnesium were within normal limits. Serologic tests for TORCH were negative. Ophthalmological examination, abdominal and cranial ultrasound screening, and echocardiography revealed normal findings. Histopathological examination of the left wrist lesion demonstrated full or partial developed subepithelial vesicle formation (). Direct immunofluorescent staining showed weak focal perivascular deposition of IgM, IgA, C3, and Fibrinogen but did not demonstrate IgG, C4, and C1q depositions that have suggested dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. The combination of aplasia cutis congenital (ACC) and EB led to the diagnosis of Bart's Syndrome.\nPatient was referred to dermatology. Physician recommended to allow the area to heal spontaneously by using conservative wound care such as topical antibacterial ointment and wet gauze dressing two to three times a day. The patient was treated by applying topical mupirocin (Bactroban) and wet gauze dressing (Bactigras) for 4 weeks and skin lesions had recovered substantially with appropriate therapy. The infant was discharged on the tenth day of hospital stay to continue local wound care by his mother."
"A 25-year-old man was referred after excision of a painful 2-cm nodule in the left infrapatellar region. Pathological diagnosis was synovial sarcoma (Fig. a). Because of positive margin, pre-operative radiotherapy and subsequent re-excision were performed. The whole patellar tendon, infrapatellar fat pad, inferior one-third of the patella, and the tibial tuberosity were removed together with 6 × 12 cm of the skin including previous operation scar. Using an oblique osteotomy, nearly the whole original patellar-femoral joint surface of the patella was preserved. Following resection, BPTB allograft was harvested and shaved to fit the osteotomy sites. Then, the allograft was fixed to the residual patella and proximal tibia with screws and a stainless steel Dall-Miles 2-mm Cable and Sleeve Set (Stryker Australia Pty., Ltd.) tightened at 30° knee flexion (Fig. b). The soft tissue defect was covered with a free ipsilateral antero-lateral thigh (ALT) flap.\nPost-operative course was uneventful without wound complication or infection. The operated knee was kept straight in splint for the first 3 months, and then gentle passive and active range-of-motion (ROM) exercise was started. Full weight bearing (FWB) was tolerated immediately after surgery but only in the setting of using crutches for the first 6 weeks. Three months after surgery, progressive ROM exercise and FWB without splint were allowed. Both bone–bone junctions were united 11 months post-operatively (Fig. c). After both bone–bone junctions were united, sports activity, including fun skiing, was permitted. At 67 months after surgery, the patient was continuously free of disease. His left knee function was virtually normal, with no extension lag and knee flexion of 130° (Fig. ; Additional file : Movie S1). Quadriceps manual muscle test was 5/5. Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score was 30/30 (Enneking et al. )."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Institute of Dental Sciences, Bhubaneswar, with a chief complaint of bleeding and pain in gums in the mandibular anterior region two weeks back. He admitted to have been scratching in the same region frequently with his fingernails on having sensitivity and irritation () which gave him a temporary relief. Occasionally, he used a matchstick in the same area till bleeding occurred and he felt relieved. On asking he revealed that he had lost his job four months back and was quite disturbed for the same reason. He further confided that he was feeling low and was depressed. Physically, he appeared emaciated and weak. His medical history was noncontributory and he was not currently under any medications.\nIntraoral examination revealed erythematous gingiva in the area of chief complaint which bled profusely on probing. Also, it was partially detached with an irregular border giving a cleft-like appearance extending beyond the mucogingival junction in relation to mandibular right central incisor. He maintained poor oral hygiene with evidence of extrinsic stains, plaque, and calculus. No other pathological changes were seen in the oral cavity. He was then referred to the Department of Psychiatry, IMS and SUM Hospital, Bhubaneswar, where his SIB was confirmed. Therefore, a diagnosis of gingivitis artefacta major was made based on his history and clinical findings.\nThe patient was presented with, and accepted, a treatment plan which included periodontal and behavior management. A written informed consent was obtained. Periodontal treatment included scaling and root planing (SRP) with instructions for maintenance of oral hygiene. The patient was asked to trim his fingernail and to refrain from scratching or picking in the concerned area. He was prescribed 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate containing mouthwash (Hexidine, ICPA Health Products Limited, Ankleshwar, India) to be used twice daily for a week. A local anesthetic gel containing 20% Benzocaine (Mucopain, ICPA Health Products Limited, Ankleshwar, India) was prescribed for symptomatic relief to be applied on the affected area for 1 week.\nFor behavioral management, he was put under cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a trained therapist in the Department of Psychiatry, IMS and SUM Hospital, Bhubaneswar. His therapy continued for 4 weeks with regular sessions. Following this he reported back for reevaluation. He was able to completely stop the SIB and there was a noticeable change in his gingival health with maintenance of fair oral hygiene. The residual gingival recession (Miller's Class II) was planned for correction with mucogingival surgery."
"A 25-year-old man was referred to our center because he had been involved in an accident between a motorcycle and a car, and he had sustained open injuries to both lower extremities, and ischemia had increased over a 10-hour period in the right extremity. When he was admitted, the patient had hemorrhagic shock, which was indicated by his restlessness, shortness of breath, cold limbs, blood pressure of 40/65 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats/min, hematocrit level of 32.9%, and hemoglobin concentration of 8.7 g/dL. Correcting the shock and stabilizing the vital signs were the first steps in the patient’s treatment. During the surgical exploration, we found that the patient had sustained very serious damage to the right limb, which was classified as Gustilo IIIC, and the patient had a MESS of 8 points. Furthermore, the tibiofibular fracture was comminuted, the posterior tibial artery had contusions and thromboses that were too extensive to repair, the anterior artery had a defect that was longer than 10 cm, and the peroneal artery had not been spared and it contained a defect that was 5-cm long (). The injuries to the left limb are not considered here. The far-end peroneal artery was bridged to the popliteal artery bifurcation using RSVG, and the near-end peroneal artery was anastomosed with the distal tibial artery (). The limb was stabilized with a cross-knee external fixator, and, eventually, the blood supply was restored in the limb and the pulse of the dorsalis pedis artery was good. Following a postoperative management and exercise program that was tailored to the patient’s condition, the salvage of the limb was deemed successful, and the Fugl-Meyer upper-extremity score was 89 points ()."
"A 25 year-old male presented to his urologist with an acute onset of urinary frequency and nocturnal incontinence of 2 months duration. Additional symptoms included chronic fatigue and suprapubic and lower abdominal pain. He did not have any associated dysuria or hematuria. He denied notable bruising, bleeding, fevers, or chills, but did experience occasional night sweats.\nThe patient smoked marijuana twice daily and was a former tobacco smoker. He had an unremarkable past medical history, and a family history significant for two uncles diagnosed with lymphoma.\nPhysical exam was significant for a large mass extending from the anterior midline to the left costovertebral angle in anterior-posterior dimensions, and from the left subcostal margin to the pelvis in length. Manipulation incited suprapubic discomfort. There was no associated lymphadenopathy. His initial complete blood cell count (CBC) showed isolated lymphocytosis of 6.1 × 109/L and thrombocytopenia with platelets of 115 × 109/L. The peripheral blood smear demonstrated rare atypical binucleated lymphocytes. His initial work-up included an abdominal ultrasound (US) and subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis that demonstrated massive splenomegaly approximating 35cm. The lower pole of the spleen was significantly compressing the bladder. A PET scan revealed isolated uptake in the enlarged spleen with an SUV of 6.6. ()\nThese findings prompted a bone marrow biopsy for lymphoma staging that demonstrated binucleated lymphocytes indicative of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder/lymphoma. Flow cytometry, surface markers, and molecular studies of bone marrow lymphocytes did not demonstrate evidence of clonality by either method.\nGiven his progressive symptoms, thrombocytopenia, abdominal discomfort, massive splenomegaly, and concern for splenic lymphoma without definitive pathology, the patient underwent a splenectomy for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes following scheduled meningococcal, pneumococcal, and H. influenza vaccinations. He had an uncomplicated post-operative course with resolution of his fatigue, pain, and urinary continence."
"A 25-year-old African obese woman with a history of two cesarean sections was referred to our clinic with 6 weeks’ delay of menstruation, frequent increasing abdominal pain and 3 days of vaginal bleeding. She had a regular menstrual period before the symptoms. In her medical history there was no record of use of an IUD, endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. This was her third spontaneous pregnancy and there was no abortion. Her general condition was good and her vital signs were normal: blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, pulse 70 beats per minute (bpm), temperature 36.5 °C. A physical examination showed minimal tenderness in all sides of her abdomen with an increase in right lower pelvic section. A speculum examination showed a small amount of cervical bleeding, a palpable mass in rectouterine cavity and increased temperature and tenderness at right adnexial region. Transvaginal ultrasonography (USG) showed empty uterine cavity with 11 mm thickness. However, her rectouterine cavity was observed to be filled with heterogenous liquid including septations and hyperechogenic areas which were thought to be a coagulum. An ectopic gestational sac and yolk sac seemed to be inside her right ovary, and were identified close to the midline, which correlated with her 6 weeks’ delay of menstruation (Fig. ). The fetus and fetal heart beat were not clearly seen. Vascular proliferation called ‘ring of fire’ which is typical for ectopic ovarian pregnancy was detected around the gestational sac (Fig. ). Her left ovary and tubal structures seemed to be normal. She declared her previous menstrual periods were regular but that her last period was 2 months ago. Laboratory analysis showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 11,600/mm3, red blood cell count (RBC) of 400000/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.3 g/dl, hematocrit (Htc) of 36 %, beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) of 6580 and normal urine results. She was diagnosed as having an ectopic ovarian pregnancy and was hospitalized. She and her family were informed about the stability of the condition and in view of her history of two previous cesarean sections, medical treatment of MTX was planned. A single dose of 90 mg intramuscular MTX was administered. She was stable. A progressive decrease in her beta HCG levels (4310 at fourth day, 2190 at seventh day, 210 at 14th day) as well as a diminishing of intraabdominal liquid and significant regression of her right ovarian sac were observed and she was discharged with weekly beta HCG test control advice. At the third week after the MTX treatment her beta HCG level was below 5 and her intraabdominal fluid had nearly disappeared (Fig. )."
"A 25-year-old male with colitis ulcerosa treated with prednisone was transferred to our department with a soft tissue defect at the left neck and upper left thorax after local necrosis following an abscess due to an erroneous puncture of a central line (Figure 2a ). After several debridements, applying vacuum- and antibiotic therapy combined with continuing a low dose prednisone therapy, the wound was vital and microbiologically free of bacteria. As reconstructive surgery, we decided to perform a supraclavicular artery island flap. The postoperative wound healing process showed no signs of infection with only a minor dehiscence at the drainage area so that we could discharge the patient with a good reconstructive result (Figure 2b ).\nHowever, following the necessity of increasing the prednisone therapy due to an acute period of colitis ulcerosa, the patient presented himself again 3 weeks after being discharged with multiple dehiscence around the elevation site of the supraclavicular flap with serous outflow. The microbiological tests showed no evidence of bacteria. After multiple debridements, the secondary wound was covered with skin grafts using MatriDerm® as dermal matrix (Figure 2c, d ). The young, immunocompromised patient could finally be discharged after an overall hospitalization stay of more than 12 weeks."
"Male patient, 25 years old, complaining about the onset of an erythematous lesion\nin the left hip region when he was 13, having progressed with slow increase in\nvolume since then. At the examination, an erythemato-violaceous, infiltrated and\nxerotic plaque was observed in the described region (). After medical consultation with a general\nsurgeon, a cutaneous biopsy was performed. The histopathological examination\nshowed, in the dermal-hypodermic region, a large inflammatory infiltrate\ncomposed mainly of layers of rounded mononuclear histiocytic cells with\neosinophilic cytoplasm associated with many multinucleated cells with signs of\nemperipolesis, besides lymphocitary elements without atypia. He was diagnosed\nwith GCT-ST, with compromised surgical margins.\nMagnetic resonance of skin and hip performed in the post-operative period revealed\na 20-centimeter area of subcutaneous tissue infiltration, without involvement of\nmuscles or bones. A new approach was necessary, with ample excision, followed by\ntissue grafting.\nHistopathological diagnosis of GSS was then carried out in the new specimen, based\non the presence of features already described, associated with extensive,\npredominantly deep infiltration of lymphocytes, and a CD4 + epidermotropic\nlymphoid infiltrate on the surface ( and ). Orcein staining\nrevealed the absence of subcutaneous elastic fibers, as well as in deep dermis.\nResearch for T-cell clonality was positive."
"Female patient, 25 years old, from the state of São Paulo.\nWhen she was ten months old, her mother who brought her to our clinic reporting\nthat the child had had absence of hair, eyelashes and eyebrows since birth. An\nanatomopathological examination performed on the scalp revealed alopecia. One\nyear later she presented desquamative lesions on her fingertips and dystrophic\nfingernails. At two years and six months of age, hyperkeratotic and desquamative\nplaques appeared on her palms.\nAt eight years of age the patient presented a clinical picture of total alopecia\nand nail dystrophy. Hyperkeratotic plaques, initially present on her palms,\ninvolved the soles of feet as well (). Besides, she presented a distal tapering of fingers, which at\nradiological examination showed reduction of soft tissues in distal extremities\nof fingers, acquiring a triangular configuration, and bone structures of normal\nappearance (). A biopsy was done\nwhich revealed absence of hair follicles, but sweat glands with normal features.\nThe patient did not present changes in sudoresis, dentition or hearing.\nWhen she was 14 years old, after being evaluated by a psychologist, emotional\ndamage was observed and depression secondary to the pathology was diagnosed.\nMoreover, learning difficulties were noticed and light mental retardation\ndiagnosed. At the time, the patient wore a hairpiece and presented remission of\npalmoplantar keratoderma after the introduction of topical keratolytics.\nPatient treatment continued with multidisciplinary follow-up (dermatology,\npsychology and genetics). The same patient has two children which were not\naffected by the syndrome and are healthy. The patient's parents are\nphenotypically normal with no consanguinity. Genetic study did not reveal\nsimilar cases in the family. Currently at 25 years of age, the patient is\nperiodically monitored and deals with her pathology in a very conscious way,\ncontinuing with the treatment for palmoplantar keratoderma ()."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with complaints of progressively worsening abdominal pain for the past 3 days, occurring on the background of fatigue and weight loss for the past 8 months.\nThe abdominal pain was continuous and severe in intensity and associated with multiple episodes of bilious vomiting, abdominal distention, and obstipation. On examination, the patient appeared to be confused and cachectic and was febrile (101°F), hypotensive (80/50 mmHg), and tachycardic (110 bpm). His abdomen was diffusely tender with board-like rigidity, while digital rectal examination (DRE) was unremarkable. His hematologic investigations revealed low hemoglobin (9 g/dL) and TLC of 15.4 × 106. His electrolytes were within normal limits, but his serum albumin was 1.6 g/L. An erect chest X-ray showed free air under diaphragm ().\nAfter initial assessment a diagnosis of generalized peritonitis secondary to hollow viscus perforation was made. He underwent emergency laparotomy, with intraoperative findings of multiple small bowel perforations, starting 10–15 cm from duodenojejunal (DJ) junction, extending up to the terminal ileum (). On closer examination, each diseased site had a confluence of pinpoint perforations ().\nSince the patient was hemodynamically unstable and severely wasted, such an extensive small bowel resection was not an option due to the high intraoperative and postoperative mortality risk. Therefore, a more conservative approach was selected. The perforations were primarily closed by Lambert sutures, using Vicryl 2-0 (), while the perforations at the terminal ileum were resected and two ends were brought out as double-barreled ostomy.\nHe was subsequently started on antituberculous therapy based on clinical suspicion, and parenteral nutrition was also initiated. The histopathologic examination of the resected bowel specimen and the mesenteric lymph nodes was consistent with intestinal tuberculosis. The patient was closely watched for signs and symptoms of postoperative leak; however, he made a slow but progressive recovery and is currently being followed up in the clinics with ultimate plan of ileostomy closure."
"A 25-year-old morbidly obese male underwent bariatric surgery 3 months prior to presentation. In the week preceding his presentation to an outside hospital, he had increased his intake of ondansetron 4 mg tablets up to 40 tablets/day because of intractable nausea and vomiting. He was initially hospitalized for a progressively worsening headache of 1 week duration. Initial computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral cerebral edema in the parietal and occipital lobes in the setting of elevated blood pressure (BP). However, 3 days into his admission, following initial improvement in his blood pressure with oral anti-hypertensive medication, but in the setting of continued use of the ondansetron, he developed sudden onset near complete blindness with inability to count fingers from one foot away but bare light perception. His blood pressure was measured as 190/110. Computed tomography (CT) head imaging revealed similar cerebral edema in the posterior cortex but new intra-parenchymal hemorrhage (Fig. ). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our institution but despite supportive treatment, his condition worsened while CT imaging findings remained unchanged. No angiography was obtained, as it was felt to likely be inconclusive in the setting of massive hemorrhage. A CT venogram demonstrated no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. Invasive intracranial monitoring with a Licox® monitor revealed variable to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) ranging from 10 to 50 mm Hg. The patient was aggressively treated with hyperosmolar therapies and other supportive measures. He stabilized and after a protracted hospitalization was eventually discharged to rehabilitation. At the 12 week follow-up, he was noted to be independent in most of his activities of daily living. He was, however, left with significant visual impairment, leaving him only with the ability to count fingers in central vision, and only detect movement in his right visual fields. Follow-up CT of the head without contrast was obtained at that time, (Fig. ) revealing resolution of the hematomas."
"Patient 2: The patient is a 25 year old male of Indian descent with FRDA (GAA repeats lengths = 650, 850). At age 2, the patient presented with periorbital edema, lethargy, and abdominal swelling. Idiopathic NS was confirmed following urine protein testing. He developed gait difficulties at age 9 and was diagnosed with FRDA at age 10. He had been treated with chronic steroids from age 2 to age 10, with doses ranging from 15 mg every other day to 60 mg per day during episodic flares. In response to the onset of gait problems, the patient’s nephrologist switched him from steroid treatment to 100 mg of cyclophosphamide for 3 months. He has not had any relapses of NS since then. However, the patient’s ataxia worsened after the discontinuation of steroids.\nGiven the improvement of the first subject on corticosteroid treatment, we examined the records of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Collaborative Clinical Research Network (CCRN) for other individuals reporting responses to corticosteroids prescribed for other indications in a retrospective review (Table ) []. Nine people with FRDA experienced improved balance, gait or speech with corticosteroid or other immunomodulatory therapy, and no individuals were identified with significant steroid dependent worsening. One other patient treated with steroids showed improvement, although it is unclear whether improvement was due to corticosteroids or other medications initiated at the same time. All patients besides patients 1 and 2 described had normal kidney function.\nThere are several limitations to this study. Improvement in the context of corticosteroid treatment often occurred in the context of significant clinical changes, such as NS in the case of the two cases presented and surgery or trauma in other FRDA patients treated with steroids. Furthermore, in two cases, steroid treatment was initiated following intravenous immunoglobulin G treatment prescribed for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and Guillain-Barre syndrome, both likely misdiagnoses for Friedreich Ataxia. This raises the possibility that in these cases concomitant intravenous immunoglobulin G treatment was at least partially responsible for noted improvements."
"A 25-year-old man was confirmed to have a left renal tumour during a routine examination, and was admitted to hospital for urological examination. The patient was asymptomatic with a normal appetite, no abdominal pain, no weight changes, and no family history of renal disease. CT imaging revealed a 3.6 cm well-defined, round, heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left kidney. Nephrectomy was performed and a 4.1 cm encapsulated tumour removed. Follow-up at 27 months confirmed no tumour recurrence or metastasis."
"Patient 1 was a 25-year old female diagnosed as UWS for 4 years following a cerebral anoxia sustained in a road-traffic accident. On the day of her EEG evaluation, patient 1 returned a diagnosis of low MCS with a Coma Recovery Scale–Revised (CRS-R) score of 8 (auditory function: localization to sound; visual function: startle; motor function: flexion withdrawal; oromotor/verbal function: oral reflexive movement; communication: none; arousal: eye opening without stimulation)."
"A 25 years old man presented with a laceration on radial side of proximal phalanx of 4th finger (Zone II) which was due to cut with glass. During initial examination the FDS and FDP seemed to be cut. Then patient was admitted for flexor tendon repair.\nDuring surgery the primary wound was extended by Z plasty which flaps was retracted and then we tried to reconstruct the both FDS and FDP as patients was an intern in general medicine and interested in surgery and also was a piano player which made him a high demand case.\nTo find the retracted tendon we tried to find the cut tendons in distal and proximal canals. During try to find tendons, we had to extend the field of surgery. Surprisingly we saw that the proximal parts of FDS and FDP are separated. At first we extended the field more as were suspicious to retraction of the FDP from its normal canal and extruded out of canal at proximal site. But we found that the sheaths of FDP and FDS are not the same and each tendon have separate sheath. The tendons were repaired by Kessler and running sutures. The Klinerth system was applied for the patient and passive flexion with active extension was started from the fifth day after surgery. Patient was followed weekly and the process of rehabilitation was screened. After 23 days the splint was removed and physiotherapy was started. During 15 month after surgery about 30 degrees of extension lag was remained which was not restored."
"A 25-year-old woman visited our hospital because of bilateral pneumothorax detected on a chest X-ray taken during a health screening (Figure ). She had neither chest-related symptoms nor a rash on her body or face. She was a non-smoker and had no history of major diseases. However, she had a family history of spontaneous pneumothorax that included her father, paternal uncle, and paternal aunt.\nA chest computed tomography (CT) scan taken at our hospital showed right-sided pneumothorax as well as almost healed left-sided pneumothorax (Figure ). It also showed multiple cystic lesions throughout both lungs.\nWe performed video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) on the patient's right lung. Repetition of pneumothorax was suspected because pleural adhesion and thick pleura were found in her thorax. Many bullas were found at the surface of the lung; therefore, resection and ablation of bullas were performed, followed by stapling of the staple lines and reinforcement of ablated sites using a polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheet and fibrin glue. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful.\nOne month after the operation, she visited our hospital again complaining of respiratory discomfort. Chest X-ray and CT scan showed left-sided pneumothorax. Therefore, we performed VATS on the left lung. Again, many minuscule bullas appeared throughout the whole lung, and pleural adhesion and thick pleura were observed as before in the right lung. The surgery was performed following the same methods used for the right lung. Again, the patient's post-operative course was uneventful, and the recurrence of pneumothorax was not observed in either lung at 6 months after the second operation.\nHistopathological examination showed that the inner surfaces of cysts were lined with epithelial cells, and the cysts occasionally contained internal septa consisting of alveolar walls (Figure ). There were no special pathological findings of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) or catamenial pneumothorax, including LAM cell clusters or formation of chocolate-like endometriotic cysts.\nBecause the patient was young and a non-smoker with prominent family history of pneumothorax and multiple cystic lesions were observed throughout her whole lung, we suspected congenital disease and particularly BHD, despite the absence of fibrofolliculomas. We presented this case to a special research team focusing on BHD, which was formed as a specialized disease treatment research program by the Japanese government. The patient was diagnosed as having BHD via a DNA analysis, which showed two deletions of bases in exon 12 of the BHD gene (Figure ). No renal tumors were observed by abdominal ultrasonography."
"A 25-year-old female first presented to general physician with nonproductive cough, dull aching chest pain for 10 months with no history of weight loss, and dysphagia. Chest X-ray () showed opacity along right paratracheal region; correlating this feature with her symptom of cough plus high prevalence of pulmonary TB in India, physician empirically started her on AKT (anti-Koch's treatment), but her cough did not regress over next few months. Computed tomography scan (CT) of thorax revealed (Figures , , and ) mass arising along right wall of esophagus in its upper part and showing enhancement, without paraesophageal lymphadenopathy; mass was extending up to right pleural cavity and to left side of esophagus obliquely downward, suggestive of leiomyoma of esophagus. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed which revealed a submucosal protrusion along right side of esophageal wall, without luminal compression and with intact overlying mucosa. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) of esophagus mentioned well-defined hypoechoic lesion arising from esophageal muscular wall suggestive of leiomyoma. Endoscopic biopsy was avoided. Routine laboratory and clinical findings were normal. Based on these findings, the decision was made to proceed with thoracoscopic enucleation after taking informed consent."
"A previously healthy 25-year-old female was brought to the Emergency Department after being found frothing at the mouth, unresponsive, and stiff all over. The patient had been complaining of headache, neck and shoulder pain for 2 days prior and was prescribed ibuprofen, no other history was available.\nOn examination, the patient was conscious and alert but appeared extremely distressed, continuously frothing at the mouth with trismus and tongue protrusion requiring regular suctioning; however, she was able to maintain her airway and all vital signs were within normal limits. She was also tearing and groaning frequently.\nOn neurological examination, the patient’s initial Glasgow Coma Score was 9 (eyes - 4, verbal - 2, motor - 3), her head was lateralized to the right, she was able to move her eyes and blink to command but was unable to speak, pupils were 3 mm equal and reactive, and her right upper limb was stiff and flexed (unilateral decorticate rigidity) with no movement of her left side even to noxious stimulus. Motor exam revealed increased tone with hyperreflexia in all extremities and bilateral extensor plantar reflex (upgoing plantars).\nNon-enhanced computed tomography of the brain revealed a hyperdense basilar artery (Fig. , ) suggestive of basilar artery thrombosis, and CT cerebral angiography confirmed a 1-cm occlusion of the basilar artery (Fig. ).\nOur patient was deemed not a candidate for thrombolysis and was managed conservatively due to several factors including a late presentation (over 10 h from last known normal) and remained locked-in at the time of her discharge from hospital."
"A 25-year-old Ivorian young man, with no job, was received for consultation in the Neurology Department on 9 January, 2012, for hypersomnia associated with behavioral disorders and chronic headaches. In his background, neither prenatal pathologies nor psychomechanic development disorders were noted. The patient had no antecedent with toxic mania or psychopathology. His hypersomnia was said to have begun in the evening of 27 June, 2008, four years earlier, at the age of 18 after he had taken the national baccalaureate examination. The hypersomnia was triggered by the consumption of alcoholic beverage (a 66cl-bottle of beer) and influenza-like syndromes. It lasted an average of 18 hours. It was accompanied with behavioral disorders with kinds of aggressiveness associated with an eccentric attitude, visual hallucinations related to death, forced thoughts of death, memory loss, and chronic headaches. These episodes lasted about three weeks, and then the patient quickly found his usual lucidity. During these episodes of hypersomnia, the patient had an unusual bulimia. The patient had no known history of substance abuse or prior psychiatric disorder. The neurological examination was normal. The Cranioencephalic computed tomography (CT) was normal. A polysomnography could not be performed due to shortage of financial means. The diagnosis of the Kleine-Levin syndrome was selected. The patient was placed under modafinil in a dosage of 100 mg a day through oral route. A month later, he reported a reduction in the duration of hypersomnia, but with the persistence of visual hallucinations, forced thoughts of death. Since the beginning of 2015, there has been a resurgence of hypersomnia episodes going from once a year to three episodes in the same year. Because of the high cost of the modafinil (200 dollars), the treatment was carried out occasionally."
"A 25-year-old woman with GS presented at 6 weeks gestation with asymptomatic hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. This was her fifth pregnancy. The prior pregnancies had been unsuccessful with the first three resulting in spontaneous abortion before 20 weeks and the fourth pregnancy complicated by fetal demise at 23 weeks. Her initial diagnosis of GS was made after the first pregnancy based on clinical presentation and laboratory data. Pre-pregnancy, she was maintained on oral electrolyte replacement.\nLate into her first trimester she became symptomatic with three separate emergency room visits for abdominal cramping. Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, perioral paresthesias, and tetany were absent. Electrocardiogram was normal. At 10 weeks gestation, on an oral regimen of 60 mEq of potassium chloride and 2,400 mg (119 mEq) of magnesium oxide per day, she was unable to maintain serum potassium levels greater than 3 mEq/L and serum magnesium levels greater than 1 mg/dL. Due to her clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and prior failed pregnancies in the setting of electrolyte derangements, she was started on thrice-weekly intravenous (IV) potassium and magnesium supplementation, as an outpatient at a local hospital, in addition to her oral regimen. Nephrology was then consulted to further guide management of her care.\nDespite her aggressive oral regimen and thrice weekly IV supplementation she was unable to maintain a serum potassium greater than 3 mEq/L and a serum magnesium greater than 1.5 mg/dL. Outpatient, continuous IV electrolyte supplementation was started at 13 weeks gestation. Home health care services were arranged. She was started on a 24-hour infusion of magnesium and potassium. Initial dose of magnesium was 10 g of magnesium sulfate and 20 mEq potassium chloride. The electrolyte solution was reconstituted in 240 mL of normal saline and infused at a rate of 10 mL/h via continuous pump through a peripherally inserted central catheter. The patient had labs monitored initially twice a week and then once a week, with continuously increased doses of electrolyte solutions (, ). With this regimen she was able to maintain serum potassium of 2.5 – 3.3 mEq/L, and serum magnesium of 1.7 – 2.5 mg/dL (normal lab range 1.6 – 2.6 mg/dL), close to our previously defined targets. Her maximum repletion requirements were 120 mEq of IV potassium and 19 g (154 mEq) of IV magnesium sulfate per day. At 28 weeks gestation, due to severe intrauterine growth restriction and reversed end-diastolic placental flow, she was hospitalized and delivered via cesarean section a viable, 636 g infant."
"Case 4 is a 25-year-old woman, the third child of healthy non-consanguineous parents. Pregnancy was complicated by reduced fetal movements. Birth weight was 3130 g (25th centile). Choanal stenosis and persistent ductus arteriosus were present in the neonatal period. She first walked at 4 years and spoke at 3 years old. At the age of 25 years old, her height was 162 cm (25th centile), weight 50 kg (10th centile) and head circumference 49 cm (<0.4th centile). She has severe intellectual disability and aggressive behaviour. She is physically well but has hypermetropia. She has a flat face with upslanting palpebral fissures and wide mouth with thick lips. Short second fingers with bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly was present along with skin syndactyly of toes 2–3 and 4–5. CGH was reported as arr 2p25(5535091–16398225)(hg 19)x1 with deletion of SOX11 and MYCN. The deletion was not found in either parent."
"It was a 25-year-old man with complaint of crooked on his back 14 years ago. He did not seek any medical help because he did not feel any limitation in his daily activity. He went to traditional medicine provider and was treated there for several years.\nPhysical examination showed right curvature of thoracic spine and right sided rib hump (Figures and ). There was no cafe Au Lait. On palpation there was no muscle spasm nor pain. On the movement examination, the forward flexion was 0 to 70 degrees, the extension was 0 to 15 degrees, the left lateral bending was 0 to 20 degrees, and the right lateral bending 0 to 10 degrees ().\nThe radiograph imaging showed proximal thoracic, main thoracic, and lumbar curve. Proximal thoracic Cobb angle is 25 degrees, lower end vertebrae (LEV) is at T5, upper end vertebrae (UEV) is at T2, and the apex is at T4. Main thoracic Cobb angle is 150 degrees, lower end vertebrae (LEV) is at T11, upper end vertebrae (UEV) is at T4, and the apex is at T7, whereas the lumbar Cobb angle is 89 degrees, lower end vertebrae (LEV) is at L5, upper end vertebrae (UEV) is at T12, and the apex is at L3 (Figures and ). The kyphosis angle is 89.5 degrees (Figures and ).\nIt was diagnosed with adult idiopathic scoliosis Lenke 3B+ which meant that the scoliosis had double major curve, nonstructural curve type in proximal thoracic, and structural curve type of both main thoracic and lumbar. The central sacral vertical line touches the apical bodies and the thoracic sagittal profile was positive (hyperkyphotic, kyphosis curve > 40 degrees)."
"Our first patient was a 25-year-old Caucasian woman who was referred to our tertiary neuromuscular clinic for a second opinion regarding her neuropathy. She had a history of heavy alcohol use from ages 18 to 23, during which she consumed as many as eight to ten drinks per day. She first had sensory symptoms at age 22, described as numbness of her feet as if they were “falling asleep.” She initially did not pay attention to the symptoms. Gradually, her symptoms progressed and included burning, electric shock sensation, and allodynia to objects including bed sheets, socks, and the floor when walking barefoot. She was placed on disulfiram therapy (500 mg orally every morning) for 6 months, then discontinued for several months before it was reinstituted for an additional 2 months at the same dose. By the eighth month of therapy, she was unable to walk owing to severe symptoms of pain and stiffness in her legs. She also noted symptoms in her hands. She stopped taking the disulfiram and was able to walk within a few weeks, but she continued to have pain and numbness.\nShe had seen a community neurologist prior to seeking a second opinion in our clinic. Laboratory studies completed previously showed normal levels of HbA1c, vitamins B1 and B12, folate, Sjögren syndrome antigen A and B antibodies, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and antigliadin antibodies. She had monoclonal gammopathy, and results of a sensorimotor neuropathy antibody panel were within normal limits. Pertinent examination findings showed that she had normal motor function except for decreased bulk in her extensor digitorum brevis. A sensory examination showed a gradient distribution decrease in light touch, temperature, and pinprick distally, along with decreased vibration and position sense at her toes. Her gait and reflexes were normal. Electrodiagnostic studies showed a severe length-dependent motor neuropathy, as evidenced by a significantly decreased amplitude in the compound motor action potential (CMAP) in her lower extremities with a preserved CMAP in her upper extremities. There was sparing of her large fiber sensory nerves, as evidenced by normal sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs). Both right and left posterior tibial CMAP waveforms showed temporal dispersion as well as prolonged duration. Electromyography (EMG) was performed on selected muscles in her bilateral lower extremities and revealed 2+ fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in her abductor hallucis muscles. Also seen were polyphasia, increased amplitude and increased duration with decreased recruitment, and increased firing rate to most muscles sampled."
"Term baby boy was delivered by elective cesarean section from a 25-year-old primigravida who was routinely followed and had an uneventful pregnancy. Mother had no history of infection. Birth weight was 3660 grams and the APGAR scores were 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. He did not require resuscitation; just gentle nasal suction was performed. He was admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at 15th minutes with severe respiratory distress including tachypnea (respiratory rate: 98 breaths/min), subcostal retractions, nasal flaring and hypoxia (preductal SaO2: 78%, postductal SaO2: 80%). Baby was put on oxyhood with a requirement of fractional inspired oxygen of 80%. Supine chest radiograph showed typical “spinnaker sail sign” of pneumomediastinum with bubbled appearance of air (Fig. 1a) which was also confirmed with cross table lateral views (Fig. 1b). No pneumothorax was seen. Umbilical artery and venous catheterizations were performed. Arterial blood gas analysis showed normocarbia with hypoxemia. C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 19 mg/dl for which the normal range was up to 6 mg/dl in our local laboratory. Intravenous ampicillin and amikacin were started for empirical therapy. Chest radiogram at the next day showed a new appearance resembling infiltration on left basal lobe. Computed tomography (CT) of thorax with contrast demonstrated multiloculated-multiseptated 45x45x12 mm air collection in the anterior mediastinum located between the thymus superiorly and the heart inferiorly (Fig. 2a). Moreover, there were infiltrations in the inferior lobes of bilateral lungs and left basal extralobar PS with arterial supply originating from thoracic aorta (Fig. 2b). Antibiotic therapy was switched to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam due to infiltrations and persistently high CRP as 15 mg/dl. Unfortunately venous drainage could not clearly be visualized because of umbilical artery catheter that was causing artefact. But a suspicious vascular structure was noticed parallel to the systemic feeding artery (Fig. 2c) which was confirmed as a draining vein on Doppler ultrasound. Besides, the vein of the PS was draining into the azygos vein. Blood cultures were sterile, CRP level were negative in the 10th day of treatment, antibiotic therapy continued for 10 days. He required oxygen support for 17 days and was discharged at the end of third week. At the one-month follow-up, his vital signs and physical examination were normal, and well growing with exclusive breastfeeding."
"A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented 25 days after allogenic HSCT for relapsed B-cell lymphoma with persistent fevers of 102°F, progressive dyspnea, and cough. His chest imaging demonstrated multifocal pulmonary nodules, as seen in and .\nHe underwent bronchoscopy with BAL of the left lower lobe; WBC count was 970/mL (4% polymorphonuclear cells, 41% lymphocytes, 38% histiocytes, and 17% macrophages). Bacterial, fungal, viral, and acid-fast bacilli cultures from BAL were all negative. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy on hospital day 21. Pathologic examination revealed diffuse AFOP as well as an acute and organizing stage of diffuse alveolar damage (). Following surgical lung biopsy, the patient developed the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ventilatory support.\nBoth patients were started on corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg of prednisone equivalence with clinical and radiographic response (). After more than 6 months, both patients had full resolution of their pulmonary symptoms and were maintained on minimal prednisone doses (<5 mg daily)."
"A 25-year-old female was admitted with sudden onset of right hemiparesis. This had been preceded by 2 weeks of gradual, mild weakness and numbness of the right leg. There was also a longer history of 6 months of fevers, malaise, and 16 kg weight loss. She had emigrated from Poland, and had been given several courses of antibiotics before coming to the UK, for presumed urinary tract infection. In the UK, her GP had made a diagnosis of atypical migraine.\nOn examination, the patient was pyrexial at 39.8°C. On cardiac auscultation, there was a grade 5 pansystolic murmur with no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. The neurological examination confirmed a dense right hemiparesis (power grade 0), with right facial weakness, and expressive dysphasia. There were brisk deep tendon reflexes on the right, and the right plantar was upgoing.\nThere were no risk factors for infective endocarditis evident in either the history or examination."
"A 25-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with a rectal foreign body. According to the patient, it was PUF. He used to insert many different kinds of materials, but this was the first time that he could not retrieve it himself. Digital rectal palpation revealed a hard mass with a smooth surface in the anal canal. Laboratory findings and physical examinations were almost normal. A plain radiograph in upright and supine positions showed an increase of colorectal gas without bowel distension, but, unfortunately, an abnormal shadow that looked like a foreign body was not detected. The gas distribution in the rectum and left colon on both upright and supine positions was strangely almost equal (Figures and ). On initial CT images for detecting the exact location of the foreign body and adverse abdominal events, perforation and intra-abdominal bleeding were not detected. Moreover, the foreign body itself and its exact location were not depicted contrary to our expectations (). An endoscopy showed a yellowish mass with a sharply demarcated margin 7 cm from the anal ring, perhaps the lower edge of the foreign body. A physician promptly tried to retrieve it using alligator forceps, but the foreign body was fixed, brittle, easily crushed, and the strategy was not successful. Precise reevaluation of CT images taken with the air attenuation display setting revealed abnormal reticular strands from the distal transverse colon to the rectum, probably corresponding to the foreign body created by PUF (Figures and ). We decided that it was impossible and dangerous to retrieve it per anus because it occupied a long segment on the left side of the transverse colon; therefore, operative removal was selected. The foreign body was removed through the incision in the sigmoid colon. The foreign body was composed of PUF and corresponded to the gas trapped on the left side of the colon on the plain radiograph (). However, the PUF was brittle material and was easily crushed into many pieces by colonic peristalsis. Unexpectedly, it was distributed to the proximal portion of the colon, and we needed 4 other operations to remove the PUF completely."
"A 25-year-old Asian man presented with a mixed thickness thermal flame burn on his left leg 12 months ago. Prior to his arrival at the hospital, he applied toothpaste to the wound as a first aid measure. On examination, the injury was a mix of deep and superficial partial thickness burns with affected TBSA of approximately 3 %. The wound was clean and surrounded by healthy tissues. He was not on any medication and had no known drug allergies. All hematological investigations revealed normal findings with no clinical signs of infection. He was admitted to our Burn Unit for hydrotherapy and advanced multidisciplinary wound care. SMARTPORE Technology polyurethane foam was used on his wound and his response to the treatment was very encouraging. The only challenge was in educating him on the aim of multidisciplinary burn wound care and his role in burn wound management, that is, to be compliant with physiotherapy and to elevate his affected lower limb whenever possible. However, it was clear that the use of SMARTPORE Technology polyurethane foam facilitated physiotherapy and mobility. He rated his pain during dressing change as 2 on a scale of 10, and his pain score remained the same in every subsequent change. His wound showed evidence of epithelialization by day 7 post-burn (Fig. ). There were no adverse events reported."
"A 25-year-old woman, suffered a car accident, without a safety belt. She was initially managed in a trauma center. The initial examination revealed bilateral lower limbs amputations, left femoral shaft fracture, left pneumothorax of 30% associated with massive pulmonary contusion (), scalp wound, C4, C5, left ulna, and right clavicle fractures. She underwent surgery for right supracondylar and left transtibial lower limb amputation. The left femoral shaft fracture was stabilized with an external fixator ().\nDuring the postoperative care she developed catastrophic pulmonary failure, with a poor response to prone and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. Due to this scenario she was transferred to our institution on Veno-Venous ECMO (cannulated in the referral hospital).\nShe developed an infectious focus on both lower limb stumps (Pseudomona aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis). Antibiotic treatment was started with Ceftazidime, Tobramycin, and Linezolid. Hemodynamics remained stable. Stumps were managed with surgical debridement, improving skin coverage using Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) system.\nThe only definitive treatment for her critical condition to eradicate the cutaneous focus necessitated removing the infected pins. As a multidisciplinary team we decided to perform a definitive osteosynthesis with an antegrade centromedular femoral nail (Smith & Nephew Tan®) whilst under ECMO (). Anesthesia was based on intravenous drugs as the transfer of volatile anesthetics via ECMO oxygenators is severely limited. Hemodynamic stability was maintained with transfusion (RBC 2 U) and crystalloids. The internal transport of ECMO patients is a routine procedure, as these patients usually need imaging studies or surgical procedures. During surgery the anticoagulation was set to a Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) of 45 s, with heparin inflow between 10 and 15 U/kg/h. Tranexamic acid was used during surgery at a 15 mg/kg dose. Two days postoperatively she develops an acute 8% hematocrit fall, receiving two red blood cell units and five cryoprecipitated units. After transfusion hemodynamics was stable without evidence of active bleeding.\nThe patient recovered well with improving her gasometrics and respiratory condition. The surgical wounds did not develop any complications, and some small hematomas resolved without active management. Surgery was performed on day 15 under ECMO, and the ECMO was used for a total of 22 days. On the seventh day postoperative the ECMO was discontinued and the patient was returned to her hospital to continue rehabilitation. At 16 months, she is almost recovered, and full fracture healing was achieved, with no complication of the implants."
"The patient was a 25-year-old male, previously healthy globetrotter with intermittent minor lower back pain. During a journey to Australia, he acquired a gastrointestinal infection with up to 10 loose stools per day and abdominal pain.\nStool investigations revealed Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba coli, Dientamoeba fragilis, Endolimax nana, and Giardia lamblia. He was treated with multiple antibiotic courses including metronidazole (400 mg, 3 times daily) but was only temporarily relieved even with negative stool investigations. On returning to Sweden, diarrheas returned as did his abdominal pain. One year later he was referred to the clinic of infectious medicine and thorough examinations showed no etiological factor, resulting in a diagnosis of postinfectious diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Separate treatments with cholestyramine and loperamide had no effect, nor had antibiotics that were prescribed based on suspicion of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. The patient requested treatment with the cultured microbiota as in Case 1. Follow-up 4 weeks later showed normalized bowel habits with solid stools every 1 to 2 days. On follow-up 6 months later his bowel habits had returned to normal."
"A 25-year-old healthy woman, 9 weeks' pregnant, presented to our institution with a progressive swelling in the vagina with exponential growth in the latest weeks. The patient also referred to dyspareunia and coital bleeding. Her gynaecological history included excision of a similar mass four years ago in another hospital, without a histological diagnosis. Clinical examination revealed a glistening, gelatinous, nontender vaginal mass. The tumor arose from the right lateral vaginal fornix and it was a large, well-circumscribed, pedunculated mass (). Ultrasound examination showed a large mass being 11 cm long and with intermediate echogenicity. A diagnosis of probable vaginal wall cyst was made.\nThe patient was submitted to a complete surgical excision of the mass during the 13th week of gestation (Figures –), which revealed its solid nature and the extension to the right paravaginal tissues. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia.\nAt macroscopic examination, the tumor measured 12 × 5 cm with a lobulated appearance, solid and rubbery. The cut surface was whitish and homogeneous. Microscopy revealed a paucicellular neoplasm composed of round and stellate cells with ill-defined cytoplasm and bland cytomorphology in a loose myxoid stroma. There was a prominent population of thick and thin-walled vessels, with no mitotic figures (). Immunohistochemistry was positive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, estrogen, and progesterone receptors (). The neoplasm was negative for S100 protein, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD34, aspects consistent with AA.\nIn spite of not having access to the definitive diagnosis of the vaginal mass excised a few years ago, we believe that this might be a case of recurrent AA.\nThe postoperative follow-up was uneventful and pregnancy was held to term without complications. The patient has a three-year follow-up free of disease."
"A 25-years-old married woman who had two pregnancies and two previous cesarean sections was diagnosed with mitral and tricuspid insufficiency, and pulmonary hypertension in November 2007. She was advised to avoid new pregnancies. In 2009, the patient was admitted in family planning service of Hospital do Servidor Público Estadual “Francisco Morato de Oliveira” (HSPE-FMO) being the permanent contraception using laparoscopy indicated. After preanesthesia assessment the surgery was contraindicated because the patient was at high risk for anesthesia, therefore, the Mirena® IUD placement was indicated.\nAfter approval of hysteroscopic ligation by the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA, acronym in Portuguese), we suggested this contraceptive method to the patient who immediately agreed.\nThe procedure was carried out in the hysteroscopy room of ambulatory gynecology at HSPE-FMO. The technique used was vaginoscopy, as described by Bettocchi and Selvaggi(, which consists of performing the test without prior digital vaginal examination and without the use of speculum or Pozzi forceps to traction the cervix. A 2.9-mm-scope was used, with a 30° angle, an internal inflow sheath, final diameter of 4mm and oval distal extremity (Bettocchi hysteroscope, Karl Storz®, Germany). For vaginal distension, 0.9% saline solution was used, at room temperature, with pressure determined by gravity and pressure cuff filling around the flexible flask, with continuous flow, pressure of approximately 100mmHg, and insufflation sufficient to adequately visualize the cervical canal and uterine cavity. The image was transmitted to a TV monitor, with a 300-W xenon light source. The procedure was carried out with no anesthesia or analgesia. After visualize uterine cavity with Mirena® IUD and tubes, the catheterization and detachment of devices were initiated ( to ). The procedure duration was 5 minutes with no complications.\nThe patient classified her pain as 3 after the procedure according to analogical pain scale that varied from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever experienced). She also did not report any discomfort after the procedure and returned to her daily activities on the same day.\nPelvic radiographic after 3 months showed that devices were correctly placed. Subsequently her IUD was removed ( to )."
"A 25-year-old man was referred to the Department of Oral Medicine with complaint of a swollen lesion in the oral cavity. The patient reported a rapidly-growing painless lesion during the last 20 days. On physical examination, an erythematous and ulcerative tumor measured about 2.5´3´3 cm was observed in the palatal side of left maxillary second and third molar teeth ().\nThe clinical features including ulceration, mobility of the adjacent teeth, and rapid growth of the lesion suggested some differential diagnosis such as minor salivary gland tumors, osteosarcoma, lymphoma, and aggressive reactive lesions. The teeth adjacent to the lesion were mobile, without decay, slightly sensitive to percussion, and vital in vitality test. For further evaluation, panoramic and periapical radiographs were requested ().\nLaboratory test results were negative for any evidence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypercalcemia.\nAn incisional biopsy of 1×1×1 cm was performed under local anesthesia. The mass of the lesion was friable and strongly hemorrhagic during biopsy. To control bleeding, various methods were used including local pack with gas, using hydrogen peroxide, and suturing the region. Yet, these methods were not efficient and, finally, the greater palatine artery was ligated with a deep suture.\nThe microscopic evaluation showed heavy infiltration of plasma cells arranged in large sheets or nodules. Microscopically, the plasma cells showed varying degrees of differentiation with sparse stroma. The majority of plasma cells were poorly or moderately differentiated with large and distinct nuclei, but the minorities were well differentiated. Many mitosis and occasional debris containing macrophages were seen. There were modest number of lymphocytes in fibrosis septa between the lobules of plasma cells and focal surface ulceration ( and ). Bone marrow biopsy failed to show evidence of myeloma. The skeletal survey was also unremarkable. Serum proteins and immunoglobulin levels were within normal limits. Urine examination showed no Bence Jones protein.\nA diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma was made on the basis of clinical, radiographic, and histopathological findings. Immunohistochemical staining was used to confirm the monoclonality of plasma cells ( and ). The patient received radiotherapy; 40 Gy was fractioned in 4 weeks. After a while, all clinical symptoms of the lesion disappeared and he was in the same condition up to one year. Thereafter, the patient was not accessible for follow-up."
"The patient was born to a healthy unrelated 25-year-old mother and a 27-year-old father without family history of multiple congenital anomalies, intellectual disability, recurrent pregnancy loss, or infertility. The girl was born by natural delivery at 37 weeks of gestation. Her birth weight was 2.520 kg (approximately, -2SD), length 48 cm (approximately, -1SD), and head circumference 33.5 cm (approximately, -1SD). At birth, her metabolic and neonatal hearing screening were all normal.\nHer develop milestones were delayed. Head holding was acquired at 6 months of age, she started to sit up at 10 months and walked with support at 21 months. At age of 21 months, her weight was 7.6 kg (approximately, -3SD), her height was 76 cm (approximately, -2SD), and her head circumference was 43.2 cm (approximately, -3SD). She presented with mild dysmorphic features including flat facial profile, dolicocephaly, hypertelorism, short philtrum, flat nasal bridge and posteriorly rotated and low set ears. She also had a short fifth finger on both hand (Fig. ). Developmental Screening Test (DST) showed that the DQ and MI scores was 58 and 55, respectively."
"In March 2013, Mr. A, a 25-year-old male, was playing football when another player's knee collided with his thigh. He remembered immediate pain and swelling over his upper quadriceps. However, he was able to continue playing and later that evening the pain increased in severity. Mr. A was unable to sleep and the next morning he presented to the university sports injury clinic. At this stage, examination noted visible swelling but no neurological or vascular compromise. Initial treatment consisted of rest, ice, and analgesia and the patient was discharged with crutches.\nUnfortunately, 5 days later, Mr. A returned with increased swelling, bruising, and paraesthesia. He was referred to the emergency department for further assessment. shows the extent of the thigh swelling. His routine blood tests revealed haemoglobin of 80 g/L (normal 135 g/L–175 g/L). CT scan of thigh estimated the haematoma volume at >2 L and given his early neuropathy he was referred for urgent fasciotomy.\nAfter fasciotomy (), Mr. A required two units of packed red cells. A coagulation screen preoperatively showed normal PT and APTT and increased fibrinogen. Six days after fasciotomy closure, Mr. A re-presented with swelling and a discharging wound. The wound was evacuated and further packed red cells were transfused. Another coagulation screen was performed prior to skin grafting, which revealed a prolonged APTT of 34 seconds (normal range 21–32 seconds).\nFurther investigations by haematology revealed a low Factor IX of 27.2% in keeping with a diagnosis of mild haemophilia B. Prophylactic enoxaparin was discontinued and regular tranexamic acid was started. Mr. A made a full recovery within 2 months and is now under the care of a comprehensive care haemophilia centre. He had extended family screening confirming his mother and maternal grandmother as carriers of haemophilia as well as a maternal aunt whose son was confirmed to have haemophilia."
"A 25-year-old black man originally from Guiney presented in the emergency department with a four-year history of a right knee slow growing mass for evaluation. The patient had a giant mass located around the right knee, which was in forced flexion and with no extension ability. There was no pain or vascular or neurological compromise despite the remarkable size of the lesion. Nonetheless, patient could not walk due to tumor size and knee fixed flexion (). No other clinical findings or associated symptoms were disclosed.\nThe X-ray, CT scan, and MRI (Figures \n–) revealed images showing an unusual large bone tumor of the proximal tibia. The patient underwent bone biopsy for definitive histological diagnosis, which was consistent with giant cell tumor. A radical surgical resection was proposed.\nPreoperatively the patient returned to the emergency department due to a low energy fall but with an excruciating pain in the right knee. The new X-ray series disclosed a supracondylar femur fracture requiring surgery.\nTo obtain a most secure solution regarding a patient originally from Guiney where there is no medical assistance, we chose to perform an extensive extra-articular en bloc resection (until the supracondylar fracture site) and reconstruct the lower limb as a knee fusion, with a tibia structural allograft. Intraoperatively we performed an extra-articular resection through the supracondylar femur segment and the tibia diaphysis. All nerves and blood vessels were preserved. A tibia allograft was then interposed in the defect, and a knee arthrodesis nail was used to stabilize the construct (). Distally, the tibia allograft received the additional support of plate and screws to increased integration probabilities within the remaining patient's tibia.\nPostoperatively there were no complications, which allowed patient discharge during the first week. Partial weight bearing supported by crutches was allowed since the first day after operation. Follow-up with clinical and radiographic evaluation took place in the outpatient clinic, again without complications. The final histopathology diagnosis of the specimen () was an aneurysmal bone cyst.\nCurrently, with one year after the index operation, the patient is independent for daily live activities and only uses a walking aid occasionally. Radiographic assessment revealed no construct failure and good evolution to allograft integration (). Limb length discrepancy is about two centimeters with no impact in function, which will allow patient to return to his home country."
"This was a 25-year-old nulliparous woman, with a spontaneous pregnancy, 12 weeks of gestational age according to the last menstrual period. The pregnancy was uneventful until 11 weeks of gestational age. After that, the woman started to complain of progressive abdominal distention associated with abdominal discomfort, but no other symptoms were reported.\nThe first trimester routine ultrasonography showed enlarged ovaries, multiples cysts and ascites.\nThere was no reference to illness. Menstrual cycles were irregular without dysmenorrhea, acne or hirsutism. There were no records of gynecological diseases.\nUpon admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable. Her pelvic examination showed uterus size compatible with gestational age, and large and mobile bilateral adnexal masses.\nLaboratorial exams showed hemoglobin level of 13.1g/dL, hematocrit of 39.5%, hypoalbuminemia of 2.3g/dL, and hypoproteinaemia of 5.2g/dL; coagulation tests, hepatic and renal function had no changes (urea of 29mg/dL and creatinine of 0.8mg/dL). Serum β-hCG was 24,487mIU/mL, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 2.2μUI/ml and free T4 was 1.8ng/dL. All results were within normal parameters. However, levels of estradiol were higher (10,562pg/mL).\nTransvaginal sonography revealed a single live fetus at 12 weeks and normal amniotic fluid. The patient’s ovaries were enlarged (right ovary was 13.9cm and the left ovary was 12.8cm measured from their major axis) with multiple cysts, and moderate amount of pelvic fluid. The ultrasound screening for chromosomal abnormalities was negative.\nDuring hospitalization, she was under clinical and sonographic surveillance and received intravascular human albumin for 3 days, furosemide (40mg/day) and prophylactic dose of enoxaparin. She remained clinically stable, and recovery was seen in serum exams and sonographic parameters. The patient was discharged on the sixth day of hospitalization. At hospital discharge, the ultrasound revealed large ovaries, the right with 9.3cm and the left with 8.1cm measured from their the major axis. There were no signs of ascites.\nThe pregnancy continued without other complications. A male newborn (birth weight 3,125kg) was born at 38 weeks and 5 days of gestational age by vaginal delivery. No complications occurred after the delivery.\nTen days of postpartum, the patient was asymptomatic, and at the sixth week after delivery she started to use intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate depot for contraception. No alterations were seen at physical examination. Pelvic sonography showed regular and uniform size uterus, a thin and regular endometrium; her ovaries were normal."
"Patient 2 was a 25-year-old male (Table ) who reported frequent headaches and dizziness. MRI of the brain revealed a 0.9-cm nodular lesion at the medullocervical junctional level. This patient underwent midline suboccipital craniotomy. A heterozygous missense mutation was identified in the VHL gene: p.Glu70Lys. There was no family history. This patient regularly visited the clinic, and no other VHL-related tumor developed."
"25-year-old left hand dominant female presented to the ED after an all-terrain vehicle accident. She reported tenderness with palpation of the left fifth metacarpal but had normal sensation and two-point discrimination. The patient's vital signs were as follows: BP 110/76 mmHg, HR 93 beats/min, RR 16 breaths/min, SpO2 98% on RA, and temperature 36.9°C; pain was reported as 10/10. The patient's hand radiograph showed a comminuted and dorsally displaced fracture of the left fifth metacarpal. The patient underwent an in-plane left ulnar nerve block under ultrasound guidance (). The fracture was successfully reduced, the injury was splinted, and pain was noted to be 4/10. At the time of discharge, vitals were BP 102/51, HR 75, RR 16, and SpO2 100% on RA, and the patient was given a prescription for Vicodin for pain control at the time of discharge."
"A healthy 25-year-old gentleman with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of abdominal pain that started immediately after being punched in the flank during a hockey fight. He was able to skate to the bench but unable to continue playing due to the pain. He then developed severe nausea and vomiting while driving home, which prompted his presentation to the emergency department. Questioning revealed an uncomplicated birth history with standard prenatal care. He denied any history of urinary tract infections and abdominal or flank pain before this presentation.\nPhysical examination revealed a hemodynamically stable well appearing gentleman in no apparent distress. His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended without organomegaly or abdominal herniation. External genitalia examination revealed a normal phallus with no rash or skin changes, no blood at the meatus, as well as no scrotal swelling or erythema. Furthermore, the patient was able to void without problems while in the emergency department.\nLaboratory results were remarkable for an elevated creatinine of 1.9. There was no microscopic hematuria on urinalysis.\nAbdominal CT without contrast demonstrated a large, low-density retroperitoneal fluid collection consistent with urine that extended along the right paracolic gutter and into the pelvis. Also noted was a defect in the right renal pelvis, which was severely dilated and associated with severe right cortical atrophy (). These findings were consistent with a Grade IV renal trauma according to the Revised Renal Injury Staging Classification. There were no other traumatic findings of the abdomen and pelvis.\nUrology was consulted and recommended 24 hours of observation to ensure that the patient remained hemodynamically stable and pain remained well controlled. His severe cortical atrophy was interpreted as undiagnosed congenital UPJ obstruction with long-standing obstruction and his elevation in creatinine as reabsorption of extravasated urine. Acute intervention was deemed unnecessary, given the inferred functional status of his right kidney; significant bleeding and expansion of the urinoma were unlikely. Percutaneous decompression and need for future characterization of his UPJ were unlikely to be of use, given the presumed minimal contribution of his injured kidney to his overall renal function. His hospital stay was without event, and he was discharged the following day with outpatient follow-up with urology in 6 weeks for symptom check and abdominal ultrasound."
"A 25-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, presented with post-prandial epigastric discomfort evolving over 2 years and post-prandial vomiting since 1 month. The patient reported 2.5 kg weight loss over 2 months. Physical examination revealed a left para-renal mass on deep palpation. Blood analyses were not relevant. CEA and CA19-9 were in the normal range. The patient was HIV1-2 negative. Chest and abdominal X-ray films were considered normal. An upper abdominal barium follow through was considered normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 6 cm diameter hypoechogenic mass in the left peri-renal space. CT scan showed a 6 × 7 cm mass, containing multiple small calcifications, which was highly hypervascular and regular in shape (figure ). An arteriography confirmed the presence of hypervascularity with flushing of the mass (figure ). Surgery was planned with a preoperative diagnosis of malignant retroperitoneal tumor.\nAt laparotomy a 7 cm diameter mass was found in the left anterior peri-renal space, just inferior to the renal artery. The lesion was completely excised with what seems, clinically, to be a capsule. No organ resection was needed.\nPathologic diagnosis was localized Castleman's disease of the hyaline vascular type. Patient had had a simple postoperative period, except of persisting lumbar pain, attributed to a small inferior renal infarct (confirmed by CT scan). The patient is free of disease 5-years after resection."
"A 25 year old woman with a seven years history of intravenous drug abuse was admitted to our hospital after 6 days with fever and chills. Her vital signs included a temperature of 39°C, a heart rate of 110 bpm, a blood pressure of 125/70 mmHg. Findings on cardiac examination were unremarkable, as were the results of the remainder of the evaluation. Results of laboratory examinations included a white blood cell count of 12.000 cells/mm3, an erythrocyte sedimentation time of 100 mm and a reactive C protein of 5 mg/100 ml (0.5 upper limit). A set of three peripheral blood culture from different sites were made. A Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed the same day as the patient was admitted to the hospital. A structure due to an eustachian valve was noted in the right atrium. Furthermore a mobile mass of 1.5 cm × 0.8 cm was noted to be attached to the eustachian valve. Another mobile mass of 0.6 cm × 0.8 cm was noted on tricuspid valve (Figure ). A diagnosis of endocarditis on eustachian and tricuspid valve was made. The patient started an empiric antibiotic therapy with oxacillin 12 gr/day ev and netilmicin 300 mg/day ev. After 5 days from admission in the hospital, 3 blood cultures grew methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus. After eight days of persistence of fever a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed to exclude local complication related to infective endocarditis. The TEE confirmed the diagnosis of eustachian and tricuspid valve endocarditis and excluded local complications due to infective endocarditis (Figure ). In the following days the patient became afebrile and was discharged form the hospital in good clinical condition after a 6 weeks course of antibiotic therapy."
"A 25-year-old man was referred by his optician, who had noted an abnormal left macular appearance during a routine check-up. He was asymptomatic and achieved unaided vision of 6/6 bilaterally. On examination, the left macula showed scattered superficial refractile deposits at the retinal surface. There was also an infero-temporal 2 clock hour retinal dialysis and secondary longstanding retinal detachment, with evidence of recent extension. The patient gave a history of being assaulted 6 months earlier. The right retina was normal. He underwent uncomplicated retinal detachment surgery with subretinal fluid drainage using a monitored drainage technique, with a 25-gauge needle externally through the sclera as previously described.[], cryotherapy and scleral buckling. The retina was attached postoperatively and he maintained 6/6 vision during a follow-up period of 2 years.\nAnalysis of sub retinal fluid showed multiple small brilliantly birefringent crystals under polarised light. They were unlike the large rectangular or rhomboidal shaped crystals with notched borders typical of cholesterol.[] The crystals consisted of spindles clustered together in regular polyhedral shaped rosettes with a radiate pattern (Illustrated in Fig ) measuring approximately 1–3 microns in size.\nBoth patients were completely fit and well with normal renal and liver function, good nutrition and no previous surgery or general anaesthesia. There was no history of canthaxanthin or nitrofurantoin use. Blood cholesterol and oxalate levels were normal. There was no family history of retinal disease."
"A 25 year old male patient was admitted with a diagnosis of Eales' disease and a non-resolving vitreous hemorrhage involving the left eye of 2 months duration. Ultrasound evaluation of the posterior segment revealed findings consistent with an organized vitreous hemorrhage and incomplete posterior vitreous detachment. Transconjuctival sutureless pars plana vitrectomy was planned using the Bausch and Lomb 25G vitrectomy system. Per-operatively, sleeve for the infusion line was first placed in the inferotemporal quadrant transconjunctivally using the 25 G trocar. After inserting the infusion line through the above sleeve, two more sleeves for the endo illuminator and vitreous cutter were made using the 25G trocar transconjunctivally. Vitrectomy was started using high cut rates (1500 cuts/min) and suction of 500 mm Hg. A fibrovascular frond was noted attached to the disc, which had to be diathermised. To accommodate a conventional unimanual bipolar diathermy probe a localized peritomy was made and the superonasal sclerotomy was enlarged using a 20 G MVR blade. The frond was diathermised, endolaser pan retinal photocoagulation was completed and the conventional sclerotomy was closed using 6-0 vicryl mattress suture placed at a depth of about 75% of the scleral lip. Vitreous was well cleared from this wound opening using the vitrectomy probe around the edges of the sclerotomy before closure. The sleeves of the remaining two 25 G sclerotomies were removed and the overlying conjunctiva was slightly massaged in that area. No wound leak was noted at the end of the procedure. Postoperatively intraocular pressure of 10 mm Hg was recorded.\nUltrasound biomicroscopy (Paradigm model P40) of the sclerotomy sites was done on day 2 postoperatively and again repeated on day 7 and day 14. The port sites were identified at the 20G site by the color of the vicryl suture and at the 25G site by the distortion of the overlying conjunctival vasculature. On day 2, we observed a wide gape at the site that had been enlarged to accommodate the diathermy probe using a 20G MVR blade. In contrast to this, the other two sites wherein sleeves were placed transconjunctivally using the 25G trocar showed only a mild gape (figure ). While significant gape continued to persist at the subsequent evaluations on day 7 and day 14 only at the port that had been enlarged, the other two ports showed only a minimal gape of the internal lip (figure 2). In addition, we also observed some vitreous incarceration at one of the 25 G sclerotomy sites."
"A 25 year-old-male presented with a history of cough with bloody mucoid sputum for the previous two months. He also had anorexia and a history of intermittent upper respiratory tract infections for two years. Clinical examination revealed diminished breath sounds at the right lung base. Laboratory investigation reported normochromic – normocytic anaemia, with low iron serum level and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (76 mm/first hour).\nHis chest radiograph revealed a perbipheral right lung opacity, and computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a right lower lobe soft tissue density mass [Figures , ]. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were not identified. Bronchoscopy was negative. Transthoracic fine-needle aspiration under CT guidance was not diagnostic. A complete study of bone, brain and abdomen was also performed to assess the stage of a presumed bronchogenic carcinoma and no extrapulmonary involvement was noted. Surgery was carried out to obtain diagnosis and achieve cure. The patient underwent a right lower lobectomy and complete lymph node dissection through a right posterolateral thoracotomy. Macroscopically, the mass appeared well-circumscribed and yellowish in colour on cut section. Microscopically the mass was composed of fibroblasts, collagen and inflammatory cells mainly of lymphocytes and plasma cells (Figure ). There was no mitotic activity. No microorganisms were detected even on special stains. The overall features suggested an inflammatory pseudotumor. All lymph nodes were negative for malignancy. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient discharged home on postoperative day 10. The patient remained well and asymptomatic two years later."
"This 25-year-old white woman was initially evaluated for proteinuria. Examination revealed a right single pelvic kidney and uterovaginal agenesis. She had normal sexual secondary development. Kidney biopsy showed focal and segmental hyalinosis. Spine radiograms were normal. Her karyotype was normal. At 26, she was treated by sigmoid colpoplasty []. During surgery, uterovaginal agenesis was confirmed with small rudimentary uterine horns."
"A 25 year old man was brought to the emergency room (ER) with quadriparesis after a fall from a bicycle. Although he had facial deformities since early childhood, he professed only to cosmetic embarassment, nasal blockage, mouth breathing, mild snoring and progressing bowing of his shins. There were no other affected family members. He was gainfully employed and had been riding a bicycle to work, when he skidded off the road into a sand patch, landing on his face. At the point of impact, he bruised his face. He was able to turn over, but immediately noticed some neck pain and weakness of all four limbs. He was just able to lift his arms and move his legs from side to side. He was transferred by ship from his island to our hospital and was seen three days after the injury. On examination, he had leontiasis ossea (leonine facies due to symmetrical frontal and maxillary bossing) (Figure ). Examination of the oral cavity showed a symmetric soft tissue bulge of the hard palate (Figure ). He had broad forearms, sausage like fingers and bowing of both legs with saber shins (Figure ). The nasal bridge was flat and elevated due to a soft tissue thickening (Figure &). No café au lait spots were observed. Neurological examination revealed grade 3 power (MRC scale) in his arms with pronounced distal hand muscle weakness and grade 2 power in his legs. All deep tendon reflexes were absent, plantar reflexes were extensor and there was a sensory level to all modalities at the groin.\nMRI of the spine showed diffuse enlargement of the laminae, transverse processes and spinous processes of the entire spine (mainly involving the posterior elements) with cervical canal stenosis and a cervical cord contusion at C 4–5 level. On T1 weighted images the posterior elements were hyperintense. The facet joints of the cervical vertebrae were also enlarged. (Figure ) The cranio-vertebral junction was normal. Skull X-rays and CT scans (Figure ) with bone windows showed diffuse thickening of the inner and outer tables of all the skull bones with a widened diploe. The brain parenchyma, subarachnoid cisterns and paranasal sinuses were normal. His routine blood examinations, blood glucose, serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphate levels, and thyroid function tests were normal. Urinary mucopolysaccharides were absent. The clinico-radiological picture was compatible with a generalized form of PFD. He was initiated on IV methylprednisolone 1 gm OD for 5 days and was able to start walking in 5 days. He was discharged home on the 10th day with residual distal hand muscle weakness and grade 4 muscle power in his legs."
"A 25 year old man underwent electrophysiology study for recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal palpitations. There were no documented episodes of supraventricular tachycardia on surface ECG. Delta waves were absent on baseline ECG.\nA decapolar catheter was placed in the coronary sinus with the distal and proximal pair of electrodes configured as CS 1-2 and CS 9-10 respectively. Quadripolar catheters were positioned in the high right atrium, His-bundle region and right ventricular apex. During straight atrial pacing with a drive-cycle length of 340ms, the following arrhythmia was induced (). The corresponding electrogram is shown in . What is the mechanism?"
"A 25-year-old Caucasian female with a history of heart transplant, presented with shortness of breath. Twenty one days prior to her presentation, she had P. carinii pneumonia for which she was treated with augmented doses of Bactrim (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole). She also noticed a progressive lower extremity edema, pleuritic chest pain, dry cough, and chills. She was diagnosed as chronic renal failure and was started on hemodialysis as an outpatient. During hemodialysis, she experienced abdominal pain radiating to the back. She presented to the emergency room with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute pancreatitis secondary to a stone in the pancreatic duct. She was admitted and shortly after, she required intubation because of decreased oxygen saturation. A chest X-ray showed increased interstitial markings, suggestive of interstitial lung disease. Bilateral pleural effusions were also noted and attributed to the chronic renal failure with fluid overload. Recurrence of P. carinii infection was also considered a possibility. BAL was performed as part of a diagnostic-treatment protocol and 15 cc of cloudy pinkish fluid was sent for cytopathologic evaluation. Two Papanicolaou (PAP) stained SurePath™ preparations were prepared.\nThe PAP stained SurePath preparations showed characteristic globular alveolar casts of amorphous material which stained green, orange, and centrally orange with a green rim (Figure ). This material was PAS positive and was resistant to diastase (Figure ). GMS stain (Figure ) did not show the characteristic crushed ping-pong ball like structures with central to eccentric dots (Figure ) observed in the frothy casts associated with P. carinii pneumonia (Figure ).\nOxygen saturation improved after BAL procedure. Three days later she was extubated, and was discharged within a week. Apart from a hysterectomy for severe cervical dysplasia six months after this event, she has had an uneventful healthy course. Currently she is alive and well."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian female with skin type 2 (Fitzpatrick classification) presented because of a plum-sized pedunculated keloid on the upper part of her left helical rim. She reported that 10 years ago she had already experienced formation of a nodule in this area which became evident 6 months after an ear piercing. This keloid-like nodule was excised twice and injected with steroids. At the time of presentation the plum-sized keloid on her helical rim had been increasing in size and was accompanied by severe pruritus (Fig ). We introduced our patient to an audiology technician in order to design and build a specially silicon pressure splint for her left ear (Fig ).\nThe keloid was then excised with cold steel. Immediately after the operation a combination of 0.5 ml triamcinolonacetonid and scandicain 2 % was intralesionally injected. The custom made silicon splint was applied directly after surgery and steroid injection (Fig ). The injections were repeated at intervals of 8 weeks for 12 months. The patient was instructed to wear the splint for 24 h a day, 7 days a week. A clinical check-up one year and 24 months after the last injection showed no tendency to relapse (Fig and Fig )."
"A twenty five year old man presented to the Emergency Department following an unwitnessed collapse. After playing on his computer for ten hours overnight he got up from his computer at 4 am and lost consciousness without any warning. He was found by his mother and he appeared to be disorientated.\nThe emergency department doctor's examination found a small cut to the nose. The patient was disorientated, exhausted with generalised weakness and subsequent difficulty in moving either arm. Both shoulders were documented as symmetrical with no injury to the soft tissues and grossly neurovascularly intact but were uncomfortable and had limited range of movement. A 'first fit' was diagnosed, bloods were requested and a referral was made to the medical team. The doctor starting the next shift performed a full musculoskeletal examination because of the persisting pain in the shoulders. Radiographs of the shoulders were taken and confirmed bilateral anterior shoulder dislocations (Figure ). The dislocations were reduced under sedation and the patients' upper limbs were placed in poly-slings. After four weeks of physiotherapy shoulder movements returned to normal."
"A 25-year-old Angolan male patient presented with 2-month history of asthenia, weight loss, and cervical swelling. Examination showed a right 5-cm retroauricular firm mass (Figure ).\nBlood workup showed no anemia, mild lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein (22 mg/L), and sedimentation rate (53 mm). HIV infection was ruled out, and the interferon-gamma release assay was positive. A biopsy was performed and revealed necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis suspicious of tuberculous lymphadenitis. Both protein chain reaction and cultures for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were positive. The diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis (A.K.A. scrofula) was made, and the patient was started on isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for an additional 4 months, with a total of 6 months treatment, with good tolerance and favorable response.\nDespite consistent decrease in tuberculosis (TB) incidence in the World Health Organization European regions, it still poses a major public health issue. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections manifests mostly as pulmonary disease, but extrapulmonary manifestations can occur.\nExtrapulmonary TB is not always easy to diagnose, and in cases like ours, biopsy of the lymph node, with TB smear and culture exams, is critical to the diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of precocious recognition and treatment to prevent further complications."
"The index subject was a 25-year-old female with a history of two periods of major depression according to the DSM-IV-R criteria. She had also had hypomanic periods that did not completely fulfil the criteria of mania, and at baseline she fulfilled the criteria of hypomania, moderate depression and dysthymia (296.32, 300.40). She was overactive, restless and irritated and coped with a reduced amount of sleep. She had difficulty in concentrating on one thing at a time, and she appeared very lively and talkative. She was therefore diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder type II. In other words, our index patient had a mixed mania without fulfilling the criteria of full-blown mania during the baseline scan."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred for cutaneous lesions on the right leg, developing a month after she returned from Mali. She had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease at age 22, and was maintained in complete remission under mesalazine. On physical examination, she had pustular plaques of the right leg (figure ), with two satellite lesions of smaller size. There was no sign of digestive relapse. She had already been treated with oxacilline (3 g/day, 7 days), without any improvement. Clinical hypotheses were Sweet's syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, pustular psoriasis, bacterial or parasitic skin infection, and mycetoma. Repeated bacteriological and mycological investigations were negative. Skin histology showed a lymphohistiocytic hypodermal infiltrate, associated with non-caseating multinucleated giant cells granulomas (figure ). Antimicrobial agents were discontinued, and bethametasone dipropionate 0.05% cream was initiated. The plaques decreased in size and infiltration by more than 75% within 3 weeks."
"The patient was a man aged 25. He was a smoker (20 cigarettes per day) since the age of 19. His symptoms started on June 1998 at the age of 24, with chronic diarrhea not accompanied by mucus or blood in the stools, abdominal pain, fever, or loss of weight. Two years previously on June 1996, he had noticed a slight swelling of the lower lip which contrasted with the previously normal appearance of his mouth (Figure ). He consulted a specialist in oral medicine, who performed a lip biopsy. The histology of the specimen (13 × 7 × 7 mm) showed a multilayer squamous epithelium covering the tissue specimen, scattered clusters of lymphocytes and histiocytes resembling non-caseating granulomas, as well as infiltration of the small vessel walls of the underlying connective tissue by monocytes (Figure ). The diagnosis was compatible with granulomatous cheilitis. Colonoscopy performed in 1998 revealed large ulcers in the terminal ileum and caecum. Enteroclysis confirmed the involvement of the terminal ileum in a total length of 50 cm. Administration of methylprednisolone, mesalazine and cholestyramine, resulted in prompt improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.\nDuring the subsequent years the disease course included at least two clinically evident recurrences of moderate severity that responded well to the administration of corticosteroids and mesalazine. Six years after diagnosis a new recurrence of CD of moderate severity (CDAI 226 points) was noticed, accompanying by lip swelling as well (Figure ). Enteroclysis and colonoscopy plus ileoscopy showed active disease confined to the terminal ileum and the cecum.\nThe characteristic of the clinical course of the patient was the fact that during the exacerbations of CD, the enlargement of the lip was more evident, returning to almost normal during the periods of remission and that the administration of corticosteroids resulted in prompt improvement of the lip swelling."
"A 25 years old male patient with burst fracture of C6 vertebra with quadriplegia was taken to the operating room for anterior decompression with fusion. He was positioned supine on the operating table. The neck, shoulder region and the upper part of chest up-to the level of nipples was shaved. General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated for intra-operative ventilation using closed circuit. The neck, shoulder and chest region was painted with CutaseptR (contains Benzalkonium chloride and Isoproponol 63%). The surgical site was draped with cotton sheets. A longitudinal incision was given along the anterior border of sternomastoid and the subcutaneous tissue was exposed. Electrocautery was then brought into the field for deeper dissection. Flames were noticed around the surgical site immediately after the activation of the electrocautery. The flames were spread over the entire surgical field corresponding to the area prepared with CutaseptR. The drapes were immediately removed and the electrocautery was switched off. The fire was rapidly extinguished within seconds. The patient suffered minor burns in the neck and chest region (first degree) and recovery was uneventful."
"A 25-year-old man had a car accident with severe head injury, pelvic fractures, rupture of the symphysis, partial urethral rupture and traumatic bladder perforation at the bladder dome with extension to the right bladder wall. The bladder perforation was treated with primary bladder closure, while the partial urethral rupture was treated with urethral catheterization. The patient's overall health status improved progressively, however, he developed neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Thus, a suprapubic catheter for continuous bladder drainage was necessary for 1 year. One and a half years after suprapubic catheter removal, he presented with sterile microhematuria confirmed by repeated urine examinations. Cystoscopy detected a papillary tumor at the right and posterior bladder wall with extension to the bladder base. The bladder dome was tumor-free. The tumor was removed by transurethral resection (TUR). The histologic diagnosis of nephrogenic adenoma was confirmed by two independent pathologists.\nFollow-up consisted of routine urine analysis, cystoscopy and cytology every 3 months. A second TUR was performed because of histologically proven recurrence. The upper urinary tract never showed any signs of tumor spread. Microhematuria occurred again 1 year after initial presentation of the tumor. Cystoscopy now found a diffuse and progressive growing exophytic tumor with extension almost throughout the entire bladder wall (Figure ). Cytology revealed malignant cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma. Further histologic examination confirmed the reappearance of the nephrogenic adenoma (Figure ). However, additional focal transformation to a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was detected (Figure ). Staging procedures were negative for metastatic spread. A primary tumor origin in the gastrointestinal system was excluded. A radical cystoprostatectomy with neobladder reconstruction was performed because of the diffuse and extensive growth pattern. Final histology confirmed nephrogenic adenoma with multifocal transformation to a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with tubular growth pattern. Postoperative tumor classification was tumor present but no invasion (pT1), multifocal, no lymph nodes involved (pN0), no metastasis M0, grade 2 (G2) and resection shows no tumor (R0). The current follow-up is 4 years and the patient remains tumor-free."
This was a 25 year-old right-handed male mechanic. His right thumb was trapped and crushed between two hard objects causing avulsion of skin and soft tissue at the MCP joint. The bone avulsed at the interphalangeal joint with the extensor and flexor tendons attached to it and detached from its muscolotendonous junction. Same reconstruction procedures done as shown (Figure ).
"A fit and healthy 25-year-old Caucasian woman presented with asymmetry and gross bilateral tubular deformity of the breasts. Subsequently, a bilateral breast reconstruction with 350 cc Becker™ (Mentor, UK) implants was performed. At the time of surgery, 200 ml of saline was used to inflate both implants. The left implant was further inflated 1 and 5 months later using 80 ml of normal saline on both occasions, to optimize symmetry.\nOne year later, both ports were removed as a day case procedure. At that time, the right port was removed without complication. However, the left port was surrounded by a viscous fluid simulating implant rupture. A silicone gel bleed was suspected and another operation was planned where the left prosthesis was replaced with another permanent implant. The fluid and a sample of the periprosthetic capsule were sent for histological review. Histological examination revealed that the fluid was synovial fluid. The sample of capsule was found to be fibroadipose tissue, composed of fibrin-organizing histiocytes, lymphocytes and multinucleate giant cells. The capsule had undergone synovial metaplasia, which explained the presence of synovial fluid around the left implant. A typical histological appearance of synovial metaplasia is shown in Figure ."
"A, healthy 25 year old Asian male presented with a 3 day history of sudden onset worsening pain of the right forearm and hand. He was a non-smoker with no history of trauma and no past medical history of note. On examination, he had classical signs of acute limb ischaemia consisting of pallor, coldness with prolonged capillary refill of about 10 seconds and sensory and motor impairment. Pulsatile mass in the root of the right side of the neck with a bruit and flow murmur was also elicited. On hand held Doppler ultrasound of the right arm, a diminished ulnar artery signal and a monophasic radial artery signal were detected, along with a normal brachial artery signal. A clinical diagnosis of aneurysm of the subclavian artery was made with embolic occlusion of the brachial artery.\nAt this point the patient was commenced on intravenous heparin and the symptoms partially improved. A brachial angiogram (Figure ) and Computed Tomography angiogram revealed a right sided cervical rib and saccular aneurysm in the mid-portion of the subclavian artery, proximal to the clavicle. The aneurysm measured 1.1 × 2 cm. Brachial artery occlusion due to a thrombus extending from the mid-upper arm to the distal part of the elbow was also demonstrated. Intra-arterial thrombolysis was attempted but failed due to extravasation following direct puncture of the axillary artery. 6 days after initial presentation, the patient underwent a subclavian artery aneurysm repair with a cervical rib excision and brachial embolectomy. He was treated with warfarin for 3 months post-op. Post operative Doppler scan revealed good signals in the right ulnar and radial arteries. Follow-up of the patient in clinic 3 months post-discharge, revealed no complications and complete resolution of the symptoms."
"This is a case of a 25-year-old Hispanic male presented to the Emergency Service with one-day history of dark urine and left thigh swelling. Two days prior to his complains, after having no training for the last six months, he decided to resume his physical activity. Without previous warming-up he began with a very heavy leg work-up. He also forced his left leg more than his right leg, the reason for that was 12 months earlier he had underwent surgery of his left knee due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury.\nAfter 48 hours he noticed his urine became dark and his left thigh got swollen. He denied any past medical history apart from the surgery, he was taking no medications and he also denied any alcohol, drugs, steroids, hormones, dietary supplements consumption or injections on his lower extremities. Social, family and sexual histories were unremarkable. The physical exam revealed a mildly left thigh swelling, compared to his right thigh, and tenderness over his left quadriceps to deep palpation. Neurological exam was normal, and pulses were present in both extremities; also a compartimental syndrome was excluded with a Doppler Ultrasound. Chemistry analysis (Table ), Urinalysis (Table ) and Urine toxicology screening (Utox) was negative for alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates and phencyclidine.\nDue to the clinical scenario and the value of creatine kinase (CK) obtained 1,454,952 UI, the patient was diagnosed of exertion-induced rhabdomyolysis. Also an increased in his aminotranferases enzymes was observed Alanine Aminotranseferase (ALT) 555, and Apartate Aminotransferase (ALT) 2292. Laboratory results were repeated 4 hours apart due to the electrolyte imbalances commonly seen in this pathology, showing a CK of 1,423,878 and normal creatinine and potassium. He was treated with a vigorous hydration, intravenous fluids (IV) of 0.9% NaCl, at a rate of 500 ml/hr, reaching a urinary output > 200 ml/hr. During his clinical course he presented no complication, 12 hours later the CK concentration was 321.244 UI, on day 2 CK was 299.148, on day 3 the CK decreased up to 181.196. After four days of IV fluids, his CK was 95.870, creatinine 0.9 and his thigh swelling was solved. The patient was discharged on day 5 with a CK of 52.476, creatinine of 0.9 and monitored as outpatient every 2 days, checking his CK and renal function. After 8 days his CK was less than 1000 with a normal creatinine 0.9."
"A twenty five years old Indian male presented to our clinic with painful swelling over his right ring finger. He was involved in a motor vehicle accident three weeks prior to the visit and sustained injury to his right ring finger. He didn't seek any medical treatment initially as he had minimal pain and was able to function with minimal difficulties then. However as the pain and swelling had been persistent, he had decided to come for medical attention.\nOn examination, the right ring finger was swollen with tenderness elicited mainly around the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints.\nThere was a mallet deformity and he was not able to actively extend the affected joint.\nThe proximal interphalangeal joint was grossly swollen and deformed with no active or passive range of movement.\nX ray showed dorsal dislocation of proximal interphalangeal joint with avulsed bony fragment from distal phalanx of the right ring finger. (Figure )\nInitially a closed reduction was attempted under digital block but was unsuccesful.\nWe then proceeded with an open reduction under general anaesthesia.\nIntra-operatively, we noted a volar plate fracture with dorsal dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint and marked fibrosis. (Figure ).\nFibrotic tissues were removed. Dislocation was reduced and stabilized using wire. (Figure ).\nThe Mallet injury was treated with mallet splint.\nK-wire was removed after 3 weeks and aggressive mobilization of PIP was started. The Mallet splint was kept for 6 weeks.\nOn latest review 3 months after the operation, there was no extension lag of DIP joint with flexion (0–40°)\nThe PIP joint was stable but stiff with flexion of 10°–90°. He was advice on continuous exercise."
"On May 24th, 2007, a 25-year-old man developed fever, night sweats, headache, two skin necrotic lesions on the buttocks and the thighs, respectively, and a maculopapular rash. On June 10th he complained of acute visual loss. A bilateral chorioretinitis was diagnosed (). A maculopapular rash was still present involving the palms and soles (). He was initially treated with intravenous ganciclovir as well as eye drops as a cytomegalovirus infection was suspected. On June 23rd (day 29), a late serum tested positive for spotted fever group rickettsiae. Oral doxycycline plus ofloxacin was started with an intravenous methylprednisolone regimen. The clinical course was favourable, but three months later the recovery of visual acuity was incomplete and fundus examination of the left eye showed a disorganisation of the macular neuroretina. When interviewed again, the patient reported contact with ticks when he visited a friend at the beginning of May. Written informed consent has been obtained from this patient to report case details and pictures."
"A 25 years old male patient presented for examination. Several incidents of Grand Mal epileptic seizure were referred with the last one three weeks ago. After the last episode both shoulders' range of motion was regressed and pain was elicited with movement. The patient visited a hospital at that point and without radiographic control performed, the diagnosis of bilateral shoulder contusions was posed. About three weeks later and as the patient realised that his injury was irreversible, he presented to the emergency room of our hospital. Clinical examination made clear that bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation was the point. (Fig. ). No neurovascular injury was diagnosed in any arm. At the time of examination the patient was able to perform flexion and abduction of both arms up to 60 degrees as well as almost full external rotation with no pain restraint. From the patient's history no previous incidence of shoulder dislocation was referred. Radiographic control and Computed Tomography Scanning revealed the dislocations as well as a sizeable greater tuberosity fracture of the left humerus and Hill Sachs lesion at both sides. (Fig. ).\nBilateral reductions under general anaesthesia and internal fixation of the left greater tuberosity fracture were performed (Fig. ). The reductions were easy to perform and shoulders' stabilisation was not carried out. No post manipulation neurovascular deficit was observed. Ultrasonography performed 4 days post surgery confirmed the integrity of rotator cuffs in both shoulders. Broad arm polyslings in abduction and internal rotation were used for 2 weeks and progressive mobilization started with pendulum exercises, forward flexion and abduction. A physiotherapy program of muscle enforcement was added at 3 weeks. The recovery was successful and after 2 months the patient had regained a normal range of motion in both shoulders with a minor lack at the last degrees of flexion and internal rotation of the left shoulder. Four months post-operatively the range of motion was fully recovered bilaterally and at the final follow-up, 2 years post surgery, the patient had not undergone any recurrent dislocation."
"A simple hepatic cyst was detected in the left lobe of the liver of a 25-year-old man in 1993 (Sadly, there was no imaging.). The patient was followed in our hospital, and no surgical treatment was performed although the cyst showed gradual enlargement. The patient was admitted to our hospital due to epigastralgia and for re-examination of simple hepatic cyst in 2004. In 1996 the cyst was unilocular, 6 cm in diameter without calcification, septa or papillary projections as observed by CT (Fig. ). In 2001 the cyst remained the same diameter but exhibited calcification and septa (Fig. ). An abdominal CT performed on admission in 2004 showed that the unilocular cyst had grown to over 10 cm in diameter with increasing mounting calcification, septa and thickening of the wall within the cyst (Fig. ). MRI revealed a partly low intensity, partly high intensity T1-weighted image, and high intensity T2-weighted image (Fig. ). US revealed a unilocular cyst over 10 cm in diameter and partial septa within the cyst (Fig. ). Abdominal angiography showed the tumor to be hypovascular and stretching of left hepatic artery. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed compression of the bile duct and no communication between the cyst and the bile duct was shown. The serum level of aspartame aminotransferase (AST) and almandine aminotransferase (ALT) were slightly elevated but tumor markers such as CEA and CA 19-9 were within the normal range. The cystic lesion was suspected of being a mucin-producing liver tumor, such as hepatobiliary cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. Despite of these findings, we could not rule out the malignancy clearly. Therefore, in November 2004, left lobectomy of the liver with cholecystectomy was performed. Macroscopically, a resected specimen was a unilocular tumor filled with mucus. The cut surface of the tumor exhibited an elastic white-colored scar and yellowish papillary nodule (Fig. ). The unilocular cyst had a solid component with papillary projections, septa and calcification and was filled with liquid-like muddy bile. Histopathological examination revealed that the inner layer of the cyst was lined columnar epithelium exhibiting mild grade dysplasia and partially lined with papillary epithelium (Fig. ). Dense mesenchymal stroma was not detected. On the basis of these findings, hepatobiliary cystadenoma was diagnosed. The postoperative course was uneventful and recurrence of the lesion has not been observed. We believe this case provides evidence of a simple hepatic cyst changing into hepatobiliary cystadenoma over a 10-year period."
"A 25-years old male, previously well, presented with fatigue, sweating, shortness of breath on exertion and weight loss over a 4-months period. During the last two weeks prior to admission he developed atypical chest pain, cough and hemoptysis. There was no relevant past medical history.\nClinical examination was unremarkable apart from right apical bronchial breathing with no signs of superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction. ECG showed incomplete RBBB, sinus tachycardia with left anterior fascicular block. Chest X ray demonstrated right apical infiltration. Both complete blood count & biochemistry profile were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 65 and C – reactive protein 58. Sputum culture was positive for acid fast bacilli. Bronchial biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation of bronchial mucosa in keeping with tuberculosis. Protein C & S were normal\nTransthoracic echocardiography showed dilated right atrium (RA) with a large ""horse-shoe"" mass involving most of the RA wall (Figure ). CT scan showed confluent ill-defined areas of consolidation with multiple thin-walled cavitations at the upper lobe of the right lung and multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (Figure ).\nCMR showed extensive soft tissue mass involving the right atrial wall circumferentially with complete SVC obstruction and partial inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction. The azygos vein was dilated consistent with SVC obstruction (Figure ). The late gadolinium-enhanced images showed diffuse enhancement within the mass indicating necrosis or inflammation (Figure ). Cardiac biopsy was requested but the patient declined.\nA diagnosis of cardiac tuberculoma predominately involving the RA and both SVC and IVC with possible secondary thrombus was made. The patient received anti-tuberculosis as well as anticoagulation therapy and there was remarkable improvement of symptoms. Follow up echocardiography (Figure ) and CMR (Figure ) 12 months after the start of therapy showed significant reduction of the mass and partial resolution of the IVC obstruction but the SVC obstruction remains."
"A 25-year-old Pakistani male with chronic liver disease (Hepatitis C positive) underwent branding of the anterior abdomen with a heated metal rod for severe pain (Figure ). One week later, he presented with altered mental status, high grade fever and multiple round circumscribed erythematous and indurated lesions on his abdomen ranging in size from 3 to 5 cm with black eschar and active drainage. His past medical history was noncontributory except for hepatitis C, diagnosed 10 years earlier. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed massive free fluid with splenomegaly and a shrunken liver. The ascitic fluid had a high white cell count (16,000/mm3) with 95% neutrophils. He was treated with a 3-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone and topical silver sulfadiazine and sterile dressings for 2 weeks. The fact that this was the first presentation with hepatic encephalopathy after branding, and pan sensitive E. Coli grew both from the branding inflicted skin wounds and ascitic fluid, points towards skin wounds inflicted by branding as the likely culprit for bacterial peritonitis and decompensated cirrhosis."
"A 25 years old female from Afghanistan presented to the medical out patient department of Combined Military Hospital Quetta with complaints of cough for 2 years, and hemoptysis and left hypochondrium pain for the last six months. There was history of occasional fever but no weight loss. Her weight was 48 Kg. Breath sounds were diminished over right mid zone. She had received various medications including anti-tuberculous treatment in Afghanistan. Posteroanterior and right lateral chest x-rays (Fig ) revealed a large dense round well demarcated opacity involving the mid zone of the right lung field posteriorly. Ultrasonography revealed large simple cysts in the right lung (Fig ) and the spleen (Fig ). Both cysts showed the classic double wall sign. The liver and the rest of the abdomen were free of cysts. Hemoglobin, total leukocyte count and differentials were normal. A large unilocular hydatid cyst was removed form the right lung through a posterolateral thoracotomy. Oral albendazole 400 mg b.i.d. was given for 5 days preoperatively and 4 weeks postoperatively. The splenic cyst (Fig ) was removed six weeks later, preserving the spleen. The patient's immediate recovery was remarkable and her symptoms were relieved completely."
"A 25-year-old female was admitted to the emergency room with fatigue, recurrent black stools. She was hospitalized because of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Profuse anemia with a hemoglobin level of 4.4 g/dl and the hematocrit 17% was detected. Three packs of red blod cell were transfused immediately. She did not have obvious hematochesia The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy did not show any bleeding lesion. An antral gastritis was only detected during the gastroduodenoscopy. Double contrast barium enema was also normal. We canceled the previously scheduled colonoscopic examination after detecting a 5 × 4 cm sized abdominal mass in the small bowel mesentery through abdominal computed tomography (Figure ). Surgical exploration was planned. During the explorative laparotomy, a 5 × 5 cm sized mass was detected in the mesentery of the ileum. Partial small bowel resection and end-to-end small bowel anastomosis was performed. She was discharged on the 6th postoperative day. Six months follow-up was uneventful.\nHistopathologic examination of the resected specimen revealed a cavernous hemagioma of mesenteric origin (Figures , )."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred to us with a 5 day history of moderate localized pain in her right lower abdomen that was not radiating to any other site and was not associated with nausea or vomiting. The patient had mild pyrexia (temperature 99.4°F). On examination of her abdomen, a well-defined mildly tender localized fixed lump 7×5cm in size was found in the right iliac fossa. The hemogram showed a total leukocyte count of 11,000/mm3, with 60% polymorphonucleocytes. Ultrasonography (USG) of her abdomen revealed an oval-shaped abdominal mass in the right iliac fossa, suggestive of an appendicular lump.\nThe patient was put on the Ochsner-Sherren regimen. However, recovery was found to be slow and incomplete, and a smaller non-tender lump 5×5cm in size was still present at the end of 4 weeks. Repeat USG was suggestive of an unresolved appendicular lump.\nOn exploratory laparotomy through a lower midline incision, a hard mass lesion was found on the inner side of the anterior abdominal wall of the right iliac fossa, to which omentum was firmly adherent. The appendix was found to be normal and a wide-based Meckel's diverticulum was also present at 2 feet proximal to the ileo-caecal junction. Wide excision of the suspicious lesion was carried out with a clearance margin of 2cm all round and the resultant fascio-muscular defect in the anterior abdominal wall was repaired with polypropylene mesh. The Meckel's diverticulum and the normal appendix were also excised.\nThe excised mass was bisected and, to our surprise, a copper-T IUCD was found embedded inside (Figure ). The uterus was examined but there was no evidence of any perforation. The abdomen was closed and a tube drain was left in situ.\nOn cross-checking with the patient on the following day, she gave a history of copper-T insertion about 6 months previously.\nThe drain was removed after 48 hours, and the postoperative period was uneventful. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 7th day after removal of stitches. She was asymptomatic at 1-month follow-up."
"A 25-year-old single Nigerian man was admitted via the surgical outpatient clinic with a two-year history of scrotal swelling which was initially small in size, non-painful and not associated with fever. The swelling gradually increased in size to the extent of impairing free movement of the patient both because of its weight and size in between the lower limbs. The swelling made sexual intercourse and voiding in the standing position impossible. The skin was intact without associated ulcerations, and there was no difficulty in voiding though the penile shaft was buried in the swelling. There was no history of chronic cough suggestive of pulmonary or disseminated tuberculosis. He had no problems with his eyesight and no other swellings on his body were known.\nHe had a history of surgery to the two inguinal areas about 10 years before presentation; surgical details were not available nor was any histology available. He was from a polygamous home and took neither alcohol nor any other substance of abuse. There was no history of a similar lesion in his relatives or his acquaintances at his place of abode.\nPhysical examination showed a healthy looking young man with a giant scrotal swelling of a size greater than that of his head. There were hyperpigmented giant ruggae in otherwise intact skin with the penile shaft buried in the scrotal wall skin (Figure and ). The swelling was non-tender, non-pitting and non-reducible with the cord barely discernible at the neck. Bilateral inguinal scars were seen with significant lymphadenopathy.\nHemogram, serum electrolyte, urea and creatinine, urinalysis, urine microscopy culture and sensitivity were all within normal limits. Scrotal ultrasound showed a thickened scrotal wall but the scrotal content was normal.\nHe subsequently underwent a modified Charles' procedure with a primary penile shaft split-thickness skin graft (Figure ) performed by a team of general surgeons and plastic surgeons. His immediate postoperative condition was satisfactory (Figure ). On the postoperative day seven, the penile skin graft showed good skin take and some good granulation tissue over the exposed testicles.\nThe patient continued to have wound dressing until the perineal wound had healed and contracted appreciably leaving about a 3 cm raw area of the wound at the six postoperative week (Figure ). He had an uneventful postoperative course with the scrotal wound healing completely by the eighth postoperative week (Figure ). He is now about one year post-surgery and doing well. The patient is physically and socially satisfied with his improved quality of life."
"A previously healthy, 25-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our outpatient clinic with a five-week history of progressive low back pain, radiating continuously to the left leg. Her past medical history and her physical and neurological examination revealed no significant abnormalities. Temporary loss of sensibility in the dermatome of L4 was reported, which resolved spontaneously. A blood investigation demonstrated low serum calcium levels of 2.04 mg/dl (2.20-2.60 mg/dl) with normal alkaline phosphate levels of 42 U/L (40-120 U/L). There were no clinical signs of endocrinopathies or café-au-lait hyperpigmentation of the skin. Radiographs of the lumbar spine showed an isolated radiolucency of the fourth lumbar vertebral body (Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed an expansive lesion of the L4 vertebral body with partial bone destruction (Figure ). The bone of the vertebral body showed signs of partial remodelling and sclerosis and there was cortical destruction of the posterior wall with some epidural extension. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging following intravenous gadolinium administration displayed a heterogeneous enhancement of the lesion (Figure ). Cystic components were identified; blood fluid levels within these cysts, however, were absent. Differential diagnosis included an ABC and giant cell tumour. Whole-body bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-HDP (oxidronate) showed an intense, local enhanced uptake at level L4 with areas of decreased uptake demonstrating the cystic components (Figure ). There were no other locations of 99mTc-HDP enhancement. Percutaneous transpedicular biopsy of the lesion was performed. Histological examination of this biopsy showed characteristic features of both FD and the formation of ABC (Figure ). The patient underwent subtotal vertebrectomy of the L4 vertebral body including curettage of the entire cyst wall, all abnormal spongy tissues and bone surfaces that were lined with fragile and hypervascular membranes. Stabilization and reconstruction of the defect was performed with the use of an anterior stackable cage filled with tricalcium phosphate granulate and anterior instrumentation. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. At 24 months follow-up radiographs and CT imaging showed a progressive fusion of the anterior fixation with no signs of recurrence (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old woman received five doses of fluconazole (150 mg) once a month for recurrent vaginal candidiasis. She was healthy but had a family history of atopic dermatitis. She noticed a red erythematous macule on the medial side of her right popliteal fossa after taking her second dose of fluconazole. With time, the macule faded, but a violet pigmentation developed. A month later, after taking another dose, she again developed two macules; one developed on exactly the same site and the other in the left popliteal fossa. Both patches were symmetrical and similar in appearance. Again, the patches faded and hyperpigmented areas developed. At this point, she was examined by a dermatologist and misdiagnosed with lichen planus and treated with topical clobetasol that led to the development of striae on both sites. Four hours after taking the fifth dose, the macules reappeared along with a new macule on her right upper lip. She suspected that the symptoms were caused by fluconazole and again visited a dermatologist. An oral challenge test with fluconazole (150 mg) was conducted 4 weeks later and showed similar signs three hours after intake. Local provocation was performed with 10% fluconazole in petrolatum on the left pigmented area and 10% fluconazole in ethanol on the right pigmented area. For comparison, the same compounds were tested on normal skin on the back. After 16 hours, two red patches developed on both sides of her legs and none on her back. A skin biopsy specimen from the left popliteal area revealed a lichenoid infiltrate, a basal cell vacuolization, dermal melanophages and a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with FDE. Despite having a family history of atopic dermatitis, she had no major or minor symptoms of atopic dermatitis and she denied having any other reaction to drugs or any allergy history. We recommended that she discontinue using fluconazole.\nTo determine the cause of the recurrent vaginitis, her complete medical history was taken. She had experienced mid cycle spotting while using low-dose oral contraceptives therefore she switched to using high-dose oral contraceptives 2 years before our study. She was also working in a fitness center during that time and she mentioned that she wore a wet swimsuit for long periods of time and used tight synthetic clothes all of which were risk factors for vaginal candidiasis []. At this time, we recommended that she use other contraceptive methods for example, condoms. Furthermore, we asked her to wear cotton underwear and informed her of preventive methods of candidiasis. We followed up with her after 6 months and she mentioned she had not experienced any other episode of candidiasis since then."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian man was admitted with a 24-hr history of central abdominal pain, which radiated to the right lower quadrant. The pain worsened when the patient moved, strained and coughed. He did not complain any vomiting, urinary tract symptoms or change in bowel habits. His past medical history showed an open appendectomy operation performed in another hospital one year before the admission to our Institution.\nHis axillary temperature was 37.3°C, rectal temperature 38.2°C. Base line investigations showed white blood cells 12.030/mmc with slight neutrophilia at 9.170/mmc and C-reactive protein 4.4 mg/dL. Urinalysis was normal.\nPhysical examination showed rebound tenderness in right iliac fossa during abdominal palpation in the proximity of a well-healed McBurney’s’s incision scar. Plain abdominal X-Ray revealed radiopaque image of about 1.5 cm in right lower quadrant (RLQ). Abdominal ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic oval mass that contained a hyperechoic formation and a small amount of fluid in RLQ.\nIn the same day a computed tomography was performed, which confirmed the existence of a hyperdense formation in RLQ surrounded by an edematous and spastic viscera (). The patient was treated with i.v. fluids and antibiotics.\nIn the next day an abdominal ultrasonography was repeated revealing that, despite the past medical history of appendectomy, the oval formation arising from the base of the cecum could have been a residual appendix and the hyperechoic formation an appendicolith ().\nThe patient underwent explorative laparotomy. The McBurney’s incision previously made was used, and a mass (6 × 3 × 1.5 cm) was found under the ilocaecal junction (), which proved to be a stump appendicitis with a faecolith (1.5 cm) in it. Appendicectomy was performed, and the stump was inverted into the cecum using purse string suture, a drain was placed in the site of the operation. Post-operative course was uneventful and he was discharged 5 days after admission. The histologic evaluation reported suppurative stump appendicitis."
"A 25-year-old lady presented to hospital 36 days after giving birth via an uncomplicated lower segment caesarean section. She stated that the scar was well healed since the fifth day post-surgery and she had begun breast feeding. There was no history of nipple trauma or mastitis. She complained of a 15 day history of progressive pain, swelling and decreased range of motion in her right knee. Systemic examination revealed pyrexia of 38.5 degrees Celsius and a tachycardia of 120 beats per minute. Examination of the knee demonstrated a red, hot, swollen, tender joint with minimal range of motion. Radiographs of the knee were unremarkable. The knee was aspirated under aseptic conditions and 35 mls of turbid fluid was collected.\nBlood laboratory results were as follows: white cell count 15.8 × 109/L, CRP > 250 and ESR 75. Initial gram stain of the aspirate showed 3+ of white cells but no organisms.\nIn view of the clinical picture, the patient underwent urgent arthroscopic washout of the knee. It was noted that the synovium was thickened and inflamed, and biopsies were taken. Furthermore, there was a significant amount of pus in the suprapatellar pouch. The knee was washed out with nine litres of normal saline.\nCultures of the pus taken from the knee subsequently grew Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to flucloxacillin. Cytology of the fluid was negative for crystals. The biopsies taken revealed acute synovitis with extensive ulceration of the synovial lining lined by inflammatory exudate composed of fibrin, polymorphs and scattered macrophages.\nThe patient was given intravenous benzylpenicillin (1.2 g QDS) and flucloxacillin (1 g QDS) post-operatively and the patient clinically improved. She underwent a further arthroscopic washout of the knee three days after the original procedure. It was found at the second operation that there was some pus in the lateral arthroscopy portal wound though no pus within the knee joint itself.\nIn total, the patient completed a week's course of intravenous antibiotics and four further weeks of oral antibiotics (Penicillin V 500 mg QDS, Flucloxacillin 500 mg QDS). She was seen in the out-patient clinic 11 weeks after her presentation where she was noted to be doing well with an improved range of motion in her knee of 0-80 degrees."
"A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department with severe hypotension. There was a history of gradually progressive dyspnea over 6 months. Physical examination revealed engorged neck and chest wall veins and a swollen face. The jugular venous pressure was found to be raised, suggesting superior vena cava (SVC) compression. The frontal chest radiograph [] showed mediastinal widening that was predominantly in the superior part.\nEchocardiography was performed and a diagnosis of a loculated pericardial effusion on the right side of the heart was made; the heart had been displaced to the left and there was compression of the right atrium and ventricle. Pericardiocentesis yielded thick turbid fluid. CT scan of the chest showed a fluid-density cystic lesion with no enhancement; it was situated in the anterosuperior mediastinum and measured 183 × 132 × 154 mm in size. The lesion had displaced the heart to the left, with compression of the right atrium and ventricle; there was also encasement and compression of the major vessels, including the superior vena cava and its tributaries []. No associated vertebral anomaly was detected. The patient was taken up for immediate surgery, which revealed a large, tense, cystic mass in the anterosuperior mediastinum, attached to the pericardium. It was resected intact. There was no evidence of any intraspinal extension or fibrous connection with the thoracic spine. The cyst showed homogeneous contents and had a smooth wall. Histopathology revealed a fibrous wall lined by stratified squamous epithelium with laminated overlying keratin, consistent with a diagnosis of epidermoid cyst []. The patient unfortunately succumbed to postoperative respiratory complications"
"A 25-year-old woman was referred from the division of nephrology for evaluation and management of a cardiac mass found on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient had a kidney transplant15 days ago for lupus nephritis. Three years earlier, the echocardiogram revealed mild mitral regurgitation, but no mass was noted on the tricuspid valve and there was no transvalvular blood flow abnormality. Chest X-ray, physical examination, and electrocardiogram were within normal range. Laboratory data, including work-up for infective endocarditis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were unremarkable except for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) 1:320 (homogenous type) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (+). The ejection fraction was normal and mild mitral regurgitation was noted. The TTE showed an incidental finding of a 1.1 × 0.9 cm mass attached to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (Figure ) [see Additional file ]. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a highly mobile, oval mass that had a well-demarcated border with a stalk (Figure ) [see Additional file ]. We considered surgical removal of this mass. However, given the patients' co-morbidities and her refusal to undergo surgery, she was followed with conservative treatment, including anticoagulation with heparin for two weeks. However, the mass remained unchanged. The patient was followed at two month intervals for three years after discharge from the hospital. Each follow-up included the evaluation of symptoms. There were no symptoms or complications resulting from the possible embolus. Three years later, the tricuspid mass size was decreased on follow-up echocardiography (Figure ) [see Additional file ]."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with a left paramedian neck swelling that had been present for the last 3 years. It had increased in size over the last 3 months. There was no history of dysphagia, hoarseness, or fever. Physical examination revealed a firm, cystic swelling, measuring about 5 × 4 cm, which moved with deglutition and with protrusion of the tongue. Routine blood investigations and thyroid function tests were within normal limits. USG of the neck showed a well-defined, cystic mass in the left paramedian region at the level of the hyoid bone, with a heterogenous component in the submental region that showed calcification []. There was no significant cervical lymphadenopathy. The thyroid gland was normal. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the lesion was suspicious for mucoepidermoid carcinoma. To delineate the extent of the lesion, MRI was performed; it demonstrated a multicystic lesion (hypointense on T1W and hyperintense on T2W images) in the submental region, extending between the bellies of the mylohyoid muscles into the floor of the mouth and abutting the body of the hyoid. A few small hypointense foci were seen on T2W images that were suggestive of calcification []. A large cystic component was seen in the left submandibular region, separate from the submandibular gland and in close relationship to the strap muscles []. The smaller cysts in the submental region showed peripheral enhancement on CT and foci of calcification [].\nBased on the above imaging features, we felt that there was a strong possibility of a papillary carcinoma in a TDC. Sistrunk's procedure was performed and, per-operatively, a cystic mass with a solid component was noted close to the hyoid bone; it was adherent to the belly of the digastric muscle, the strap muscles, and the mylohyoid muscles. Histopathology of the resected specimen confirmed the diagnosis of a papillary carcinoma arising from a TDC []."
"An unbooked, 25-year-old, consanguineously married woman with 7 months' amenorrhea was referred for routine obstetric USG. Her parity index was gravida 3, para 2, living 1 and dead 1. Her first child was healthy and the second baby had died 1 week after birth; the cause of neonatal death was not known. Her hemoglobin was 9 gm/100 ml; she was Rh positive. The TORCH test was negative. Maternal serum calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels were within normal limits.\nAntenatal USG (Logiq 200, Wipro GE, Bangalore, India) revealed a single live fetus in cephalic presentation at 28 weeks of gestation. Important findings included severe polyhydramnios (amniotic fluid index: 34) [], a highly echogenic aortic wall [], echogenic cardiac outflow tracts [], pericardial effusion, a large atrial septal defect, giving the appearance of a single atrium, bilateral pleural effusion, ascites, subcutaneous edema and echogenic kidneys. The rest of the organs appeared normal. Early grade III maturity of the placenta was noted. On the basis of the gray-scale findings, a diagnosis of IAC was made and fetal echo and follow-up scan were suggested. Follow-up scan after 1 week showed intrauterine fetal demise. The dead fetus was delivered vaginally. Radiographic examination confirmed aortic calcification []. Autopsy of the fetus confirmed the other findings such as fetal hydrops, thickened cord-like aorta [] and large atrial septal defect. Histopathological examination showed calcification of the tunica intima and media. Sections from the kidneys, spleen, liver and thymus showed calcific deposits and parenchymal psammoma bodies."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian man, who was otherwise fit and well, presented with recurrent intermittent left loin pain. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed mild left hydronephrosis and a dilated left ureter down to the level of the bladder, with no evidence of renal tract calculi. A MAG-3 diuretic renogram demonstrated good bilateral drainage but with significant dilatation of the left collecting system and ureter, with the left side contributing 49% of the total function, suggestive of a non-obstructive megaureter.\nAfter initial conservative management with 6-monthly reviews for 3 years, the patient developed frequent urinary tract infections accompanied by haematuria and further left loin pain. His left renal function was shown to have deteriorated from 49% to 35% by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy imaging over a 6-month period. An open ureteric reimplantation was therefore performed, with excision of the distal ureter, tapering and tunnelling of the ureter using the Leadbetter-Politano procedure. The dissection was difficult, with the mega-ureter being quite adherent, and the operative time was two hours. The histopathological findings were consistent with a left mega-ureter in a state of chronic reflux. The patient made a good functional recovery and did not suffer from any further loin pain. A MAG-3 renogram at the follow-up after 2 months showed an increase in the left kidney function from 35% to 43%.\nHowever, three months postoperatively, the patient reported ejaculatory difficulties, and a spermatozoa-containing post-ejaculatory urine sample confirmed a diagnosis of retrograde ejaculation. Cystoscopy revealed normal bladder neck and outflow. He was unresponsive to alpha-agonists and therefore referred for assisted contraception at his request. After a follow-up of three years, the retrograde ejaculation still persists at the time of writing, while the flank pain remains resolved."
"A 25-year-old Sri Lankan woman was referred to our unit with a preliminary ultrasound scan (USS) suggestive of a liver cyst. She had right hypochondrial pain, and several episodes of intractable itching. Only one of these episodes of itching was associated with clinically and biochemically proven obstructive jaundice.\nOn examination, she was anicteric and did not have any features of liver disease. Abdominal examination was unremarkable.\nLiver function tests were normal. Serum tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), α feto protein and CA 19-9 levels were within normal limits. An USS of the liver showed a 5.5 cm × 4 cm multiloculated intrahepatic cyst with several smaller cysts within. The intrahepatic ducts were slightly dilated, with the cyst probably extending into the proximal bile duct. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) confirmed the presence of the cyst in segment 4B of the liver which had an enhancing thin wall with multiple septa and no intracystic solid component (Figure ). CECT also revealed intrahepatic, common hepatic and proximal common bile duct dilatation probably due to an extension of the lesion along the left hepatic duct. A hydroxy iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan excluded a direct communication of the cyst with the biliary tree. Serum echinococcus IgG levels were normal.\nLaparotomy confirmed a lesion in the left side of the liver with an extension into the common hepatic duct along the left hepatic duct. The gallbladder was extrahepatic. During left hepatectomy, the cyst extension was removed intact, through the cut end of the left hepatic duct (Figure ). A synchronous cholecystectomy was performed once the resection surface of the liver had been checked for biliary leaks by injecting saline through the cystic duct. The patient had an uneventful recovery.\nHistology revealed a multilocular, mucinous biliary cystadenoma lined by a single layer of glandular epithelium, arising from the left intrahepatic ducts. A basement membrane separated the epithelial lining from the underlying ovarian type mesenchyme. The patient is well at 24 months with no evidence of recurrent disease."
"A 25-year-old male, resident of Noida (Uttar Pradesh), presented with history of sensation of heaviness of left upper abdomen since three months. The sensation was not related to meals, exercise or any other activity and was present continuously. There was no history of dyspepsia, prolonged fever or weight loss, abdominal pain, altered bowel habits or urinary complaints. There was no other significant medical history. The examination was unremarkable except for presence of a palpable tip of spleen. His routine investigations revealed a Hb-12.3 gm%, TLC-9700/cu mm, DLC of N80L18M1E1, and an ESR of 54 mm at end of first hour. Ultrasonography of abdomen revealed an enlarged spleen (15.7 cm) with well encapsulated cystic lesion measuring 7.9 cm × 6.3 cm × 7.8 cm. The characteristic double line sign was seen. The Contrast enhanced CT revealed an enlarged spleen (16 cm) with a well defined homogenous hypodense lesion with an enhancing capsule seen in posterior part of spleen measuring 8.4 × 7.2 cm in size (). The liver and other abdominal organs and chest were normal. ELISA for Echinococcus was positive. A diagnosis of primary hydatid cyst of spleen was made and patient was put on oral albendazole for a month and advised splenectomy which the patient refused."
"The patient is a 25-year-old woman with a history of paraplegia secondary to transverse myelitis, complicated by scoliosis and chronic vertebral osteomyelitis, who had undergone multiple previous orthopedic procedures for her spine and 2 pedicled flaps for her pressure sores. She had undergone left hip disarticulation and excision of the proximal femur for an extensive hip pressure sore. She had open wounds on the left side of the ischium and along the sacrum, which after debridement measured about 600 cm2, and were reconstructed with a left total leg fillet flap. She lost an estimated 1 L of blood and got transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells. The flap healed well without complication with follow-up lasting 7 years."
"A 25-year-old male with a vascular malformation on the right side of his upper lip was operated upon using the unilateral upper lip lift technique []. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged the day after surgery. Within 6 days following the operation, he returned to work. Six months later, the scar was found to be aesthetically acceptable and the unilateral long lip had been corrected []."
"A 25-year-old female with end-stage kidney disease was referred by a nephrologist for the purpose of transplantation. She had a history of recurrent urinary tract infection. A urine analysis was showed microscopic pyuria and a urine culture showed traces of the E. coli organism. After treatment with antibiotics, a voiding cystourethrography was performed showing bilateral Grade IV vesicoureteral reflux []. A ultrasonography had detected an empty left renal fossa; an echogenic irregular kidney with an abnormal shape was present in the right lumbar region. A three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast showed a left to right crossed fused renal ectopia with right kidney malrotation. The ectopic fused kidney was situated anterior and lateral to the orthotopic kidney [].\nAfter discussing the risks and benefits of open and laparoscopic surgery with the patient, and with consent for open conversion if required, the patient was subjected for retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy for fused kidneys.\nAn endotracheal intubation was performed after general anesthesia. The patient was positioned in a flank position and the retroperitoneum was accessed by open technique. The retroperitoneum was accessed by a 1.5 cm long incision at the tip of the 12th rib. Balloon dilation of retroperitoneum was created and a 10 mm port was placed for laparoscope. 10 mm working ports were placed at the angle between the erector spina muscle and the lower border of the 12th rib and a 5 mm port was placed at the anterior axillary line under the guide of a 30° laparoscope. Gerota's fascia was opened by sharp dissection and a dissection on the posterolateral aspect of the inferior vena cava was carried out to find renal vessels. A total of 6 renal arteries and 4 renal veins were identified. The arteries were clipped separately by hem-o-lok clips and divided. The fused kidneys were mobilized completely and both ureters were identified. After mobilization of the fused kidneys and confirming that no additional blood supply was present, the renal veins were clipped and divided. The ureter going to the left side was divided after clipping it with hem-o-lok clips. The specimen was delivered intact by making a small incision (5 cm) in the inguinal region and a complete ureterectomy was carried out on the right side. The wound and port sides were closed.\nThe operative time was 148 minutes and blood loss was 35 ml. The patient resumed liquids orally 8 hours after surgery and remained in the hospital for 4 days. She is now on maintenance hemodialysis."
"A 25-year-old male, who was a known case of oculocutaneous albinism, presented with right inguinal swellings of six months' duration. He gave a preceding history of a similar lump in the right thigh, which was excised at the Chennai Government Hospital. On further interrogation, he gave a history of asymptomatic keratotic growths over the trunk and limbs, of one and a half years' duration. He also gave a history of photosensitivity and presence of white hair since birth.\nOn physical examination, he had typical features of oculocutaneous albinism in the form of totally depigmented skin with white hairs. He had photophobia, marked nystagmus and decreased visual acuity. His iris was non-pigmented and the pupillary area looked red. He had multiple keratotic papular and plaque lesions of 2mm to 2cm in size [], that were round to oval in shape, surrounded by a zone of erythema (actinic keratoses). Besides this, he had ulcerated and crusted lesions, up to 12 in number.\nThese ulcerated areas were indurated and some of them showed exophytic growths []. In the right leg, horny excrescences [] were seen over the keratotic lesions (cutaneous horns). The height of these horns was around 1.5cm.\nOn the basis of these clinical findings, a diagnosis of oculocutaneous albinism with actinic keratoses with multiple squamous cell carcinomas (with metastatic deposits in right inguinal region) and cutaneous horns was made.\nThe hemogram showed hemoglobin of 9 gm%. His total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count, and platelet counts were within normal limits. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the right inguinal region showed features of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. During follow up, it was found that he had been receiving radiotherapy (RT) in the right inguinal region for the past four months, with partial response. The overlying skin had healed, but still an indurated mass of about 2cm could be made out. He was also given chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU. Recently, he had been admitted to the surgery ward for excision of malignancies."
"A 25 year old male presented with two weeks of pain and swelling in his knees and ankles. The symptoms began in his right knee, after he experienced minor trauma. He sought emergency room care and was discharged home on ibuprofen after x-rays were negative. The pain and swelling then gradually spread to his left knee and right ankle. At a follow up orthopedic visit medication was continued. His symptoms worsened and impeded his ability to walk.\nOn day of admission, the patient also complained of new onset of some left MCP and DIP joint tenderness. He denied fevers, chills, shortness of breath, or headaches, but described progressive fatigue over a few weeks. He reported a sore throat six weeks prior, which was treated with amoxicillin for seven days. This was followed by diarrhea which resolved in one week. He was born in the United States, had no medical or surgical history, and no significant family history. He denied the use of cigarettes, alcohol, or illicit drugs. He stated he was currently sexually active with other men. There was no recent travel history, or sick contacts. He worked as a first grade school teacher.\nOn physical exam the patient had a temperature of 100.6F, synovitis and effusions in both knees L>R; right ankle and fifth DIP showed periarticular involvement (Figure ), tenosynovitis and there was swelling over the dorsum of the left hand. All involved joints were erythematous and exquisitely tender with a decreased range of motion. There was no evidence of a rash, spine tenderness or cardiac murmur.\nCBC demonstrated a WBC count of 16.4 (84% polys), platelet count of 1084K, and the ESR was 115. Knee arthrocentesis yielded cloudy yellow fluid (WBC 7,350 with 56% polys), with negative cultures. HIV, urethreal Gonococcal and Chlamydia testing, Rheumatoid Factor, ANA, C. difficile toxins, blood cultures, stool cultures, and throat cultures were negative. The ASLO titer was elevated at 518 (normal <200). EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia, with a normal PR interval. A transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable.\nDespite Sulindac 200 mg orally twice daily, the patient's symptoms persisted and a taper of prednisone starting at 40 mg/d orally was required for relief. After discharge he continued to respond well to corticosteroid therapy, and regained strength."
"The patient, a 25-year-old Moroccan housewife, gave a 5 years history of right lumbar pain. The physical examination revealed a non tender mass in the right flank and abdomen and hypertension (190/125 mm Hg), the rest of the physical examination was normal. Ultrasonography performed on the patient revealed a 15 cm size giant right renal cyst (figure ) and an additional computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated a simple right renal cyst measuring 17 × 20 cm, compressing the kidney (figure ). The complete blood cell count, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine level and urinalysis were normal.\nThe cyst was managed by laparoscopic surgery with transperitoneal access. Surgery consisted of decompression and excision of the anterolateral wall of the cyst. Administration of indigocarmine indicated no communication between the renal collecting system and the cyst. Cytologicexamination of the cyst fluid for tumor was negative. Pathologic examination of the specimen revealed a non complicated simple renal cyst. Postoperatively, the patient was normotensive (115/75 mm Hg) without medication."
"A 25-year-old man presented to our emergency clinic 6 h after a penetrating orbital injury with a brake lever in his right lower eyelid during a motorcycle accident []. Both eyelids were echymotic and edematous. On examination, he had no light perception in the affected eye and 20/20 in the fellow eye. The left eye was otherwise normal. In alternating light test, the right pupil was completely redilated (complete right afferent pupillary defect). Slit-lamp examination and fundoscopy could not be performed on the right eye due to patient discomfort. Computed tomography (CT) revealed two pieces of metallic intraorbital FBs, one of which was embedded in the zygomatic bone, and the second one located in posterior superior orbit []. A neurological examination showed no neurological deficits or signs of cranial penetration. With the impression of compressive optic neuropathy, we started intravenous methyl prednisolone and scheduled the patient for an emergency operation. With the patient under general anesthesia, the first portion of the metallic foreign body was removed from the lower eyelid with controlled and slow motions. On peritomy, we detected no corneal or scleral perforation. The inferior rectus muscle was disrupted. So, the anesthesiologist was informed of the situation and it was ensured that the anesthesia was deep. Then, we requested a zoom operating microscope, gently displaced the eye superiorly, retracted the Tenon's capsule from the globe with a Desmarres lid retractor (11 mm wide, Storz, E-989), and the area of Tenon's capsule where the muscle was expected to penetrate was inspected. Although the second part of the foreign body was located in the superior posterior orbit and its removal seemed to be difficult, we could fortunately find and remove it without significant resistance during exploration for the lost inferior rectus muscle via its tract in the inferior orbit []. All bleeding sites were touched up with light cautery and we continued to search for the lost muscle. Eventually, we could find the lost muscle and grasped it with a two-arm 5-0 vicryl suture. Then the suture was passed through the muscle stump at the insertion site and was tied. Conjunctiva and eyelids were sutured with proper materials. Four weeks after the surgery, the patient had no light perception, complete ptosis and a frozen eye due to multiple cranial nerve injury. Ocular examination showed normal anterior and posterior segments. The only positive findings were complete afferent papillary defect and optic atrophy in the right eye."
A 25-year-old male presented with episodes of complex partial seizures since 3 years. Past and family history was insignificant. His general and neurological examination was normal. Routine biochemistry revealed normocalcemia (10.1 mg/dl) and normal PTH (28 pg/ml). Plain CT head showed bilateral basal ganglia and cerebellar calcifications []. The patient was diagnosed to have Fahr disease[] and was started on oxcarbamazepine 600 mg/day. This patient has been seizure-free for the last 1 year.
"A 25-year-old female patient presented to the Department of Periodontics, Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Mangalore, in August 2004, with a primary complaint of mobility of right lateral incisor (12) and spacing between right lateral and central incisor. On examination, the right lateral incisor showed grade II mobility, with probing depth of 7.0 mm. After thorough oral prophylaxis, flap surgery was done, resulting in gingival shrinkage and exposed roots. Postoperative checkup after three months showed that the disease was under control, with good oral hygiene maintenance, but the patient was still concerned about the spacing and mobility. As the prognosis for further periodontal treatment was poor, the patient was advised to go for extraction of the tooth and replacement with a removable or fixed prosthesis. Since the patient was not interested in extraction and wanted to retain the tooth, she was referred to the Department of Conservative Dentistry for further esthetic management [-Pre-treatment]. A treatment plan was established involving the following steps:\nThe topography of the soft tissue defect was evaluated.\nThe color of the soft tissue was determined, to achieve the acceptable esthetics with tissue colored porcelain tints.\nShade and contour of gingiva and teeth were confirmed by curing the composite resin material over the lost tissue portion, without application of etchant and bonding agent.\nTreatment was also planned to close the diastema and restore the exposed root surface using composite resin."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented to Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, with a complaint of gap between her front teeth. The patient expressed her concern about her unesthetic appearance, because of the space between the central incisors. On examination of 11 and 21, the following were noted [-Pre-treatment].\nDiastema of about 3.0 mm incisally and 4.0 mm gingivally.\nGingival recession and root exposure on the labial surface of both 11 and 21.\nAbrasion of the labial surface of 11 and 21.\nOn periodontal examination, there was no bleeding on probing and absence of periodontal pockets."
"A 25-year-old male was found lying unconscious and brought out after breaking open the bathroom door after one hour. There was no evidence of seizures, vomiting, urinary and bowel incontinence or any kind of trauma at the time of incident and no history of fever, seizures, headache, and substance abuse in the past. Patient when brought was unresponsive. Pupils were 3.5 mm bilaterally reacting to light and plantar reflex was extensor on both sides. There was no neck rigidity, fever, and any cranial nerve deficit at the time of presentation. Patient's blood pressure was 90/50 mm Hg, which responded to fluid resuscitation. Systemic examination and investigations were normal. Level of consciouness improved over the next few hours, and he was managed with oxygen with a venturi mask, antiedema measures, and supportive treatment. MRI on the day of admission was normal. Patient's condition worsened on fourth day as his sensorium deteriorated and he developed flexor posturing. He was intubated and put on ventilatory support. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was normal. MRI at this time showed diffuse gyral swelling with hyperintense signal in bilateral basal ganglia and focal areas of diffuse restriction in bilateral frontoparietal cortex. Patient developed fever and chest radiograph showed opacities on the right side. He was managed on the lines of ventilator-associated pneumonia with antibiotics and was extubated on the tenth day of admission. Patient was discharged after 25 days of hospital stay. He had residual hypoxic damage in the form of persistent vegetative state and was discharged to a domiciliary care on request."
"A 25-year-old Turkish woman was admitted to our hospital in October 2008. She was suffering from abdominal pain, weakness, anorexia, and a 7-kg to 8-kg weight loss. It was discovered that she had a palpable abdominal mass three years prior to presentation. Physical examination revealed a 15 × 20-cm mass with regular contours in the her periumbilical region (Figure ). Four years prior to presentation, during her second pregnancy, she was admitted to a hospital because of abdominal pain, and an ultrasonographic examination then revealed an abdominal mass. As she did not want to terminate her pregnancy, she declined to undergo further examinations. After her pregnancy, she was told by her doctor that the mass had grown markedly. Because she was afraid of regularly visiting a doctor, she treated herself using alternative medicines such as eucalyptus tea, bay leaves and oleander. She claimed that drinking this tea made the mass shrink.\nHer laboratory results at the time of presentation were as follows: hemoglobin, 13 g/dl; white blood cell count, 10,500/cm3; platelets, 302,000/cm3; sodium, 135 mEq/L; potassium, 4.1 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen, 28 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.1 mg/dl; glucose, 110 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 36 IU/L; and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 41 IU/L. On abdominal X-rays, all of her intestines were seen shifted to the right. An intravenous pyleogram (IVP) showed a mass associated with her left kidney. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an 18 × 11 × 12-cm mass located in the middle of her left kidney and extending inferiorly, with diffuse contrast enhancement (Figures to ). The mass was consistent with renal cell carcinoma on CT. Owing to the mass, she develped left hydroureteronephrosis (Figure ). Her right kidney appeared to be within normal limits on the IVP and CT examinations. A laparotomy was performed via a midline incision. A 25 × 16 × 12 cm, 3380 g mass, arising from the left kidney and shifting the ureter proximally, was excised together with the left kidney (Figures , , ). Our patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day, with no signs of complications.\nMeanwhile, microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections at low power showed a neoplasm with a pseudocapsule and a tubulocystic pattern divided by thin fibrous septa. At higher magnification, the cells appeared to be round to polygonal with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, a regular round nucleus, and a central nucleolus. There were no foci of clear cell changes, necrosis, or mitotic figures."
"A 25 year-old unmarried male with Fitzpatrick skin type V presented with fluid-filled lesions which oozed clear fluid on the left side of the scrotum since the last six months. This fluid soaked his undergarments and affected his quality of life and profession. The lesion was first noticed when he was 15 years old and was surgically excised with primary closure of the wound. He was symptom-free for nearly seven years, only to notice fresh lesions since the last six months months. On examination, multiple, whitish, isolated vesicles were noted on the left side of the scrotum []. The differential diagnoses of lymphangioma circumscriptum, secondary lymphangioma (possibly due to infections such as filariasis or sexually transmitted infections) were considered. History, detailed examination, and serology ruled out filariasis and sexually transmitted disease.\nHistopathological exmaination confirmed the diagnosis of LC. Various treatment options were explained to the patient and radiofrequency current coagulation was chosen with his consent.\nUnder nitrous oxide anaesthesia, the vesicles were touched with the active ball electrode intermittently for 2–3 seconds []. This was done to prevent channeling of the radio waves along the spermatic cord. After the procedure, paraffin dressing was done and systemic antibiotics were started. In comparison to the previous case, the wound epithelialised in a week’s time. After one month, a few vesicles were noted, but the lymphorrhoea was absent. This was possibly because some of the lesions could not be visualised on the operation table with the patient in a supine position as they had emptied in the absence of gravity and hence, coagulation was incomplete. Over the next five months, a few more vesicles were observed with intermittent lymphorrhoea []. During this visit, a few vesicles were noted for the first time on the base of the penis [] which prompted a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation.\nMRI of the pelvis and the abdomen revealed multiple, dilated, lymphatic channels in the pelvis and the retroperitoneum extending up to the renal hilum superiorly, with similar smaller channels in the inguinal regions and the glans penis [Figures and ]. However, there were no mass lesions in the abdomen or the pelvis to account for the lymphectasia. A vascular surgeon’s opinion was sought, but a radical surgical option was ruled out due to the extent of the problem and communication with the normal lymphatics. Further repeat radiofrequency wave coagulation is being contemplated."
"A 25-year-old primigravida woman was referred for further investigation at the 24 weeks' gestation because of congenital cystic lung lesion. A review of the history revealed that the parents were both healthy. The mother did not report any past history of medical problems or recent infectious episodes. In addition, she had no exposure to teratogenic agents such as drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. The family history was also noncontributory. A level II sonographic examination revealed uniloculated, 40 × 37 mm sized, smooth contour congenital cystic lung lesion which originated from left hemi thorax with mediastinal shift causing decrease in lung volume (). The other organs were revealed as normal. After discussion with the family about possible outcomes pregnancy was continued. The pediatric surgical team was occupied after the confirmation of an antenatal diagnosed cystic lung disease to assist with antenatal counseling and postnatal management.\nAfter discussion, inutero drainage of the cyst was decided and a written permission form was taken from the family. Pulmonary drainage was made every week from 24 to 30 gestational weeks (). We made the procedure with sonographic guidance(LOGIQ 7 scanner GE medical system, Milwaukee, WI). Cyst was aspirated with 20 GA amniocentesis needle (Becton, Dickinson and Company, BD, USA). Genetic and histological analyses were made for cystic fluid. Genetic analysis was normal (46, XX). Histological analysis was reported as erythrocytes and degenerated epithelial cells. At 24th gestational week, cyst/ thorax rate was 3/8, after the 30th gestational week, this rate was decreased to 1/10. Steroid was given for lung maturation. After the 30th gestational week, the diameter of cyst was stabilized at 20 × 17 mm and mediastinal shift disappeared and the patient was follow-up to the birth every two weeks. Hydrops was not observed in inutero life. At the 39th gestational week, the female baby was born without any complication. Patient was operated due to overexpansion of the cyst at the postpartum forth day (Figures and ). After operation, the baby was discharged without any complication. The histological examination of the cyst was reported as bronchogenic cyst (cysts which were laid down with ciliated respiratory epithelium at the inner side and contained focal cartilaginous structures at the fibrous wall). She was 7 months old and healthy at the time of writing."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with a history of complete loss of teeth and wearing complete dentures since six months. The patient requested a fixed option for the lower denture. Clinical and radiological evaluation was performed []. It was decided to perform a single stage over denture implant placement. After induction of local anaesthesia, full thickness flap was reflected in relation to numbers 33 and 43. Two single piece over-denture implants (2.4 × 13 mm) were placed. After checking for primary stability, the flap was approximated and sutured with interrupted 3-0 Mersilk. The patient was instructed to discontinue wearing the lower denture and avoid trauma or pressure at the surgical site. Post-operative instructions were similar to the ones described in the first case. The sutures were removed after 10 days and the patient's existing lower denture was modified to receive the female part of the ball and socket over-denture prosthesis. The patient was recalled for review after two and four weeks and every three months. The clinical and radiographic appearances at six months and at one year show good aesthetic result and acceptable osseo-integration of the implants [Figure –].\nThe economic reality of implant-related prosthesis means that we may not be able to offer the required number of implants for perfect prosthetic rehabilitation especially if expensive bone regeneration procedures are required initially. In such instances, an implant supported over-denture may be an acceptable solution[] providing greater patient relief in terms of denture support.[]"
"A 25-year-old man presented with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was suffering from frequent attacks of asthma for 2 years, and Reynaud phenomenon for a few months.\nLaboratory findings included a leukocyte count of 13850/mm3 (Neutrophils: 4890 Lymphocytes: 1940 Eosinophils: 5980 (43%)), Hemoglobin = 16.7 g/dL and Platelet = 202000/mm3. C-reactive protein was negative and erythrocyte sedimentation ratio was 1 mm/h. Serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 322 IU/L. Liver function tests were normal. An excisional biopsy of inguinal lymph node showed lymphoid follicles with reactive germinal centers and well defined mantle zones, diffuse interfollicular eosinophilic microabscesses and apparent postcapillary venules, features associated with the diagnosis of KD (figure ). He was discharged on treatment with oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day. One month later a follow up Complete blood count (CBC) showed evident decrease in eosinophilia: Leukocyte: 12480/mm3 (Neutrophil: 10750 Lymphocyte: 1390 Eosinophil: 340 (about 4%)) and the Reynaud phenomenon was improved. Prednisolone was tapered and patient followed. Two months after tapering of prednisolone, he returned with 40% peripheral eosinophilia. He was prescribed with cyclosporine 200 mg twice daily orally.\nAfter starting cyclosporine, he complained of headache and vertigo and rise in blood pressure. Renal function tests were normal and we decreased the dose of cyclosporine to 50 mg twice daily. In a follow up visit three months after the administration of cyclosporine, eosinophilia was less than 1% and the patient's asthma was in control without use of bronchodilators.\nIn the next visit cyclosporine was discontinued and 15 days later he developed pruritic purple-red nodular lesions on his shins. Biopsy was taken from these lesions and cyclosporine 50 mg twice daily restarted. The result of skin biopsy was eosinophilic panniculitis with dense infiltration of lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils (predominantly eosinophils) in perivascular and periadnexal areas, as well as involvement of subcutis septa and nodules of fatty tissue and aggregates of eosinophils between dermal collagen fibers (figure ).\nHe is on a maintenance dose of 25 mg/day cyclosporine while there has been no more complaint of asthma attack, Reynaud phenomenon and skin lesions during the past 6 months."
"The patient is a 25years old male marble layer who presented to the eye clinic of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital on the 4th of April 2006 with a history of trauma and poor vision in the right eye of two weeks duration. He was using a machine to cut marble when a piece flew into his right eye resulting in severe pains, tearing and loss of vision. He used some traditional medication without relief.\nHe is not a known diabetic or hypertensive. There was no previous history of trauma to the eye or any other ocular disorder. He has no known drug allergy. He does not smoke but drinks alcohol occasionally.\nHis visual acuity was light perception in the right eye and 6/5 in the left eye. In the right eye, the conjunctiva was injected, there was a sealed corneal laceration of about 2.5mm representing the entry point of the foreign body at about the 2 o'clock position, the anterior chamber was shallow and there was some lens matter inferiorly. The pupil was mid-dilated, irregular, with posterior synechiae at about the 2 o'clock position. The lens was opaque. The fundus could not be visualized. The left eye was normal. The intraocular pressure, measured with the pulsair non-contact tonometer was 10mmHg in the right eye and 16mmHg in the left eye. An impression of sealed corneal laceration, traumatic cataract and retained intraocular foreign body in the right eye was made. Ocular ultrasound scan showed echogenic debris within the vitreous humour in the right eye suggestive of a vitreous hemorrhage and an acoustic shadow suggestive of a foreign body in the posterior aspect of the right eye (). He was placed on topical steroids to suppress inflammatory reaction and topical cycloplegics to rest the eye.\nHe was subsequently booked for right extracapsular cataract extraction with a posterior chamber intraocular lens implant under local aneasthesia with the aid of an operating microscope. During the surgical procedure, the cornea rapidly became cloudy after anterior capsulotomy with loss of the surface epithelium of the cornea. The lens matter had a brownish colour and the cornea had a brownish tinge. Despite irrigation of the cortical lens matter with balanced salt solution, the posterior chamber intraocular lens could not be inserted because of poor visibility. The incision was sutured. He was given subconjunctival injections of dexamethasone, depomethyl prednisolone acetate and gentamicin, and chloramphenicol ointment applied before the eye was padded.\nIn the first postoperative day, the visual acuity in the right eye was light perception and the corneal haze had cleared a bit. Slit lamp examination showed a defect in the posterior capsule through which the vitreous haemorrhage could be visualised"
"A 25-year-old man, an apprentice welder in a heavy steel industry, was returning home after watching a late-night movie show. When he was walking alone, before he realized two robbers followed and stopped him for money. Then the two robbers one on each side twisted his arms toward his back. They held his forearms in neutral and elbows in 90° flexion. His wrists were forced in full volar flexion, radial deviation, and pronation. The situation was simulated in the diagram []. While he was struggling to free himself, both the intruders were forcibly pronating his hands with the wrists kept in full volar flexion. He cried loudly because of severe shooting pain in hands and wrists. The intruders escaped from the scene shortly. His hands and wrists were swollen and very painful. Radiographs were obtained on the next day, and it revealed dorsal perilunate dislocation of both wrists [Figure and ]. Avulsion fractures of the posterior horn of the lunates, radial translation of the carpal bones and fracture of the tips of ulnar styloid processes were noticed [Figure and ]. The patient was treated by closed reduction under general anesthesia. Gentle traction was applied to the hand in slight volar flexion over the steadily held forearm in neutral position on both sides. The wrists, with traction on, were gently deviated radially and pronated. Then, the hands were supinated with continued traction while pushing the dorsally displaced carpi volarward. The dislocations got reduced without much difficulty []. A well-padded, below-elbow POP back slab was applied, keeping the wrist in 15°-20° volar flexion and 20°-25° ulnar deviation on both sides. After four weeks of immobilization, active exercises were started. The wrists regained almost full range of movements in about 10 weeks time. The patient was lost to further follow-up."
"A 25-year-old male reported to the department with a chief complaint of unsightly teeth due to generalized fluorosis []. A thorough oral prophylaxis was performed. This was followed by in-office vital bleaching for both the arches to lighten the discoloration. First, a gingival barrier was placed around the anterior teeth along the gingival contour and was light cured. A 35% hydrogen peroxide in-office vital bleaching gel was evenly applied onto the buccal surfaces of teeth []. This was done for 30 min, and alternate light curing was performed to enhance the bleaching process. All the instructions of the manufacturer were followed. The bleaching agent was then wiped off using a guaze, and patient was asked to rinse. A fluoride gel was then applied evenly onto the bleached teeth. This was followed by composite veneers for the maxillary arch [].[]"
"A 25-year-old Caucasian female with a history of type 1 neurofibromatosis was brought to our hospital with diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever following cesarean section for fetal distress. She was transferred to our institution within 18 hours of the onset of symptoms for surgical intervention in view of the ominous findings on computed tomography (CT) scan and endoscopy done at the peripheral hospital. She had not passed flatus or stool since surgery and denied hemetemesis, melena, shortness of breath, or chest pain. There was no history of tobacco or alcohol abuse, ingestion of corrosive substances or non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nOur patient appeared acutely ill and toxic. She had a temperature of 38.8°C, pulse of 120/min, blood pressure of 154/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24/min, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 2 L of oxygen. The cardiac and respiratory exams were otherwise unremarkable. Her abdomen was markedly distended. There was diffuse tenderness on palpation of the abdomen with no peritoneal signs. The cesarean section incision appeared clean with no tenderness or discharge. Bowel sounds were absent on auscultation. There were multiple neurofibromas on our patient's neck and anterior chest consistent with her diagnosis of neurofibromatosis. Her white blood cell count was 25,000/mm3, with 91% neutrophils. The initial electrolytes, amylase, lipase and liver function tests were within normal limits.\nCT scan of our patient's abdomen showed marked gastric dilation and air in the wall of the stomach along the entire greater curvature and portal venous system (Figures and ). There was marked dilatation of the small and large bowel. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) of our patient showed areas of diffuse mucosal congestion and extreme pallor as well as ulceration on the posterior wall and greater curvature of the stomach. Gastric biopsy revealed transmural necrosis. Streptococcus viridans was isolated from gastric biopsy. Blood cultures did not grow any pathogenic bacteria and nasogastric cultures were not obtained.\nOur patient was diagnosed with emphysematous gastritis and promptly started on intravenous clindamycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, nasogastric decompression and intravenous hydration. Total parenteral nutrition was initiated from day two and our patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit for three days. She improved with the above measures and tube feedings were initiated from day seven. Follow-up CT scan on day eight showed resolution of the gastric and portal venous air (Figure ). Our patient was finally discharged home on oral proton pump inhibitors on day 10. A follow-up EGD two months later showed no sequelae and our patient remained asymptomatic."
"A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department with multiple injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. On primary survey, he was hemodynamically unstable and had reduced bilateral air entry on chest auscultation and increasing respiratory distress. He was intubated and connected to a ventilator. Bilateral intercostal tube drainage was also performed. He was hypotensive (blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg). Resuscitation attempts were carried out using large amounts of intravenous (IV) fluids and, under continuous monitoring of the blood pressure and the respiratory rate, a contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scan of the thorax and abdomen was performed on a 40-channel multislice CT scanner (SOMATOM Sensation, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) after intravenous injection of 100 ml of non-ionic iodinated contrast material.\nThe patient had a cardiac arrest during the CT scan. The CT scan showed contrast pooling in the dependent portions of the superior vena cava (SVC) and the inferior vena cava (IVC), the hepatic veins, and the right renal vein [Figure –], with the formation of a blood-contrast level. The right chambers of the heart were opacified and there was also opacification of the pulmonary veins []. There was no contrast in the left heart chambers.\nThe patient had a left iliac wing fracture and multiple rib fractures, with extensive subcutaneous emphysema involving the thoracic wall."
"A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with an 8-month history of abdominal pain, distension, intermittent nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever. She had undergone abdominal surgery due to an accidental gunshot injury 10 years earlier. She had ascites on physical examination. Laboratory examinations were unremarkable and the upright abdominal X-ray was normal. Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed multiloculated ascites. A computerized tomographic (CT) scan showed ascites with thin intraascitic septations. The serum-ascites albumin gradient was 0.4 g/dL and the adenosine deaminase level of ascites was 49 U/l (upper limit of normal: 40 U/l). Moreover, the ascitic fluid was straw colored with protein >3 g/dL and total cell count of 550 /μL, consisting predominantly of lymphocytes (>70%). Tumor markers were with the normal range in serum but the ascitic CA-125 level was 336 U/mL (upper limit of normal: 16 U/mL). Cultures of the ascitic fluid and blood were negative for mycobacterial colonies. She refused to undergo laparoscopy, most likely due to her busy schedule. The findings were compatible with peritoneal tuberculosis and conventional antitubercular therapy was started. She returned to the hospital six months later. At the time of her second admission, she was well but her abdominal dullness and ascites were persisting. She had not taken any kind of medication for four months. Levels of serum electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, albumin, and total protein and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Repeated abdominal and pelvic CT scanning with contrast medium showed a large MC (). Exploratory laparotomy revealed a multiloculated thin-walled cyst arising from the colonic mesentery, adherent to the bowel loops and adjacent structures. During dissection of adhesions some of the locules ruptured, and about 5 liters of hemorrhagic fluid were suctioned. Histological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed an MC (). The postoperative course was very good and the patient was discharged."
"A 25-year-old male patient was admitted to intensive care unit in unconscious state with an alleged history of suicidal hanging by neck. Patient was rescued by his relatives within few minutes and shifted to hospital within 30 minutes. On examination his pulse rate was 126/min and arterial blood pressure was 90/64 mmHg. His pupils were bilaterally dilated and nonreacting to light. On auscultation chest was bilaterally clear with adequate air entry, but patient was tachypnoeic with respiratory rate of 32/min. Upper airway reflexes were present. Patient had intermittent decerebrating movements. Pulse oximetry revealed SpO2 60% and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed PaO2 54mmHg, PaCO2 28mmHg, pH 7.26, BE 9.2mEq/L and SaO2 64% on air.\nImmediately, his trachea was intubated orally with 8.5 mm ID cuffed endotracheal tube after thiopentone sodium 200 mg and succinylcholine 75 mg I.V. Patient was put on ICU ventilator for controlled ventilation with respiratory rate of 12/min, tidal volume 500mL, PEEP 5cm of H2O and FiO2 1.0. Patient was given pancuronium and midazolam. After one and half hour of therapy, SpO2 further dropped to 52% and patient developed frank pulmonary oedema with extensive fine crepts all over the chest and pink frothy secretions appeared in the breathing system. Controlled ventilation was continued with PEEP. He was given furosemide 60 mg and morphine 6 mg IV and repeated 6 hourly. X-rays of cervical spine AP and lateral view revealed no bony injury. After 2hours patient's ABG was satisfactory and revealed PaO294mmHg, PaCO229mmHg, SaO294% on FiO21. His chest condition was markedly improved after 12 hours of ventilation. His ABG analysis depicted PaO2114mmHg, PaCO235mmHg, pH 7.41, SaO298.4% on FiO2 0.5. He regained his consciousness. He was put on weaning mode of ventilation Assisted Spontaneous Breath(ASB) and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure(CPAP) with FiO2 0.4 for next 12 hrs. After 24 hours (2nd day) he was fully conscious. His SpO2 was 99% on FiO2 0.4. Chest X-ray AP view detected no abnormality. ABG analysis revealed PaO2 116mmHg, PaCO2 45mmHg, pH 7.49 and SaO2 99% on FiO2 0.4. On 3rd day his trachea was extubated Post extubation his SpO2 was 97% on FiO2 0.4 by facemask."
"The first patient was a 25 year old female who presented with abdominal pain and a palpable right abdominal mass. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 14 × 10 cm hepatic mass occupying segments 5,6,7,8 and compressing the right and middle hepatic veins. A right hepatectomy was subsequently performed. Histopathology revealed a primary hepatic leiomyosarcoma; immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA) and muscle specific actin (MSA). The surgical margins were negative and the tumour was classified as stage I sarcoma under the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification system. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy however the tumor recurred with distant metastasis and she passed away 22 months post resection."
"A 25-year-old Italian woman developed severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss over the course of 12 months from her first acute inflammatory episode characterized by conjunctival hyperaemia, interstitial keratitis and tinnitus. Before the admission, the patient had already experienced a 3-week regimen of oral prednisone (50 mg/day at regressive dosage) and dexametasone eye-drops with poor response. After the patient had been screened for a possible infectious origin of her symptoms and all other known causes of interstitial keratitis had been excluded (i.e. syphilis, sarcoidosis, leprosy, Lyme disease, viruses, hypersensitivity to drugs), diagnosis of typical CS was confirmed by positive anti-hsp 70 antibody[]. An immunosuppressive combination therapy was thus started following the reference protocol of our Centres for systemic autoimmune diseases[]. It consisted of pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide (400 mg IV once a month, for 6 consecutive months), intramuscular methotrexate (10 mg/sqm once a week with folic acid integration), oral cyclosporine (2.5 mg/kg of lean body weight per day) and prednisone (40 mg per week). Treatment controlled the relapsing ocular inflammation and stopped progression of the typical, ring-shape interstitial keratitis. It was also successful in achieving good control of accompanying symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and vertigo. The same treatment, however, gave poor results in controlling progressive hearing loss (figure ). An anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) molecule (adalimumab, 40 mg once a week subcutaneously) was then associated to prednisone and methotrexate for 6 months, but hearing loss continued to worsen. Following the patient's informed consent and approval of local ethics committee, Rituximab was infused as an ""off label"" adjuvant rescue treatment at the dosage of 500 mg iv/week for 4 consecutive weeks. The same regimen was repeated after 6 months, while oral prednisone at 10 mg every other day was maintained. A noticeable improvement in hearing function was documented by pure tone audiometry starting from the 28th day after the first drug infusion, mostly affecting the right ear (figure ). The pre-treatment CD19+ lymphocyte count was 73 cells/uL, which then decreased below the detectibly threshold after the infusion cycles. No other undesirable effects were recorded during or after therapy. At 12 months of follow-up, the audiometry curve was still better than pre-treatment levels and essentially unchanged in comparison to that shown in figure . Other previously experienced manifestations of the syndrome remained under control."
"A 25-year-old Chinese female coughed and had a fever 4 years ago. Since then she gradually felt chest distress, shortness of breath, nausea and weakness. In June 2006, she saw a doctor in Xiangya hospital out-patient clinic with pale complexion. Serious mitral stenosis with thickened leafs was found on a transthoracic echocardiogram accompanied by the dilation of left and right atrium and slightly dilation of right ventricle. She denied history of ischemic heart disease or prior cardiac catheterization. On physical examination, rough systolic ejection murmur and short diastolic rumble were heard at her apex area of heart. She was given an admission diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease. Following carefully examination, two mm split was observed in foramen ovale with left to right shunt. At surgery, ""vegetation"" was found free floating within the pericardial sac. However, the vegetation was invisible in the echocardiographic examination. Both the mitral valve and vegetation were carefully resected and sent for histological examination. She is alive and well 3 years after mitral valve replacement and foramen ovale closed.\nGross examination showed two recognizable slightly thickened valve leaflets, and an erythematous soft tissue fragment measuring 1.2 × 1 × 0.3 cm. Microscopically the soft tissue fragment consisted of epithelial strips arranged in glandlike structures admixed with numerous histiocytes, delicate fibrin strands, empty vacuoles suggestive of lipid droplets or adipocytes, with few neutrophils infiltration (Fig. and ). Occasionally, multinucleated cells could be observed. But mitosis was not observed in either cell population. Supporting stroma, including blood vessels, was not observed. The epithelial strips composed of cuboidal to low columnar cells, showing strong membranous immunostaining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (Fig. ) and cytokeratin 5/6, strong nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining for calretinin, and nuclear immunostaining for WT-1, supporting its mesothelial origin. The histiocytic component showed intense cytoplasmic immunostaining for CD68 (Fig. ) and lysozyme. Neither of cell components was stained with antibodies against S-100, synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CD34. The epithelial cells contained desomosome-like structures and microvilli in ultrastructure (Fig. ), while rich histiocytoid cells showed renal-shape nuclei and a few cytoplasmic filaments."
"A 25-year-old man presented with an acute abdomen with abdominal defence and rebound in the right lower quadrant and with severe crampy abdominal pain. The patient reported of blood mixed stool within the last four days. There was no history or family history of inflammatory bowel disease. A transabdominal ultrasound examination revealed an unclear circular mass with 5 cm diameter in the right upper quadrant. The subsequent CT-scan showed an invagination of the ascending colon with rectal contrast enema passing no further (Figure ); there was no critical extent of ceacal dilation evident on the CT-scan. No other intraabdominal pathology was detected.\nIntraoperatively, there was a firm intraluminal mass palpable in the ascending colon. A standard non-oncological right-hemicolectomy was performed. Intraoperative opening of the specimen revealed a circular, mucosa covered intraluminal mass acting as the leading point that caused partial mucosal invagination and obstruction. The stool filled saccular lesion had ulcerous areas visible on the mucosal surface (Figure ). Since there was no macroscopic evidence of malignancy, no further radical lymph-node dissection was made and the bowel continuity was re-established by an ileotransversostomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological examination revealed a cystic colonic duplication (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old female was introduced to our department seeking reconstruction of her left maxilla. At the age of 17, an ossifying cementoblastoma was diagnosed, and the patient underwent hemimaxillectomy. The orbital floor next to the maxilla had also been removed, which resulted in an enophthalmus and a collapsed cheek. The open connection between the nasal and oral cavities was treated with a removable prosthesis. The patient complained about the prosthesis size and its heaviness, which made chewing difficult and gave the speech a nasal tone. According to the patient, this was a massive reduction of her quality of life. To reduce the defect and to reconstruct the processus alveolaris, a microvascular fibula flap was selected for transfer. An individually premolded titanium mesh was used to reconstruct the floor of the eye. ""Backward"" planning was used to find the best position of the bony part. The position of the mandibula was predefined as the ideal position for the implants, which then predefined the ideal position for the transferred bone (Figure ). A computertomography (CT) scan of both legs was performed, and the necessary bony shape was virtually matched with the patient's left fibula (Figure ). To achieve the desired lengths and angles at the fibula's resection and split sites, a rapid prototyped template (figure ) was manufactured by Materialize© (Leuven, Belgium). To reconstruct the orbital floor, the intact site of the skull was mirrored, and the missing bony part was identified (figure ). Both parts were produced with rapid prototyping by IDEE© (Instrument Development Engineering & Evaluation, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands). The complete skull was then used to premold a titanium mesh, which was sterilized before surgery.\nDuring the operation, the incision made previously was used to open the site. As planned, the fibula and the individualized titanium mesh were placed in the sites selected preoperatively. Both were fixed with osteosynthesis screws of 2.0 diameter (KLS Martin Tuttlingen, Germany). The fibula was reanastomized to the vena jugularis interna and the arteria carotis externa. Wound healing was uneventful for the following three weeks. A CT scan obtained two days postoperatively demonstrated the accuracy of the fibula insertion (figure , ). The removal of the osteosynthesis material and the placement of dental implants will be performed six months after the operation."
"A 25 year-old male presented with bluish discoloration of the skin of five days' duration over the right hip. The patient had generalized bodyache five days ago for which he was administered intramuscular injection of diclofenac in the right hip. He then experienced severe, dull-aching pain in the region after injection and noticed bluish discoloration of the skin. The pain regressed spontaneously and there was no history of trauma, systemic or topical medication, or spontaneous bleeding from the gingiva or mucosa.\nOn examination, a well defined, nontender, large violaceous patch of 18 cm × 10 cm size with sharp geographic margins was found over the right hip []. The violaceous discoloration showed reticulate pattern and a similar smaller patch of 6 cm × 3 cm was found superomedial to the larger patch.\nBased on the history and clinical features, a diagnosis of Nicolau's syndrome was made and the patient was counseled about the condition and it's course. As the manifestations were mild, it was decided to observe him before starting any aggressive treatment. He was started on systemic antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection and was adviced to report after a week to check for any wound debridement. However, he was lost to follow-up."
"Patient 3 is a 25-year-old Irish Caucasian man diagnosed with CD colitis affecting the descending colon and rectum. He presented with active disease three years previously. Endoscopic evaluation revealed active rectal and colonic inflammation; his perineum appeared normal. His laboratory investigations confirmed active inflammation with a CRP of 38. His HBI was 10 at the time of presentation. He was treated initially with infliximab (5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks) after failed corticosteroid treatment. His disease responded rapidly. After he was in remission (after three doses of infliximab), he was switched to azathioprine and maintained on it. At a follow-up colonoscopy eight weeks after starting infliximab, we noted a stenosed anorectal canal with a quiescent colitis proximal to this. In the intervening three years, the patient has remained well. He recently represented with severe abdominal pain and constipation. His laboratory investigations were all normal (CRP <4), and his HBI was calculated to be 2. He was found to have an anorectal stenosis with hard stool proximal to this. He was treated with mechanical bowel preparation, and a follow up colonoscopy revealed a normal colon above a stenosed anorectal canal. He was subsequently treated with a balloon dilatation of his stricture. His CD remains in remission."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with a history of failed endodontic therapy in relation to tooth #11 and subsequent extraction 6 months prior to presentation to implant clinic. Clinical and radiologic examination revealed adequate hard and soft tissue dimensions for implant placement. A 3.0 × 15 mm single piece implant$ was placed in relation to #11 with good primary stability. In two weeks’ time patient presented with signs of peri-implant mucositis and mobility. The implant was removed the subsequent week.\nThe existence of a periapical pathology necessitated extraction of the tooth after failure of endodontic therapy. Although there was no radiographic evidence of any pathology in the periapical region at the site of implant placement, the previous periapical pathology[] had obviously not resolved. These sites may be considered to be at greater risk for implant placement and underlies the value of evaluation of the suspected sites with more sensitive investigative procedures such as CT scan. Economic considerations may preclude the use of such procedure routinely, but the suspected sites have to be evaluated with CT scan to avoid such retrograde implant failures."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to our department with the complaint of a fractured upper anterior tooth. History revealed trauma to the tooth 48 hours prior. On examination, an Ellis class III fracture with clinical pulp involvement was seen in relation to 21. The patient experienced pain on stimulus. The exposed pulp was bright red in color, which was an indication of patent blood supply to the pulp. The tooth responded normally to the electric pulp testing that was performed on the labial surface, which signified the healthy status of the pulp. Hence a partial pulpotomy procedure was planned with MTA."
"A 25-year-old caucasian lady presented to the Accident & Emergency Department of a general hospital complaining of acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating through to the back with associated nausea and vomiting. History, examination and biochemical analysis confirmed a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, Imrie score 1 []. Symptoms commenced after the third dose of Metronidazole therapy prescribed by the patient's dentist for treatment of a periodontal abscess. Amylase was 810 on admission and CRP was 70. CRP peaked to 248 on day 4 and rapidly declined thereafter. Relative negatives in the history included no other concurrent medications, no known drug allergies, alcohol consumption of 3–6 units weekly, and the patient was a nonsmoker.\nRelevant past surgical history included; (1) laparoscopic cholecystectomy (June 2006) for symptomatic treatment of suspected biliary colic although gallstones were not identified on imaging and (2) first episode of acute pancreatitis requiring hospital admission (Septmber 2009) following 5 doses to Metronidazole therapy prescribed for dental abscess. Ultrasound scan, Computed Topography of abdomen, and Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography all failed to demonstrate gallstones as potential aetiology at that time.\nOn this admission, a detailed history and biochemical evaluation excluded other risk factors for pancreatitis-gallstones, increased alcohol intake, recent ERCP, hypercalcaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, or viral infections. She was not taking any regular medications nor did she have any known drug allergies. Imaging by ultrasound scan reported previous cholecystectomy, normal common bile duct, and once again no gallstones were visualized. Magnetic Resonance Cholangio-Pancreatography also demonstrated normal intra- and extrahepatic biliary anatomy. These factors combined with past surgical history provided convincing evidence of Metronidazole as the most probable aetiological factor.\nSupportive management of IV fluid resusitation, analgesia, antiemetic and, nil per oral was instituted and Metronidazole therapy was immediately discontinued. Her clinical course was uncomplicated and amylase returned to normal on day 4 post admission (). She began to tolerate light diet on day 5 and was discharged on day 7."
"Mr. A, a 25-year-old male with a past medical history of bipolar disorder, was seen in an outpatient clinic 3 days prior to admission where he was started on oral acyclovir 800 mg 5 times a day and vicodin for a diagnosis of Herpes Zoster. He then presented to the emergency department with a one-day history of pruritis, redness, and blurry vision of the left eye. In addition, he stated the vesicular rash that was covering a portion of his right lower abdominal quadrant and right flank was worsening. The rash was accompanied by a severe burning pain. Outpatient medications included abilify, xanax, ambien, propranolol, and trileptal.\nAfebrile. Oropharynx: moist. Neck: supple. Heart: regular without murmurs. Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally. Thorax: unremarkable on admission but developed mild costovertebral tenderness on Day 3. Extremities: no edema. Skin: multiple crops of vesicles in different stages on the right lower abdominal quadrant and right flank consistent with T12 and L1 dermatomes. Initial exam by ophthalmologist was concerning for a corneal ulceration but subsequent examination revealed only corneal edema.\nAdmission S-Cr 0.9, Peak S-Cr 5.4 with BUN 31 (Normal Ranges for S-Cr and BUN are 0.6–1.2 mg/dL and 7–18 mg/dL). Urinalysis collected after rise in S-Cr was negative for RBCs, WBCs, granular casts, and eosinophils; it was also negative for crystals although polarizing light microscopy was unavailable to adequately look for crystals. Renal sonogram after S-Cr elevation was normal. HIV negative.\nThe patient was admitted to the general medicine wards but was started on IV acyclovir for herpes ophthalmicus by the ophthalmology team while still in the emergency department. He had not been on IV fluids when he received the IV dose of acyclovir. Subsequent workup was negative for herpes ophthalmicus and IV acyclovir was discontinued; unfortunately, by hospital Day 2, the patient's S-Cr had more than tripled since admission. Crystal-induced nephropathy was suspected and the patient was started on aggressive IV fluids. Although euvolemic, furosemide was added to maintain a urine output of at least 150 cc/hr. Further evaluation for other causes of acute kidney injury was unrevealing (see ) including a negative history for exposure to other nephrotoxic agents (NSAIDS, etc.) prior to, or during, his hospitalization. After peaking on hospital Day 3, the patient's S-Cr began to decline back to baseline over the following three days. The total amount of acyclovir given was a one-time dose of 800 mg IV and a total of 13.6 grams by mouth prior to the development of acute kidney injury. The timing of the acute kidney injury correlated with the IV dose (see for graphical representation)."
"A 25-year-old healthy male was noted to have an engorgement of the penis in the emergency room after 75 min of an uneventful reduction of dislocation of the right shoulder with 100 mg of propofol. He denied previous events of priapism, genitourinary disease, substance abuse, genital trauma and erectile dysfunction. He did not experience any sexual fantasies while he was on propofol. There were no features suggestive of hypercoagulable state or malignancy. He was not on any other medications, particularly antipsychiatric or antihypertensive agents or medicinal agents of alternative systems of medicine. Examination revealed an enlarged, edematous, erect penis with tense and tender corpus cavernosa with soft corpus spongiosum and glans. The scrotal contents and the prostate were normal. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Complete blood count, blood chemistry including liver function test and coagulation parameters were within normal limits.\nAs there was no resolution of priapism after 30 min of using the insulin syringe after successful aspiration of venous blood, 1 mL of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 was injected into each corpus. Complete detumescence occurred within 10 min. He was discharged and advised to have follow-up with the urologist and orthopedician. He was very reluctant to follow any type of post-reduction immobilization and presented again after 3 days with right shoulder dislocation. He received total doses of fentanyl 100 μg and propofol 50 mg for close reduction. He developed priapism within 15 min, which resolved without any intervention. There was no erectile dysfunction during follow-up of 9 months."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian gentleman presented to our clinic with a 12 month history of worsening dysaesthesia and paraesthesia affecting the thumb and index finger of his right dominant hand. There were no deficits in motor function affecting the right hand. The patient reported no medical antecedents, apart from an apparent ganglion of his right wrist.\nPhysical examination revealed a soft, non-tender, subcutaneous 2 × 1 cm mass over the volar aspect of the right wrist with no atrophy of the thenar eminence. Altered sensation in the distribution of the median nerve of the right hand was detected by static two point discrimination and the use of the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. Tinel's sign and Phalen's test were both positive. Somatic examination did not reveal any signs of neurofibromatosis or lymph node tumefaction.\nNerve conduction studies inferred a reduction in median nerve conduction at the wrist. Radiographs of the hand and wrist did not show any ectopic calcifications or bony abnormalities. The MRI scan revealed an 18.5 × 9.7 mm volar mass within the carpal tunnel which was initially thought to be a ganglion cyst compressing the median nerve (Figures and ). On the basis of this surgical exploration and decompression was recommended.\nUnder general anaesthetic, a longitudinal incision was made at the wrist. After dividing the transverse carpal ligament a grossly enlarged median nerve was observed. To facilitate exploration, the incision was extended up to the middle of the forearm and distally into the palm. The nerve was yellow and pink with longitudinal fatty streaks within the nerve fibres. These fatty streaks extended from the distal third of the forearm to the distal edge of the carpal tunnel (Figure ). Excision of the adipose tissue between the nerve fascicles was impossible due to the risk of causing neuronal injury. A biopsy of the nerve was taken and the carpal tunnel was successfully decompressed.\nHistological examination revealed non-neoplastic fibrofatty elements infiltrating the perineurium with mature fibrous and adipose tissue separating nerve fascicles. There was no neural hypertrophy. A histological diagnosis of LFH was made. The postoperative period was unremarkable and the patient experienced a complete resolution of his symptoms. At the 6 month follow-up appointment he remained asymptomatic."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with a history of sudden visual loss in her right eye 5 years ago, intermittent jerking of the body for 10 months, insidious onset of weakness of the left upper limb 10 months back, weakness of the left lower limb 8 months back, sudden diminution of vision in the left eye 2 months back, and urinary incontinence for 2 weeks. On examination, she was conscious, not oriented to place or time, and was able to identify only her husband. Her speech was interrupted due to myoclonic jerks, which involved the whole body (the left side more than the right), with slow relaxation every 8–10 s. Power was 4/5 on the left side, deep tendon reflexes on both sides were 3+, and the plantars were downgoing. An MRI study of the spine [Figures and ] and brain [Figures and ] was performed. MRI of the brain showed large confluent hyperintensities involving the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe white matter and the right thalamus on T2W [] and FLAIR [] images. The signal abnormality was asymmetric – being more widespread on the right side – and extended from the subcortical white matter to the periventricular white matter. No definite evidence of mass effect or volume loss was evident. MRI of the spine showed a central cervical cord hyperintensity extending from C3 to C7 [Figures and ]. Although brain MRI was suggestive of the diagnosis of SSPE, the presence of the cervical cord signal led to a battery of investigations for other neurologic diseases that can cause signal changes in both the brain and the cervical spine on MRI. Further investigations included EEG (which revealed periodic discharges every 3–5 s) and serum and CSF anti-measles IgG antibody levels (which gave test values of 2.734 and 1.396 as against control values of 0.524 and 0.258, respectively). Diagnosis of SSPE was made after extensive exclusion of other diseases and on the basis of the clinical presentation, EEG, anti-measles antibody titers, and characteristic MRI brain findings."
"A 25-year-old right hand-dominant male underwent arthroscopic elective superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) repair for a superior and posterior inferior labral tear.\nGeneral anesthesia and an interscalene block with 24 ml of 0.75% ropivucaine and 140 µg clonidine was used. The patient was set-up in the standard beach-chair position as outlined in Case 1. Standard prep and drape was used with 4.0 kg of longitudinal traction and the horseshoe head rest. Standard posterior and anterior working portals were used.\nFindings were of extensive labral pathology and a large bony Hill Sach’s lesion was noted with a small bony anterior glenoid deficiency with deficient labral remnant.\nExtra working portals were created and the posterior labrum and superior labrum were repaired arthroscopically with a range of bioabsorbable suture anchors.\nThe patient was thus in this position for the full 125 min of the set up and operation. Before draping the patient, the same care was taken to ensure that positioning of the head and neck was in the neutral position pre- and peri- operatively. In recovery, it was noted that the patient complained of pain in the posterior auricular distribution, which commenced about 30 min postoperatively.\nPostsurgical review in the ward the next morning did not reveal discomfort. The patient was discharged the following day and seen at 2 weeks, with complaints of numbness and dysesthesia in the greater auricular nerve distribution on one side. This continued with reducing pain over 3 months, with the altered sensation resolving 6 months later without deficit."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented to gynecology outpatient department with the history of infertility. She was married for 3 years. Past history revealed that before marriage she had conceived and underwent medical termination of pregnancy by dilatation and curettage at 8 weeks of gestation. Following the event, her menstrual history was normal. She did not have any other significant complaints.\nThe couple was subjected for infertility workup. The semen analysis of the husband was normal. Evaluation of the female partner by transvaginal ultrasonography revealed an echogenic area in the uterine cavity measuring 1 cm×1 cm suggestive of retained products of conception. The patient was subjected for a diagnostic hysteroscopy.\nHysteroscopy was done using rigid hysteroscope (Karl Storz) with saline as distending media. Endometrial cavity revealed multiple small, hard bony spicules, which were removed using hysteroscopic forceps and submitted for histopathological study.\nGrossly the bits were multiple, small, bony in texture, and totally measured about 2 cm×1 cm in dimension. Multiple scanty soft tissue bits were included in the biopsy material. The bony bits were kept for decalcification.\nThe hematoxylin and eosin stained paraffin sections showed trabeculae of woven bone with non-hematopoietic bone marrow. Endometrial tissue was scanty and predominantly composed of tubular glands with scanty stroma. No secretory activity was noted in the endometrial glands. Inflammatory reaction, necrosis, and products of conception were absent. No evidence of granuloma was seen.\nThe serum calcium was 9.2 mg/dl and phosphorus was 3.7 mg/dl. Both were within the normal range.\nA histological diagnosis of osseous metaplasia of endometrium was made [].\nFurther evaluation could not be done as the patient was lost for follow up."
"A twenty-five-year-old woman presented at our Institute with three months history of cough with scanty expectoration, progressive dyspnoea and chest pain. She migrated from Nepal to India along with her husband and was working as a part-time domestic helper. There was no history of diabetes, hypertension, or any other significant disease. She had weight loss by 4 kg over the last three months, presently weighing 40 kg. She had dyspnoea at rest, respiratory rate 28/min, and pulse rate 120/min. She had wide spread crackles over bilateral lung fields. No significant cardiovascular system or ECG finding was observed. No cause of chronic alveolar edema could be elicited. There was no clinical evidence of any gynecological involvement. No BCG scar was seen and she could not recall any BCG vaccination. Her complete blood count, routine biochemical tests including blood sugar and urinalysis were within normal limits. Her serum was non-reactive for HIV-antigens on two different occasions. Chest radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities having irregular fluffy margins with a pattern of coalescence and presenting in butterfly distribution. The blunting of right CP angle was also seen []. The tuberculin test read at 48 h showed an induration of 28 mm. The microbiological evaluation of her sputum showed no pathogen. CT scan of thorax [] was also suggestive of alveolar opacities, showing the air-bronchogram within alveolar opacities and presence of right pleural effusion. Thoracentesis and the evaluation of pleural fluid showed exudative effusion but leading to no further differentiation. The various differential diagnoses considered [] were individually evaluated for by using fiberoptic bronchoscopy, detailed systemic history, thorough clinical examination and appropriate relevant investigations. The BAL specimen and brush specimen obtained through the fiberoptic bronchoscope were negative for any malignant cells and bacterial, mycobacterial or fungal infection using conventional methods. CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of the pulmonary lesions was carried out and that revealed epitheloid cells granuloma [] and the Z N stain for acid-fast bacilli was positive [] confirming the tuberculous lesion. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) investigation in specimen from FNAC of lung lesions and BAL sample confirmed tubercular etiology. She was diagnosed to have pulmonary tuberculosis and was given WHO Category-I anti-tubercular treatment (2H3R3Z3E3/4H3R3). She had a favorable response with anti-tubercular chemotherapy."
"A 25-year-old, full term, second gravida was admitted in second stage of labour with severe anaemia (Hb: 5 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia. She had no previous antenatal reports. She was haemodynamically stable until the normal vaginal delivery, when she lost 1 l of blood. Two hours later, she developed respiratory distress, haemodynamic instability, drowsiness and became unconscious. It was attributed to blood loss and she was resuscitated with 1 l of colloids and 2 units of whole blood, but she remained unresponsive, was intubated and put on ventilator for elective ventilation (SIMV mode). She also developed bleeding from nose and gums. Her platelet count had dropped to 28,000/mm3, but prothrombin time and INR (International normalized ratio) were normal. Platelet antigen typing showed raised platelet-associated immunoglobulins (6.0, reference range 0–4) suggesting idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed subdural haematoma (Lt temporal) with mass effect. Six units of platelet concentrate were transfused. The subdural haematoma was managed conservatively in view of severe symptomatic thrombocytopenia and the patient was managed with Mannitol 1 g/kg, Dexamethasone 10 mg/kg and Glycerol. She regained consciousness and was extubated after 48 hours. Repeat CT after 10 days showed no mass effect with resolving haematoma which resolved completely after 15 days."
"A 25-year-old female reported to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with the chief complaint of a swelling of the right cheek with right-sided nasal obstruction since 8 months. Intraoral examination revealed a firm well-defined swelling extending from the upper right central incisor to the second premolar of the same side. The swelling was nontender. The right upper cuspid was missing and 11, 12, 14 and 15 were vital. The overlying mucosa was nonulcerated and pink in color. There was no evidence of oro-nasal and oro-antral communication, and the palatal mucosa was intact.\nComputed tomography scan demonstrated a large lesion of the right maxillary sinus measuring 6 cm × 5 cm in dimension []. There was expansion and thinning of the bony sinus wall, which was absent at places. An unerupted maxillary canine was seen near the mesial wall []. Diagnostic aspiration was performed and about 15 ml of straw-colored fluid was aspirated. On the basis of the clinical and radiographic findings, the differential diagnosis of dentigerous cyst, AOT and odontogenic keratocyst was made. A small bony window of approximately 5 mm × 5 mm was made within the portion of labial plate that corresponded to the upper right central incisor. An incisional biopsy was performed and a histological diagnosis of dentigerous cyst with nonkeratinized epithelial lining and fibrous connective tissue was made []. The mass was enucleated completely along with the embedded canine and the specimen was submitted for histopathological examination [Figures and ]. Gross examination revealed a cystic lesion measuring 6 cm × 5 cm × 4 cm []. The cyst wall demonstrated tan-colored nodular thickenings in some areas []. Majority of the lesion comprised of reduced enamel epithelium two to three cell thick supported by a bland loose connective tissue stroma. Sections of the solid tissue containing histological characteristics of AOT were found in the fibrous capsule of the dentigerous cyst []. The tumor was composed of nodules of various sizes consisting of cuboidal or columnar epithelial cells that formed nests or rosette-like structures. In certain areas, cubical cells were arranged in a cribriform or lace-like pattern showing cords of cells with associated hyaline material surrounded by a loose oedematous vascular stroma []. This epithelium was continuous with the cuboidal or columnar cells of the odontogenic epithelium, forming nests or rosette-like structures []. In other areas, tubular structures enclosing a central space lined by columnar cells were also seen []. A diagnosis of AOT located in the fibrous capsule of the dentigerous cyst was made. The postoperative course was uneventful and, 6 months later, there were no signs of recurrence."
"A 25-year-old female with no history of any chronic medical illness, presented with complaints of lower backache, stiffness and weakness in both lower limbs, and tingling sensation in the right lower limb for 1½ months. On examination, the power was 3/5 in both lower limbs proximally and 2/5 and 1/5 distally in the right and left lower limbs, respectively. Sensations were decreased below the waist.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a heterogeneously enhancing 25 mm × 19 mm extradural lesion at D5 vertebral body level, causing displacement of the cord to the right and severe cord compression [].\nIntraoperatively, D5 level extradural soft-tissue lesion was seen, which was granular and appeared to have a rich vascularity.\nMass was received in neuropathology department in multiple small bits and fragments aggregating to 2.5 cm × 2 cm × 0.5 cm. Bits were grayish-white in color and firm in consistency. Few bits appeared bony hard.\nOn microscopic examination, multiple biopsy bits showed a chondrogenic tumor with cells arranged in lobules in abundant myxoid matrix. The neoplastic chondrocytes were large in size and had bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei. Few binucleate and multinucleate forms were also seen along with occasional atypical mitoses. There was permeation and destruction of the host bone, and the tumor was seen invading the marrow spaces. Few foci showed high cellularity. No osteoid production was seen by the tumor. The tumor was diagnosed as Chondrosarcoma – Grade II [Figures –]."
"A 25-year-old man presented in 1988 with a 6-month history of progressive numbness, tingling, generalized fatigue, and weakness in the upper and lower limbs. Examination showed grade 4 weakness of elbow, wrist, hand, hip flexor, hamstring, and quadriceps muscles and grade 3 power of more distal muscles in the legs. He had a coarse postural tremor, areflexia, and flexor plantar responses. Sensory testing showed a glove-and-stocking hypesthesia to pinprick and temperature extending to the mid-forearms and knees. Joint position was impaired at the toes and fingertips, and vibration sense was impaired distally in the toes. He had mild bilateral foot-drop gait and walked on a broadened base. He could not perform a tandem gait and the Romberg test was positive. He could not walk on heels or toes.\nNCS showed demyelinating polyneuropathy with secondary axonal loss (Table ). Electromyographic examination showed fibrillation potentials, monophasic positive sharp waves, and reduced recruitment indicating axonal loss. The patient was diagnosed with CIDP and treated with prednisone and azathioprine. He improved clinically over the next 6 months with mild residual weakness, sensory loss, and areflexia, but NCS were unchanged. By 1990, he had more clinical improvement, with improved NCS as shown in Table with increased compound muscle action potential amplitudes and motor nerve conduction velocities as well as decreased distal motor and F wave latencies.\nBy mid-1992, he was asymptomatic with a normal examination apart from persistent areflexia. By 1993, he was able to play hockey, and prednisone was stopped. As azathioprine was slowly tapered to 25 mg daily by 1995, he remained well clinically, but F wave latencies increased (Table ). This increase in F wave latencies heralded a clinical relapse in 1996 that responded completely to a higher dose of azathioprine, but the NCS improved more slowly by 1998, although not fully, and he relapsed twice more as azathioprine was tapered.\nBy 2005 he felt 95–100% of normal, ran 5 miles daily, and worked full time. His upper limb reflexes were normal and he had sluggish knee reflexes. Strength was intact and he had mild distal sensory loss of pinprick. Azathioprine was slowly tapered and stopped in 2011, and by 2012 his NCS were normal (Table ). He relapsed in 2016 following a respiratory tract infection and responded to IVIG and azathioprine after 10 months when the IVIG was discontinued, although the NCS were unchanged. By late 2018, the patient was 100% of normal with normal strength, hypoactive reflexes in the upper limbs and absent reflexes in the lower limbs, as well as normal sensation and gait. NCS were normal and azathioprine was discontinued in 2019."
"A 25-year-old male of Asian ethnicity, with a past medical history of constipation, presented\nto us with complaints of fever, nausea, vomiting and loose stools. Four days after the primary\ncomplaints, he started having generalized abdominal pain with hematochezia. He denied any\nhematemesis, yellow discoloration of eyes and skin, shortness of breath, melena and palmer\nerythema. Empirically, after reviewing the initial labs, the patient was started on intravenous\nCeftriaxone, intravenous proton pump inhibitor and fluids along with antiemetic and antipyretic\nfor his fever, nausea, vomiting and loose stools.\nThe physical examination was unremarkable except for tense abdomen and abdominal distention,\ntenderness was present on deep palpation of lower abdomen and bowel sounds were increased.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: Hemoglobin: 13.7 gm/dl, white cell count: 2500 cells\nper microliter with differential count of neutrophils: 51% and lymphocytes: 35%, Platelet count:\n58,000 cells per microliter of blood, Urea: 27.4 mg/dl, Creatinine: 0.76 mg/dl, serum Sodium 131\nmEq/L, serum Potassium: 2.1 mEq/L, serum Chloride: 100 mEq/L, International Normalization Ratio\n(INR): 1.9, Total Bilirubin: 0.99 mg/dL with direct bilirubin of 0.79 mg/dL. Blood Culture and\nsensitivity were sent and the patient was started on potassium supplements and vitamin K\ninjections. The differential considerations included Enteric fever, Shigellosis, infectious\ngastroenteritis, and Ulcerative Colitis. Ultrasound abdomen was planned which showed\nhepatosplenomegaly. X-ray chest P-A view (erect) was done to look for a sign of Intestinal\nperforation and it turned out to be normal (no air under the diaphragm) (). X-Ray abdomen (supine and erect) was also done in which coffee\nbean appearance of sigmoid colon was found, making a suspicion of sigmoid volvulus ( and ).\nComputed Tomography Scan (C.T) was ordered which showed gas-filled loops along with omega sign\nconfirming the diagnosis of Sigmoid Volvulus (\nand ). Blood culture and sensitivity report showed\ngrowth of salmonella typhi, which was sensitive to meropenem and azithromycin only, confirming\nthe diagnosis of enteric fever. So, the final impression of sigmoid volvulus was made as a\ncomplication of enteric fever, which is a rare finding in the literature.\nGeneral Surgery department was taken on board and they planned for untwisting of Sigmoid Colon\nalong its mesentery and colonic decompression was also done. The patient was moved into the\nrecovery room and ultimately into the general floor, managed for typhoid fever medically and\nthen discharged. Follow up on two weekly bases in medicine and surgery ambulatory clinics was\nplanned."
"A 25-year-old male presented with diminution of vision after recovering from unconsciousness which was preceded by a bright flash-like event nearby on a rainy day. He stated that initially after recovering he had loss of vision for 4–5 hours, which gradually improved but never fully recovered. On ocular examination, his best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/18 bilaterally (OU). The anterior segment findings were normal. Foveal reflex was found to be dull OU (). OCT revealed OU parafoveolar cysts (PFC). The patient was treated with topical steroids and asked to follow up weekly. The PFC decreased over time and eventually resolved by the end of 3 months, with BCVA of 6/12 OD and 6/9 OS."
"A 25-year-old female came in with the chief complaint of a sudden loss of vision in OD following exposure to a lightning strike. She was standing near a window on a rainy day when lightning struck the ground about 5 m away from her.\nFollowing the incident, she was unconscious for about 30 minutes. On examination, her best corrected vision was hand movement in OD and 6/9 in OS. IOP was 13 and 12 mmHg g, respectively. OD had lid edema, mild conjunctival congestion, corneal edema with descemet’s membrane folds, 2 + cells, and flare in anterior chamber (AC); relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present, the lens was clear and posterior segment details were not visible. OS was normal. The patient was treated with topical steroids and cycloplegic. After 5 days BCVA was HM, the cornea was clear, AC was quiet, RAPD was still present, vitreous was clear, disc and retinal vessels were normal but a foveal cyst was present in RE. OCT showed a large intraretinal cyst at the fovea with a thin overlying tissue suggestive of an impending macular hole (). Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed mild diffuse hyper fluorescence in the foveal area with no leakage (). The probable cause of poor vision in RE was a foveal cyst and optic neuropathy. On follow-up after four months, posterior subcapsular cataract was present, the disc was pale, there was no change in the size of the foveal cyst and inferior RD was noted. No retinal breaks were seen, posterior hyaloid was intact, and shifting fluid was present with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mottling, suggestive of exudative RD (). The vision was still HM. The patient deferred any further treatment in view of poor visual prognosis."
"A 25-year-old male presented to us with insidious onset of difficulty in walking and instability while walking later associated with handgrip weakness of 1-year duration which was gradually progressive. He could not recollect any history of previous trauma or fall or any history of previous neck pain. He had difficulty in carrying out routine activities of daily living which was also affecting his employment. He had no other comorbidities. On examination was found to have signs of cervical myelopathy with severe wasting of thenar and hypothenar muscles. His gait was wide-based, spastic, and unsteady. His left upper and lower extremities had muscle weakness of Grade 3 or 4 of 5. He had symmetrical hyperreflexia, as well as positive Hoffmann and Babinski signs bilaterally. He was Nurick Grade 3 at the presentation and modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score of ten with sensory deficits in the upper limb and no micturition difficulty. Plain radiographic assessment was suggestive of atlantoaxial instability with an increased atlantodens interval []. Computed topographic scans (CT) were also done which confirmed the atlantoaxial instability with the presence of a dystopic OO near the basion but not fused to the clivus [Figures and ]. MRI scans were carried out which were suggestive of mechanical cord compression and cervical myelopathy []. Dynamic lateral neck radiographs were suggestive of the partial reduction of the atlantoaxial instability. Other serological investigations were unremarkable.\nAfter confirmation of the diagnosis of dystopic OO, posterior instrumentation in the form of C1 lateral mass screws and C2 pedicle screws were planned. To achieve appropriate atlantoaxial reduction and stability special polyaxial screws of 4-mm diameter with reduction tabs (similar to the ones found in reduction pedicle screws) were used. Posterior stabilization was performed with the standard midline approach and necessary instrumentation performed with the screw and rod construct [Figures and ]. This was followed by excision of the posterior arch of atlas. We have used autologous iliac crest cancellous graft retrieved from the posterior iliac crest and put in the atlantoaxial joints posteriorly after instrumentation to achieve bony fusion. Postoperative CT scans were suggestive of adequate stabilization and reduction of atlanto-dens interval along with maintenance of the clivus canal angle []. Postoperatively, patient had an uneventful outcome and was mobilized with the help of philadelphia collar. At 14-months follow-up patient had reduced spasticity along with improved mJOA score of 16 as compared to preoperative score of 10."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with the chief complaint of a slowly enlarging, painless swelling on the upper lip on the right side for 2 years. The onset of the lesion was gradual without any associated injury. Her medical history was noncontributory. Extraoral examination revealed diffuse, mobile, firm, nontender nodule on the anatomical area enclosed between right commissure, right nasolabial fold laterally and philtrum medially []. Overlying skin was free. No regional lymphadenopathy was noted. Intraoral examination revealed a solitary, well-defined, round to ovoid, firm, nontender, nonfluctuant and nonpulsatile nodule (1.5 cm × 2.0 cm) on the upper right labial mucosa in relation to 13, 14 and 15 showing prominent superficial vascular markings []. Based on clinical findings, a provisional diagnosis of benign salivary gland neoplasm was made. Differential diagnosis included canalicular adenoma, PA, fibroma, neurofibroma and lipoma.\nExcisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia after obtaining written informed consent from the patient. The gross specimen was encapsulated, rubbery and resilient in consistency measuring about 1.5 cm × 2.0 cm × 1.0 cm. Cut surface was glistening with a homogeneous tan white color containing multiple microcysts [].\nHistopathological examination of the sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed well-circumscribed lesion surrounded by fibrous capsule, composed of neoplastic glandular epithelial cells and myxoid stroma []. High-power magnification showed proliferation of glandular epithelial cells in sheet-like and duct-like pattern. The ducts were peripherally lined by cuboidal luminal cells and abluminal myoepithelial cells having hyperchromatic nuclei []. Lumens of the ducts were filled with periodic acid-Schiff stain-positive mucinous material []. Multiple small to large microcysts resembling cribriform pattern were noted at places []. The stroma predominantly consisted of myxoid zone [] interspersed with hyalinized area of dense collagen fibers []. Focal area of keratinization in concentric ring-like fashion was observed suggestive of squamous metaplasia []. Diffuse area of clear cells with inconspicuous nuclei was also noted in close vicinity to the myxoid zone []. Thus, although the overall histopathologic features were suggestive of PA, owing to cribriform pattern, keratinized area and clear cells, adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) and polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) need to be considered in the differential diagnosis.\nThe patient was followed up over a period of 12 months and no recurrence was noted."
"A 25-year-old male presented at our department with a painless nodular lesion incidentally discovered 5 months earlier. Clinical examination showed a right-seated mass, well-defined, non-tender and non-fluctuant, involving the body of the tongue on the right side and measuring 1.5 cm × 1 cm []. Ultrasound examination of the tongue and neck has been performed, and they revealed reactive inflammatory lymph nodes excluding a malignant disease. The patient appeared to be in the overall good health. He underwent incisional biopsy of the mass reporting diagnosis of “granular cell tumor.” Subsequently, a magnetic resonance imaging examination (MRI) was demanded, which reported “a soft-tissue mass in the right side of the tongue showing contrast enhancement in T1 sequences” []. The tumor was totally excised under general anesthesia, and histopathological examination confirmed the biopsy diagnosis. In particular, hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections revealed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the overlying stratified squamous epithelium, circumscribing proliferation of monomorphic elements with abundant granular cytoplasm []. No mitotic figures were observed. At immunohistochemistry, all neoplastic cells were S-100 and C68 positive, Ki67 <10% []. Surgical margins were free from disease. All these findings confirmed the diagnosis of Abrikossoff's tumor of the tongue. The patient was first examined 1 week later and again with a regular follow-up after 1, 3 and 6 months []. So far, no sign of recurrence has been noted, as highlighted by postoperative ultrasound and magnetic resonance examination []."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to the department with traumatic dental injury. On examination, complicated crown-root fracture of mandibular left first premolar was evident. Fracture line was visible on clinical examination as well as on intraoral periapical radiograph. The coronal segment was mobile and the tooth was tender. Owing to coronally located fracture line and patients desire to retain natural dentition, it was decided to complete endodontic treatment, followed by gentle orthodontic extrusion to enable full esthetic rehabilitation.\nEndodontic treatment was completed following a similar protocol as described for Case 1. After obturation of root canal, the mobile coronal segment was removed, postspace was prepared, and orthodontic wire 0.7 mm in diameter, hooked at one end was cemented into the canal.\nAfter fabricating an attachment (post) made up of stainless steel wire of 0.7-mm diameter. Orthodontic extrusion was started from hooked end using helical coiled 0.014 inch wire attached to canine and molar. Helix was tied to the hooked end of post with ligature wire. After desired extrusion was achieved, the tooth was stabilized with stainless steel wire for 8 weeks followed by prosthetic rehabilitation []."
"A 25-year-old male from Northwest Puerto Rico, with past medical history of ocular albinism, presented to the outpatient clinic to establish care. Patient reports that as a child, he experienced episodes of epistaxis and easy bruising, requiring hospitalization. He was worked up for coagulation disorders such as hemophilia, which were negative. He also reports requiring blood transfusions as a child. Patient denied any family history of bleeding disorders. His teenage years and early adulthood years were uneventful as he did not require hospitalizations or transfusions.\nIn 2014 at the age of 22, he had a dental surgical procedure performed and reported excessive bleeding for 2 days after the procedure. The patient was hospitalized at that time to undergo a thorough evaluation. A diagnosis of HPS was considered, based on the external and ocular features of albinism, visual disturbances, and bleeding diathesis. A blood smear specimen was sent to a special coagulation laboratory at the Mayo Clinic for platelet electron microscopic studies and revealed the platelets had virtually no dense bodies. This finding in conjunction with other platelet EM findings was consistent with a variant of HPS ( and ).\nHe remained stable up until 2016 when he experienced epistaxis and hematemesis. No blood transfusion was required during the hospitalization. He was advised to establish care with a primary care provider and to see a hematologist.\nDuring his initial hematology evaluation, a special genetic test from GeneDx was ordered to possibly confirm the diagnosis of HPS in this patient. The result was positive homozygous for 3.9 kb deletion in the HPS3 gene. The 3.9 kb deletion in the HPS3 gene identified in this analysis could occur in persons of any heritage but is particularly common among individuals of Puerto Rican ancestry who originate for the central region of the island. Homozygosity for this deletion is consistent with the clinical diagnosis for HPS. Genetic counseling was recommended.\nAt our office, the patient presented with subtle signs of albinism but was otherwise unremarkable. On laboratory analysis, complete blood count showed all cell lines within normal ranges, and platelets specifically were 220,000/µL. We referred him to pulmonology as there is an association with developing pulmonary fibrosis in patients with HPS; however, those with type 3 generally have milder disease. He has not yet had preliminary pulmonary function tests or chest imaging done, but he is currently asymptomatic."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a 10-year history of an asymptomatic slowly growing solitary skin lesion on his face. The lesion sometimes oozed fluid or became ulcerated or bled. He had been using several topical and systemic steroids, antibiotics, and antifungals for years but without improvement. Past medical history, family history, and review systems were unremarkable. Skin examination revealed a solitary rounded 3 × 3 cm fleshy plaque with central crustation on the right side of his face (Fig. ). There was no lymphadenopathy. Punch skin biopsy was taken from the lesion. The epidermis showed downward papillomatous extensions. The dermis showed multiple epithelial sheets and dilated ducts that were lined by columnar cells (Fig. ). On the basis of the above clinicopathological findings, the diagnosis of SP was made. The patient was reassured and referred to a surgeon for surgical excision of the lesion."
"A 25-year-old Asian woman presented with a constant left lateral lower abdominal pain of increasing severity for 3 d, associated with nausea and vomiting for the previous 3 d at our emergency department.\nShe had left lower abdominal pain initially and then became diffuse abdominal pain with quality of cramping. She visited other hospital at first and painkillers were prescribed. However, the symptoms did not relieve.\nShe had been diagnosed with ARS and congenital glaucoma since her infancy and she underwent trabeculotomy at the age of 1-year-old.\nHer family history was unremarkable.\nUpon her admission, significant observations were telecanthus, microdontia, and an underweight build (height 149 cm, weight 39 kg, body–mass index 17.6 kg/m2). Further physical examination revealed pallor, a soft nondistended abdomen, and a nontender palpable mass in the left lower quadrant.\nLaboratory findings were all within the normal range.\nComputed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast material showed a non-homogeneously enhanced splenic parenchyma with a twisted vascular pedicle (Figure ). Moreover, the spleen was seen below the pancreatic tail in the left iliac fossa instead of its standard anatomical position."
"A 25-year-old male suffered from a fall over 100 feet in a bus from a cliff. He was managed in a local hospital with humerus plating for fracture of humerus shaft. The patient presented to us 3 months later following inability to extend his neck and new-onset weakness in left upper limb. On examination, the patient was found to have monoparesis of left upper limb along with upper motor neuron lesion signs including bilateral ankle clonus and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. Motor power in bilateral upper limbs is depicted in . Onradiological evaluation, the patient was diagnosed to have anteriorly displaced Type 2 odontoid fracture with complete dislocation of atlas over axis such that bilateral atlas inferior facets were locked anterior of axis superior facets (). Skull traction was applied in the pre-operative period with sequential weight incrementation upto 10 kgs but the facet joint reduction was not achieved. Subsequently, open reduction and posterior fixation was were planned."
"A healthy 25-year-old female presented with a pruritic eruption on the right upper extremity of 6-year duration. There was no disease in childhood. The lesions appeared to follow lines of Blaschko, with progression to the shoulder and mid-scapula during 5 months of observation ( and ()). The patient described worsening of symptoms with sun exposure. Physical examination was significant for linear, scaly, clustered plaques involving the right proximal upper extremity, shoulder, and upper back. The remainder of her examination was normal. No acantholysis was noted. The differential diagnosis included inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN), lichen striatus, linear keratosis follicularis (Darier disease), linear lichen planus, and porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PEODDN). Syndromes such as craniosynostosis–anal anomalies–porokeratosis (CDAGS) were also considered in the differential diagnosis.\nA skin biopsy revealed distinctive cornoid lamellae comprising thin, columnar, closely stacked, parakeratotic cells extending through the stratum corneum with a minimal granular layer (). A diagnosis of linear porokeratosis was established based on clinical and histologic features. A therapeutic trial of isotretinoin 1.5 mg/kg for 24 weeks (6 months) and 1.7 mg/kg for 8 weeks (2 months) resulted in dramatic regression of hyperkeratotic changes, although mild local hyperpigmentation remained at the 2-month follow-up (). The patient provided informed consent to publish her unique case findings."
"A 25-year-old male previously healthy was diagnosed as a case of AML 1 month before the presentation. High-intensity induction chemotherapy with cytarabine plus idarubicin was initiated for 10 days. The patient was referred to ophthalmology service after complaining of recent decrease in the visual acuity of the right eye for 3 days. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/100 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 11 and 10 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. Pupils were round, regular, and reactive in both eyes with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Anterior segment structures, i.e., cornea, anterior chamber, angle, iris, and lens, were within normal limits in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination (DFE) showed clear media, normal optic nerve head, and normal vessels in both eyes with foveal sub-ILM hemorrhage in the right eye and multiple small intraretinal hemorrhages in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed an elevated sub-ILM hyperreflective lesion corresponding with the foveal hemorrhage in the right eye [].\nSix months after completing the chemotherapy cycles, the patient underwent another thorough ophthalmic assessment. BCVA has improved to 20/25 in the right eye with 20/20 in the left eye. DFE showed a complete resolution of previously noted sub-ILM hemorrhage in the right eye. OCT demonstrated intact foveal contour without disruption of the ellipsoid zone or retinal architecture []."
"Under the approval of the ethics committee of Kawasaki Medical School (approval number 2723), a 25-year-old male volunteer who was able to have mSQ was recruited. The volunteer laid down on a bed in the lithotripsy position and a transrectal ultrasound probe was inserted into the rectum. The penis was manually stimulated by a female assistant. Normal spurting of semen was induced with orgasm, and after ejaculation penile stimulation continued and the penis remained erect during manual stimulation by the female assistant. The phenomenon of squirting was induced 20 s after normal ejaculation.\nAntegrade ejaculation was clearly observed and was identical to that observed in healthy males, as reported in our previous studies., Briefly, the bladder neck flattened and closed in association with contraction of the prostate before ejaculation. Immediately afterwards, rhythmical ejection of seminal fluid from the seminal vesicles through the ejaculatory duct and into the bulbous urethra was observed (Fig. ).\nThe squirting phenomenon (mSQ) was also clearly observed in Doppler image analysis. With continued stimulation of the penis for 20 s after ejaculation, translucent misty fluids came out from the extra-urethral orifice for about 60 s. Color Doppler ultrasonography recorded strong contraction of the prostate and pelvic striated muscles just before mSQ, and then the fluid stream rapidly went from the urinary bladder through the prostatic urethra (Fig. ). Subsequently, approximately 1 cm ballooning of the prostatic urethra was observed. Rhythmical contraction and slackness of the prostate and pelvic striated muscles were repeated around 20 times for 60 s (Figs ,). In other words, mSQ of gushing of fluid from the extra-urethral orifice synchronized contractions, with this series resembling pumping of urine. The bladder neck remained closed during mSQ. At the end of mSQ, the neck opened and the configuration of the prostate returned to its former state at 30 s after the end of mSQ. Therefore, the open bladder neck may be a sign of the end of mSQ. The volunteer felt orgasm during mSQ similar to normal ejaculation and urination after patience with urination. The creatinine level in the misty fluid was 55.9 mg/dL, which was similar to that of urine. The bladder was not empty. The decrease of approximately 100 mL of echographic urine volume in the bladder was observed."
"A 25-year-old married Japanese man (height 188 cm, weight 76.1 kg, body mass index 21.5) was referred to our hospital with a painless, right scrotal induration in his right testis discovered 1 month previously with no other subjective symptoms or notable histories.\nOn physical examination, the pubic hair and penis had a normal aspect (Tanner's stage was 5 each), but the atrophic testes had volumes of 8 ml on the left side and 12 mL on the right side (with an induration in the lower pole).\nTesticular cancer tumor markers were normal (human chorionic gonadotropin <0.1 mIU/mL; alpha-fetoprotein 3.1 ng/mL; lactate dehydrogenase 132 U/L); endocrinological findings indicated hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (luteinizing hormone 21.3 mIU/mL, follicle-stimulating hormone 58.0 mIU/mL, total testosterone 333 ng/dL). Two separate semen analyses revealed azoospermia.\nUltrasonography report showed a 1.9-cm internal heterogeneous echoic mass with low echoic margin in the right testis. In the Doppler mode, blood flow presence inside the tumor was ambiguous, but a signal was seen at the periphery (Fig. ).\nMalignancy was not ruled out; we planned to perform high orchiectomy. Because the patient hoped to have children, we decided to simultaneously perform a TESE from the normal testicular tissue.\nIn February 2018, the patient underwent a high orchiectomy with incision along the inguinal canal. Right spermatic cord was ligated and cut at the internal inguinal ring level. Immediately after orchiectomy, we sectioned the testis sagittally ex vivo. We observed a 1.5-cm white tumor in the lower pole of the right testis and normal testicular tissue with atrophic seminiferous tubules in the upper half (Fig. ). Approximately 200 motile and immotile spermatozoa were extracted and cryopreserved.\nPreoperative chromosomal testing results showed a 47, XXY karyotype in 20 of 20 cells.\nPathological finding of the tumor showed a cyst wall covered with keratinizing squamous epithelia (Fig. ), without malignancy evidence, diagnosed as an epidermal cyst. The remaining testicular tissue of upper half showed atrophy of most seminiferous tubules hyalinized with Leydig cell hyperplasia. Only Sertoli cells (no germ cells) were apparent in the seminiferous tubules observed. Mean Johnsen's score count was 1.1. The patient's wife is planning to undergo oocyte retrieval and intracytoplasmic sperm injection in the future. TESE in the left testis can be scheduled if required."
Patient 6 is a Hispanic woman in her 20s with no pre-existing conditions. She took famotidine 80 mg three times daily starting 9 days after first experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. She felt markedly better within 2 days of treatment but had mild dizziness and accelerated heart beats intermittently while taking famotidine.
"Patient 7 is a black and Hispanic woman in her 20s with a BMI of 41 with no pre-existing conditions. She took famotidine 80 mg three times daily for 12 days starting 6 days after first experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. Within 1 week of treatment, she reported relief of most symptoms. She reported grade 1 dizziness, insomnia and dry skin concurrent with taking famotidine."
"A 25-year-old female presented with complaints of shortness of breath, giddiness, and generalized weakness. She had a history of recurrent abortions at the gestational age of 2–3 months twice. Currently, she was 4 months gravida and was sent to us for two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography by her treating gynecologist.\nOn examination, her blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg; pulse rate was 94/min; and oxygen saturation by pulse oxymeter was 88%. There was no evidence of cyanosis or clubbing. On cardiovascular examination, apex beat was present in the left 5th intercostal space in midclavicular line, parasternal heave present, P2 palpable, and S1 loud.\nEjection systolic murmur was present in the pulmonary area. Her electrocardiography was done, which revealed incomplete RBBB but no other significant abnormality [].\nA 2D transthoracic echocardiogram was performed in the usual manner with a Vivid T8 General Electric (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) ultrasound system and a 3 MHz transducer. It showed situs solitus of the atria, AV concordance, D-loop ventricles, and ventriculoarterial concordance. There was a complete absence of interatrial septum, dilated right atrium, and right ventricle associated with morphologically normal AV valves attached at the same level at crux [ and ].\nThere was no evidence of any ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus. There was no cleft in mitral leaflets, no mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and significant pulmonary arterial hypertension measured by TR jet velocity [Figures and and Supplementary Videos –].\nOn the basis of echocardiographic findings suggestive of SA, significant pulmonary hypertension, and arterial desaturation, the patient was sent for cath study followed by further management."
"A 25-year-old woman with a history of depression and polysubstance abuse, including heavy alcohol and cocaine use, presented with 1 day of confusion and rigidity in the setting of a month-long episode of labile mood, which began after a change to her antidepressants. Her roommate found empty bottles of zolpidem, lamotrigine, oxycodone, and buspirone next to the patient. Admission vitals revealed hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, and hyperthermia to 41.1 °C. Her examination was notable for encephalopathy, flushing, clonus, and rigidity. Admitting laboratory results are detailed in . Blood cultures were negative. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed new changes, including a lack of anterior R waves and septal Q waves suggestive of cardiomyopathy. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed reduced biventricular function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, and apical hypomobility, consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy ().\nThe patient was diagnosed with severe serotonin syndrome resulting in multisystem organ failure including mixed distributive and cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, acute liver failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. She was treated with cyproheptadine (a serotonin antagonist), sedated with midazolam and hydromorphone, and paralyzed with neuromuscular blockage agents. She had labile hemodynamics with episodes of hypotension and hypertension. She was started on renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. The creatine kinase levels peaked at 22 000 U/L. She required 5 days of mechanical ventilation. A follow-up TTE 1 week after initial presentation () showed normal systolic ejection fraction without morphologic changes. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility."
The patient was a 25-year-old man and ASA class I []. Mandibular inferior alveolar nerve block (Halsted’s technique) and long buccal nerve were used for dental implant insertion in the mandibular right quadrant. Facial blanching and palatal–buccal mucosa whitening occurred.
"A 25-year-old woman was referred to our department with a 4-day history of sudden blurring vision and visual field defect in the left eye. The patient had an unremarkable previous medical history. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye. The pupils were equally round and reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect. The results of the anterior segment examination were unremarkable, and there were no vitreous cells in either eye. Fundus examination of the left eye revealed multifocal, coalescent, deep, yellow–white dots in the posterior pole and mid-periphery and foveal granularity. The fundus of the right eye was unremarkable. Near-infrared fundus autofluorescence imaging showed hypoautofluorescent spots, corresponding to the white dots seen clinically. Fluorescein angiography revealed early punctate hyperfluoresence and late staining with a “wreath-like” configuration around the fovea and optic disc staining. Structural SS-OCT showed disruption of the ellipsoid zone and subretinal accumulations of hyperreflective material over the RPE []. Structural en-face SS-OCT of the outer retina revealed hyporeflective spots corresponding to the areas of ellipsoid zone disruption. The 3 mm × 3 mm SS-OCT angiograms (DRI OCT Triton plus; Topcon) showed small areas of loss of signal at the level of the choriocapillaris. There was no evidence of signal attenuation related to the overlying inflammatory tissue to explain the reduced inner choroidal flow []. All imaging findings in the right eye were normal. Six months after the initial presentation, visual acuity in the left eye was 20/20, with normal findings on fundus examination. Structural SS-OCT showed restitution of the outer retinal layers. SS-OCTA showed a complete resolution of choriocapillaris flow voids [Figures and ]."
"A 25-year-old pregnant woman, who was a housewife in her third pregnancy and two previous deliveries, was referred to the hospital at 28 weeks and six days of gestational age with upper respiratory symptoms, fever, myalgia, and diarrhea for five days. Thereafter, the patient's clinical condition worsened to a non-productive cough and intense fatigue. She did not report comorbidities, but her husband presented with fever in the previous 24 hours and reported contact with two coworkers that had positive tests for COVID-19. She was transferred to the ICU. Corticosteroid therapy with 2 g hydrocortisone was initiated to accelerate the fetal lung maturation along with oseltamivir, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and enoxaparin in standardized doses. The patient also needed mechanical ventilation. D-dimer levels were normal (308 ng/mL), and pulmonary embolism was excluded using specific diagnostic tests. The oxygen saturation was 94% and the initial leukogram showed 4,000 WBC and 11% of lymphocytes.\nThe COVID-19 serological tests resulted negative twice, while the RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab secretions was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine was initiated (400 mg twice a day), followed by 400 mg daily for five subsequent days. A C-section was performed owing to the critical conditions of the mother, as well as severe oligohydramnios.\nA female infant weighing 1,255 g, adequate for gestational age was delivered. The Apgar score was 6 on the 1st minute and 7 on the 5th minute. The newborn tested negative for COVID-19 by RT-PCR, but was referred to the neonatal ICU because of the extreme prematurity, where she underwent a systemic antibiotic therapy owing to a right hemi thorax atelectasis. The neonate was released after 30 days in good conditions.\nThe mother remained in the ICU for 22 days, where she was treated with meropenem (500 mg three times a day) associated with vancomycin (1 g twice a day) and polymyxin-B, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The LDH result went from 226 U/L to 524 U/L during the hospitalization. . Despite the ICU stay and a continuous epinephrine drip, the patient's blood pressure decreased to 60/40 mmHg and her condition evolved to irreversible refractory shock, multiple organ failure and death. The blood cultures were all negative."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to perianal abscess and operated. His BMI was 27 klg/m and he had ASA II score due to anemia. Preoperatively, his chest examination results were normal, and a chest radiograph indicated clear lung fields. Standard monitorization of the patient was performed with electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial blood pressure measurement and pulse oximetry. According to anesthesia induction protocol, 1.5 μg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol and 1 mg/kg rocuronium bromide were used after satisfactory muscular relaxation an orotracheal intubation was performed with an 8-mm-thick cuffed tube. The patient was ventilated with a 550 ml tidal volume in order to ensure 14 respirations per minute in a volume control mode. The respiratory parameters were set in order to have a CO2 end-tidal level between 35-40 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained by providing fresh gas of 1-2% minimally alveolar consolidation (MAC) sevoflurane and 50% O2-air with 3 L/min. The surgery lasted for about 60 minutes. In the operation, 800 mL crystalloid (0.9% NaCl) infusion was made. The procedure was terminated without any complications. When enough respiratory depth was reached, severe agitation, laryngospasm and inspiratory effort developed following extubation. Negative pressure pulmonary edema was suspected due to the presence of foamy, pink colored, bloody secretion, auscultating common rales in both lungs, and oxygen-free saturation values of 86 percent. The patient was given oxygen and taken to intensive care unit for postoperative follow-up. In the first blood gas sample taken in the intensive care unit, pH was measured as 7.32, pO2: 53 mmHg, pCO2: 33 mmHg, HCO3: 18 mmol/L Lactate: 1.2 mmol/L. The patient did not need intubation and we performed NIMV with pressure mode and PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). In computed tomography of the patient, there were ground-glass opacifications and alveolar consolidations which were denser in the central interstitial area of both lungs. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation and 8 mg dexamethasone and 20 mg furosemide were given to the patient taken to intensive care unit. Following the treatments, both symptomatic and radiological improvement was seen ()."
"A male patient in his 20s was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath, cough and sputum. In the medical history of the patient, he had asthma for 3 years but he did not receive any asthma treatment. His shortness of breath deteriorated in the last month. He had no contact with any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient. Physical examination showed normal body temperature but diffuse bilateral rhonchi, and pulse oximetry revealed an oxygen saturation of 90% on ambient air. The results of his laboratory tests were as follows: white blood cell count (14.1×109/L and eosinophil count (2.89×109L); haemoglobin level was 17.4 g/L and C reactive protein (26 mg/L,). D-dimer, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and procalcitonin levels were normal. Nasopharyngeal swab was obtained from the patient for CoVID-19 RT-PCR after the chest CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacifications (). Due to the pandemic, spirometry (an aerosolising procedure) was deferred/skipped. He was hospitalized due to oxygen supplementation requirement and chest CT findings compatible with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were commenced. However, RT-PCR tests, on two occasions (at least 24 hours apart) turned out negative, and these agents were stopped after 48 hours. The patient's history of asthma and eosinophilia were remarkable but he had no skin rash and neurological, renal and cardiac symptoms. We thought the patient might have had EGPA. The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test revealed perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA)/myeloperoxidase (MPO) (1:100 titer) positive. Mucosal thickening and opacities were seen in ethmoid and maxillary sinuses on paranasal CT (). EGPA was diagnosed depending on coexistence of asthma, eosinophilia in peripheral blood, MPO-ANCA positivity and paranasal CT abnormality (Table 1). We started treatment with 50 mg/day prednisolone and inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist (LABA) combination. His asthma was under control, and shortness of breath and eosinophilia regressed under this treatment. Prednisolone dose tapered to 20 mg/day. No relapse has been observed yet at the first month control."
"A 25-year-old male complained of somnolent, behavioral, and psychiatric dysfunction for 1 month, seizures, and reduced level of consciousness for 12 days. He had presented with fever before admission. Brain MRI showed multiple T2-hyperintense lesions in bilateral frontal-parietal lobes, cingulate gyrus, and corpus callosum, some of which showed contrast enhancement (Fig. A). Lumbar puncture showed pleocytosis (18 × 106/L) and elevated protein level (22.41 mg/dL). The tests for AQP4-ab and MOG-ab were negative in his serum. Anti-NMDAR-ab (IgG isotype) titer was 1:32 in CSF and 1:100 in serum. At the same time, orofacial involuntary movements were noted. His symptoms were improved by intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg/day) and 5 days of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) regimen (0.4 g/kg/day). A second MRI performed after 20 days of treatment indicated resolved lesions of the above-mentioned cortex (Fig. B). After discharge, he started on prednisone orally and titrated to 5 mg/day.\nFour months later, he developed numbness and weakness in his right arm extremities. The numbness gradually progressed to his right arm, shoulder, chest, lower limb, and then left upper limb. Cranial MRI revealed T2-hyperintense lesions extending from the pontomedullary junction to C4 accompanied by spinal cord swelling and some contrast enhancement (Fig. C). The test for AQP4-ab was negative, but MOG-ab was positive in CSF (1:32). On day 12 after admission, the patient complained of itching from the face to the upper limbs. Five-day intravenously administered immunoglobulin was given without any improvement. His symptoms resolved 2 weeks after methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day) delivered intravenously and a tapering course of oral prednisolone. He was also treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and remained free of relapse."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to the surgery outpatient department with the chief complaint of swelling in the bilateral inguinal region for 25 days, gradually increasing in size, which had been irreducible for 1 day. It was associated with generalized abdominal pain along with nausea. However, she gave no history of abdominal distension, vomiting, or any medical or surgical interventions in the past. Clinical examination revealed irreducible bilateral inguinal swelling extending up to the labia majora, measuring approximately 5×3 cm and 6×4 cm on the right and left inguinal canal, respectively. Laboratory parameters were within normal limits, with stable vital signs. A preoperative diagnosis of bilateral irreducible inguinal hernia was made solely based upon clinical judgment, as ultrasonography (USG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilities were not available. As the laparoscopic facilities were not available during night-time, the patient was taken for open surgery. Bilateral inguinal exploration revealed a dilated canal of Nuck with encysted polycystic swelling on the right and left sides containing serous fluids along with inguinal hernia containing omentum on the left ( and ). The cystic lesion on the left side extended up to the deep ring, which suggested some gynecological lesion; however, intraoperative gynecological exploration found no pathology related to the uterus or ovary, which was confirmed by lower midline laparotomy. Excision of the dilated canal along with removal of the cystic component on the right side was carried out, while cystic component removal along with tissue repair of the indirect inguinal hernia was performed in the left inguinal area. The post-operative period remained uneventful. The patient was discharged on the sixth post-operative day. Histopathology was consistent with hydrocele of the canal of Nuck, with ischemic changes and inflammation ( and )."
"A 25-year-old male patient of Turkish origin was admitted to the University Hospital for thalassemia screening. Physical examination findings of the patient revealed no signs of anemia or other diseases. Liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels), iron, total iron-binding, B12, and folic acid levels were normal. Serology tests were negative. He was not a smoker. In the hematology panel, hemoglobin (Hb) was 17 g/dL (reference range, 13.2-16.6), red blood cell (RBC) count was 5.95 x10/ L (reference range, 3.8-5.1), white blood cell (WBC) count was 6.21 x10/L (reference range, 4.5-10.5), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 84.5 fL(reference range, 80-102), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) was 28.6 pg (reference range, 25.6-34). Hb value and RBC count are above the normal (17 g/dL and 5.95x10/L) therefore, there is some degree of erythrocytosis in this case and measured P50 value by using oxymeter was low (20 mmHg) than normal control (26.5 mmHg, reference range 26±1.3 mmHg). In thalassemia analysis examined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, an abnormal unidentified hemoglobin peak (RRT: 1.67 min., %46.9) was detected apart from the identified two basic hemoglobin peaks, which are HbA0 (RRT: 1.00 min., 42.6%) and HbA2 (RRT: 0.88 min., 2.4%), which were defined according to relative retention time (RRT) per minute. When the same sample was examined with Cation exchange HPLC method in a different system, another suspected abnormal hemoglobin peak (RT: 1.68 min., 48.3%), was detected apart from two basic hemoglobin peaks, which are HbA0 (RT: 2.57 min., 39.0%) and HbA2 (RT: 3.73 min., 2.4%) This unknown hemoglobin variant was sent to genetic analysis (DNA chain analysis) for verification. In the DNA sample obtained from the patient’s peripheral blood, HBB gene (GRChg37: NM_000518) sequence analysis (5’UTR (-110), exon 1-3, IVS1-2, 3’UTR)) was performed and heterozygous Hb Pusan variant was detected as HBB: c.439C> A (p. His147Asn). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of the case report and the accompanying images."
"A 25-year-old male, otherwise medically free, presented with pain, redness, and decreased vision in the left eye for 2 days. He was given elsewhere topical prednisolone acetate and diclofenac with no improvement. At presentation, visual acuity was counting fingers at one foot. Extraocular motility was limited in all gazes. He had severe conjunctival chemosis with a deep and quiet anterior chamber. On fundus examination, an amelanotic choroidal mass of about one disc diameter in size located inferotemporal to the disc was found. In addition, there was exudative retinal detachment (ERD) involving the macula [].\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) examination revealed multifocal ERD with increased choroidal thickening []. B-scan ultrasonography revealed subretinal fluid and hyperechogenic nodular scleral thickening with underlying diffuse edema in Tenon's space []. Extraocular muscles were normal and not involved on ultrasonography. The lesion showed medium internal reflectivity on A-scan ultrasonography []. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed early pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence along with late pooling of dye under the detached retina [-]. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) revealed diffuse hypofluorescence corresponding to the area of ERD in the early phase with multiple pinpoint hyperfluorescence in the late phases [-]. Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the orbit with contrast demonstrated scleral thickening [].\nSystemic workup including antinuclear antibodies, antidouble-stranded DNA, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor, IgG4, angiotensin-converting enzyme serum lysozyme, tuberculin skin test, syphilis serology, and CT chest was all unremarkable. The patient had a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.\nThe patient received intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g for 3 days, followed by a combination of a course of oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) along with mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice a day as a steroid-sparing agent. The patient experienced rapid improvement in vision. One month after starting treatment, visual acuity improved to 20/20, and OCT examination revealed the complete resolution of subretinal fluid []. Moreover, there was no recurrence over 6 months."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of erosion on the left nipple. The lesion was asymptomatic. One month ago, this erosion occurred with exudation and crust on the surface. Physical examination revealed that the left nipple skin was slightly raised, and a 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm nodule with infiltration. The surface of the lesion was rough and thickened with clear border, the texture was firm without tenderness (). The patient denied family history of breast cancer or exposure towards oestrogen. On the physical examination, no palpable masses were detected in the breast. Lymphadenopathy was absent. In breast ultrasound imaging studies, the nodule presented with similar tissue density with normal breast tissue, and without sign of dilated duct.\nA biopsy obtained from the left nipple revealed papillomatous hyperplasia of the epidermis, and well-circumscribed glands in the dermis. The glands were composed of monolayer columnar epithelial cells with papillomatous hyperplasia in the lumina ( and B). The luminal epithelia of the glands were positive for epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin five-sixths staining (), which confirmed the proliferation of usual ductal epithelium cells. Smooth muscle actin () and p63 demonstrated that there were myoepithelial cells surrounding the luminal epithelial cells (). In the stroma, there were diffuse sparse infiltrates composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells. The patient underwent wedge resection of the nipple, no recurrence was found after 6 months of surgery."
"Our third patient, a 25-year-old female, was admitted with the complaint of gradually progressive painless swelling in the left side of the neck for the last 2 years (Type IIc). There was no neurological deficit on examination. On examination, there was a single swelling, approximately 8 cm × 10 cm size, over the left lateral aspect of the neck, behind the posterior border of SCM. The swelling was firm and tender, mobile in anteroposterior direction but not in superoinferior direction. Intraoperatively, the tumor was seen lateral to the carotid sheath, in the posterior triangle of the neck [–]. The tumor was well encapsulated, yellowish red in color, and moderately vascular. The phrenic nerve was identified and was stretched over the capsule. The upper trunk of brachial plexus was seen in the inferomedial relation and invested in the capsule. A part of tumor capsule was left behind along the phrenic and vagus nerve, and rest of the tumor along with the capsule was excised. The patient was discharged on POD 5 and is doing well after the 7-month follow-up."
"A 25-year-old woman visited the primary gynecologic clinic because of amenorrhea for 6 months. She had frequently experienced hot flashes, night sweats, and insomnia. She experienced thelarche at age 12 years and menarche at age 14 years. Her menstruation had been irregular since menarche. A hCG urine test was negative. Basal endocrine testing revealed highly elevated serum FSH and LH levels (29.4 IU/L and 43.5 IU/L, respectively), a low E2 level (25.5 pg/mL), and normal prolactin level (14.10 ng/mL). Tests were repeated after 7 weeks and revealed serum FSH and E2 levels of 52.6 IU/L and 41.0 pg/mL, respectively, and an AMH level of 10.88 ng/mL. The patient was referred to a university hospital for further evaluation.\nThe initial physical examination at the university hospital revealed the following: height 156.8 cm, weight 66.9 kg, systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 80 mmHg, pulse rate 20/min, respiratory rate 80/min, and body temperature 36.4℃. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner classification system. A transrectal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (35 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm in the right ovary [] and 26 in the left ovary). The repeated serum FSH, LH, E2, and AMH levels acquired in the university hospital were unchanged. Elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH; 6.63 mIU/L) and normal free T4 (1.07 ng/dL) levels were observed, and all anti-thyroid antibody tests showed above normal blood levels of antibodies (anti-thyroglobulin antibody 234.6 IU/mL and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody 845.1 IU/mL). Serum androgen levels were normal. A karyotype analysis revealed a normal female karyotype. The FMR1 premutation test was normal, and the 21-hydroxylase antibody test was negative. She was prescribed conjugated estrogens (Premina®) 0.625 mg/d in combination with cyclic micronized progestogen (Utrogestan®) 200 mg daily for 14 days per month."
"A 25-year-old man presented to the hospital with mucopurulent bloody stool and epigastric persistent colic pain.\nThe patient’s symptoms started 2 wk ago. He was treated with a 2-wk course of standard anti-acid treatment as well as symptomatic therapies, such as spasmolysis and antibiotics, which were ineffective in alleviating his symptoms.\nThe patient was previously diagnosed with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.\nThe patient's vital signs were stable. Physical examination showed epigastric tenderness.\nLaboratory results showed a significant elevation of white-cell count and C-reactive protein value, which were respectively 18.8 × 109/L and 59 mg/L. Tests for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies were negative. Neither Helicobacter Pylori nor Epstein-Barr virus infection was detected.\nEndoscopy revealed mucosa with diffuse edema, ulcers, errhysis, and granular and friable changes in the stomach (Figure and ) and duodenal bulb (Figure ), which were similar to the appearance of the rectum (Figure ). Biopsy specimens from the gastroduodenum (Figure and ) and colorectum (Figure ) showed diffuse inflammation, acute cryptitis, and abscesses. Disease activity and extent were determined, and the activity of the mucosal inflammation was scored using the Mayo endoscopic subscore (Table ).\nIn order to determine whether other parts of the digestive tract were also involved, enteroscopy was suggested, but the patient refused. We identified the intactness of the small intestine through looking into the terminal ileum by colonoscopy and computed tomography (CT). Diffuse thickening of the stomach and colorectal wall was seen on CT, while the small intestine was not involved (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old male soldier presented to the emergency room with a painful and discolored small finger. He had no other relevant medical, surgical, and allergic history. The patient reported that one week prior, he had an accidental crush injury caused by a metallic door that traumatized his small finger. Immediately following the injury, the patient submerged the affected finger in icecold water for more than 5 min and reported to the local primary health care hospital and received a dressing. The patient was also prescribed antibiotics and analgesics for a period of 5 days, with the advice of follow-up after a week. The patient gradually noticed a color change over the affected finger, as well as moderate pain that would subside after analgesic use. The patient reported to the primary health care center where he was diagnosed with the cold injury of the small finger, and he was immediately referred to our hospital for further management.\nExamination of the small finger revealed a circumferential bluish dark discoloration extending from the proximal phalanx to the fingertip, with epidermolysis (), decreased range of motion (ROM), and decreased neurosensory response over the small finger. The vascularity pulse oximeter showed 70% oxygen saturation, and no fracture was elicited on X-ray ().\nBased on the clinical examination, the patient was provisionally diagnosed with a cold injury of the small finger followed by a crush injury. The patient was admitted, and he was started on an intravenous antibiotic and given daily silver sulfadiazine dressings. There was no improvement in ROM and or in the vascularity of the finger. A clear demarcation with mummification was noticed 1 cm distal to the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) of the small finger, with no improvement after one month of follow up. Under general anesthesia, with the help of tourniquet control and loop magnification, the patient was operated on for debridement of the wound.\nIntraoperatively, it was noted that the digit was necrotic, clearly demarcated, and mummified 1 cm distal to the MCPJ. In addition, the tendons and bone were found to be necrotic. A curved fish mouth incision was made 1 cm distal to the MCPJ at the level of the demarcation, and amputation of the necrotic digit was performed. Postoperatively, the wound healed uneventfully shows the affected hand 1 year after the revision amputation, further the patient offered resection of the metacarpal head for correction of the shoulder deformity but he refused and preferred to go for silicone prosthesis (Figures 3-5)."
"A 25-year-old male patient with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), who recently completed chemotherapy and who was on cefepime, meropenem and ciprofloxacin for neutropenic fever, developed non-bloody diarrhoea, fever and abdominal pain of 15 days duration.\nPhysical examination was remarkable for fever of 38–39°C, tachycardia, and lower abdominal tenderness.\nInvestigation revealed WBC count of 400 cells/mm3 with an absolute neutrophil count being 60 cells/mm3, a haemoglobin of 9 g/dl, and a platelet count of 14,000/microliter.\nStool microscopy showed many PMN cells but the patient’s renal and liver function tests were normal.\nAbdominal CT scan showed diffuse large bowel wall thickening suggesting possible infectious pan-colitis (). Subsequent sigmoidoscopy revealed diffuse mucosal erythema with pseudomembranes ().\nDetermining stool Clostridioides difficile toxin assay was not possible due to financial reasons. So, the patient was given oral vancomycin and his symptoms completely subsided."
"A 25-year-old man came to our Department presenting a progressive impairment and fullness of the left ear. Otoscopy showed a bluish, non-pulsing, retro-tympanic mass that caused a bulging ().\nPreoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed high signal intensity in T1- and T2-weighted images with a high suspicion of CG.\nTympano-mastoid canal wall up surgery was performed under general anaesthesia in order to remove the presumed CG (). Histological examination of the bioptic sample revealed the typical features of cholesterol granuloma ().\nHigh power magnification of the latter, highlighted the clefts of cholesterol crystals resulting from cholesterol dissolution during tissue processing, associated with foreign body multinucleated giant cells and haemorrhage ().\nImmunohistochemistry showed that endothelial cells presented an increased expression of angiogenetic growth factor receptors. High vascular density and increased angiogenesis were found together with high levels of VEGF and CD34 expression."
"A 25-year-old man without any comorbidities was brought to emergency department with sudden onset of dyspnea. He was hypotensive or arrival not responding to intravenous fluids and high-dose vasopressors. Arterial blood gas (ABG) showed severe metabolic acidosis with electrocardiograph (ECG) showing ST elevation in lateral leads. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography (echo) revealed global left ventricular dysfunction, ejection fraction of 25% along with elevation of cardiac biomarkers. His condition rapidly deteriorated with refractory hypotension and severe lactic acidosis. Initiated on venoarterial (VA) ECMO as a rescue therapy with left femoral venous access (25 Fr) and right femoral arterial access (17 Fr) with an extra 6 Fr sheath inserted distally into right femoral artery for the perfusion of distal leg cannula. Pump flow was maintained at 4.5 L/minute. Heparin-bonded circuit was used and anticoagulation was avoided due to coagulopathy. He progressed to acute kidney injury with worsening of lactic acidosis and developed wide QRS complexes () and he was treated with magnesium and trimetazidine. He also developed severe ischemic hepatitis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and was managed with blood product transfusion. The serum transaminases peaked at day 3 and showed a decreasing trend by day 5. His pancreatic enzymes were also elevated and a diagnostic ultrasound confirmed pancreatitis which was managed conservatively. Dobutamine was initiated as the vasopressors gradually tapered with good clearance of lactate and good peripheral perfusion. Serial 2D echo showed improvement in left ventricle (LV) function. He was continued on dialysis because of oliguria and recurrent pulmonary edema. Patient was weaned off VA ECMO successfully on day 6 and extubated onto high-flow nasal cannula on day 7. His liver and renal functions gradually recovered and coagulopathy reversed and he was discharged home on day 12 ( and )."
"A 25-year-old male presented with backache and a progressive left lower extremity proximal paresis (iliopsoas/quadriceps 4/5) and a distal severe foot drop (extensor hallucis longus/ dorsiflexor 0/5) of 5 months duration. As his bladder was not completely emptying, he required a Foley catheter. The enhanced MRI of the lumbar spine showed a T12-L1 intramedullary lesion involving the conus medullaris/proximal filum terminale [].\nFollowing a D12-L1 laminectomy, gross total excision of an intramedullary lesion was achieved, including total removal of tumor capsule. Postoperatively, the improved within 1 month (e.g., left iliopsoas/quadriceps 5/5 and the left-sided foot drop (2/5), and the urinary dysfunction resolved. Histopathologically, the tumor was found to be a mature teratoma [ and ]."
"A 25-year-old otherwise healthy woman presented to the OPD with complaints of persistent headache and defective vision of 6 months duration. She was investigated and identified with an intracranial space occupying lesion in the right lateral ventricle. She was scheduled for right parieto-occipital craniotomy and resection the mass. Tumor was accessed through an interhemispheric transcallosal approach and debulked. Preoperatively, there was a significant tumor bleed, and resultant brain swelling due to intraventricular hemorrhage. She recovered with symptomatic ventriculomegaly, subsequently a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed by using the Chhabra “Slit n Spring” hydrocephalus shunt system. Histopathology with immunohistochemical correlation confirmed central neurocytoma with an MIB-1 labeling index 4%. Residual tumor confirmed on a postoperative imaging and she was subjected to 3D conformal radiotherapy to a total dose of 54 Gy in 30 fractions on a daily dose of 180 cGy over 6 weeks. She was given oral temozolomide for all 6 weeks (75 mg/m2), followed by six cycles of temozolomide at 28 day intervals. Each cycle was for 5 days (150 mg/m2 in 1st cycle, subsequent cycles, 175 mg/m2). She tolerated therapy well and are on regular follow-up. No recurrence observed in the MRI scan after 3 years post therapy [ and ]."
"A 25-year-old female initially presented to another institute with the complaints of neck pain and paresthesia in all four limbs. Investigations revealed Chiari malformation with syringomyelia []. The patient was operated, and a foramen magnum decompression with a C1 and C2 laminectomy was performed. In addition, a syringo-subarachnoid shunt was performed at D3 level. The patient did not improve in her symptoms following surgery and after a period of 1 month started deteriorating neurologically. She started having increased paresthesia and weakness in all her limbs. When she presented to us 1 year following the initial surgery, she had spastic quadriparesis with a power of grade 3–4/5 (Goel Clinical Grade 4, JOA 8). Sensations were decreased in both her lower limbs. She was unable to walk unaided, and she could not perform her routine activities independently. Investigations performed at this time showed persistent Chiari formation and syringomyelia. The patient was operated and atlantoaxial fixation was done []. The patient improved in her symptoms following surgery. At a follow-up of 3 years, the patient is relieved of all her complaints and is back to her routine life. Postoperative imaging showed atlantoaxial fixation and reduction in the size of the syrinx []."
"A 25 years old lady (obese built) presented with esodeviation of her right eye for the past 1 month (December 2015). She had a faint horizontal doubling of images. In the past, she had refractive surgery procedure done in her right eye, elsewhere, 6 years back (no previous documents were available). There was no history of any specific antecedent medical illness or medication use. On examination, she had a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/60 in the right eye (−8 D/−1 D cyl/10°) and 6/6p in the left eye (Plano). The pupils were normally reacting to light and near stimuli and did not show any afferent defect. The color vision was normal (21/21) in the left eye, while in the right eye, the response was unreliable. Both eyes anterior segment exam (including intraocular pressure [IOP]-14 mmHg OD, 15 mmHg OS) were within normal limits. The orthoptic review revealed an esodeviation (25 PD for distance and near) with right eye minimal abduction deficit (−1 grade) [Fig. -]. On the fundus exam, the media were clear in both eyes. The right eye optic disc was hyperemic with trace disc edema (Frisen grading grade 0), while the left eye optic disc showed florid disc edema (Frisen grade 4), with peripapillary edema just stopping short of fovea [Fig. and ], as described elsewhere.[] The visual field assessment revealed no gross visual field defect in the right eye (confrontation field), while an enlarged blind spot was documented in the automated visual field of the left eye [].\nIn a case of disc edema, the differential diagnosis and management varies, depending on whether the edema is unilateral or bilateral.[] The marked asymmetry in disc edema in our case was perplexing. On a detailed exam, we noted the marked asymmetry in axial length (32.01 mm OD vs 23.18 mm OS). We proceeded on lines of papilledema management (considering the finding as asymmetric disc edema). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain ruled out any compressive pathology and subsequent, magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) ruled out any void in cortical venous sinuses. The patient was referred to the neurologist for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tap, which revealed an elevated opening pressure (280 mm of H2O) and normal CSF analysis. A diagnosis of IIH was confirmed. The patient responded well to carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy (Tab acetazolamide 500 mg twice a day). The optic disc edema and esodeviation of the right eye resolved in about a month's time. [Fig. -] The resolved disc edema was maintained in both eyes at last follow-up (May 2019)."
"We present a case of a 25-year-old male patient, shepherd by occupation, native of Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh. He presented to our clinic with complaints of difficulty in walking and convulsions for the past 20 years. For all these years, he was being treated by a local physician and was misdiagnosed as a case of poliomyelitis. Neurological examination had revealed muscle wasting and contracture of both limbs on the right side. Power was grade four. Speech and vision were normal. No other deficit was found. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed a well-defined spherical nonenhancing, hypodense, well-circumscribed, peripherally calcified 7 cm × 8 cm size space occupying lesion in the left frontoparietal region []. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonenhancing intra-axial focal lesion with calcified walls [Figure and ]. No restriction on diffusion was observed. Cyst wall appeared hypo-intense in all sequences with blooming area, suggestive of calcification. No perilesional edema was seen. Complete work-up of the patient was done but there was no presence of primary disease in other organs. The patient was operated with frontoparieto-temporal craniotomy. The mass was totally calcified and loosely adherent to dura matter. Through simple dissection, mass was excised in one piece without rupture and spillage. The weight of the cyst was around 300 g []. The longest and shortest diameter of the cyst were 25.4 cm and 23.9 cm, respectively [Figure and ]. The cavity was then irrigated with hypertonic saline jet. Ventricle was incidentally punctured leading to spilling of cerebrospinal fluid. Dura was closed primarily. There was no postoperative new neurological deficit. Histopathological examination revealed calcified hydatid cyst. The patient was discharged on 10th postoperative day after removal of the sutures and was prescribed tablet albendazole 400 mg BD for a month and advised regular follow-up."
"With complain of impotence, a 25-year-old male was admitted in our hospital. Physical and neurologic examinations of the patient have shown no signs of neurologic deficit. An L-spine magnetic resonance image (MRI) was conducted to find a spinal lesion, which has revealed a SEAC located from T11 to L3 level. In addition, thecal sac compression was also discovered ().\nInitially, a cystography was conducted to determine the real-time cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak point; however, the real-time leak point has not been clearly detected through the examination (). Because the post-cystography computed tomography (CT) showed that the contrast had spread into the subarachnoid space, we attempted to find the dural defect () using myelography and myelo-CT by studying the CSF flow. However, these examinations did not show any signs of the real-time leak site, although they demonstrated that the contrast had spread into the cyst ( & ). Prior to surgery, it is essential to locate the dural defect site in order for the operation to be minimized. Thus, the location of the dural defect has been estimated based on the earliest contrast-filling region in myelography, as well as the mid-level and widest area of the cyst found on the MRI (, ). Consequently, a partial laminectomy was performed at the level of T12. After removal of the ligament flavum, the dural defect was then be able to be detected, and it was discovered that the nerve root and arachnoid membrane were partially herniated through the defect (). Thus, we pushed the root and arachnoid membrane back inside the defect and closed the defect by suture and patch with TachoComb® (CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) (). Follow-up MRI was performed two months after surgery, which has shown the SEAC was finally disappeared (). Furthermore, the patient's symptoms have recently improved."
"A 25-year-old man from Southern California presented virtually by telephone appointment with a 4-day history of headaches, myalgia, chills and fevers up to 39.2°C in July of 2020. On the day of this initial evaluation, he was tested for SARS-CoV-2—the virus causing COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal PCR testing and found to be negative.\nOne day later, on day 5 of his illness, he presented to the emergency department for persistent symptoms of fever, body aches and headache. He also had vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, congestion, chills and fatigue. He denied any sick contacts, rash, chest pain or shortness of breath. In the emergency department, he was febrile with a temperature of 38.4°C. Comprehensive physical examination was normal. A second PCR test for SARS-CoV2 was negative. He was treated with 600 mg oral Ibuprofen. Given the stability of his vital signs and clinical examination, he was discharged with a diagnosis of presumptive viral syndrome. He was advised to follow up for any worsening symptoms.\nOn day 8 of his illness, he reported persistent fevers, cough, body aches and vomiting during telephonic follow-up. He reported new back pain and a maximum temperature of 39.9°C. He denied dysuria, rash or shortness of breath. Given his persistent symptoms and repeatedly testing negative for COVID-19, he was advised to pursue further evaluation and work up in urgent care.\nAt time of arrival in urgent care, he was tachycardic with a pulse rate of 125 and febrile with a temperature of 38.1°C. Physical examination was normal. Serological examination indicated bandaemia of 20.3% and lymphocytopaenia recorded at 0.78×1000/µL. Blood culture was obtained and ultimately showed no growth at 5 days. He was treated with 1 g of intramuscular ceftriaxone, 1000 mg of acetaminophen, 1000 mL of intravenous sodium chloride. He was subsequently discharged with azithromycin for 5 days and precautions to return to the emergency department if he experienced worsening symptoms.\nOn day 14 of his illness, during another virtual telephone encounter, he endorsed daily and persistent fevers up to 37.9°C. He also reported cough, chills, body aches, headache, dizziness, fatigue and diarrhoea. He was speaking in full sentences on the phone with no audible wheezing and did not appear to be in any distress. On inquiry of his occupation, he reported he was a dog trainer."
"A 25-year-old man presented to our hospital with a mass on the left thigh, which he had for 2 years. Clinical assessments at the first visit revealed a firm, fixed, well-circumscribed, pinkish polypoid tumor measuring about 3×3×1.5 cm (). He was in the habit of picking pieces of the small mass from time to time. There was no specific family history or past medical history related to solitary sclerotic fibroma and physical examination showed neither pain nor tenderness. Under general anesthesia, the authors performed a surgical excision and the defect was covered with a split thickness skin graft without radiation therapy ().\nHistopathologically, the lesion showed a well-defined, hypocellular intradermal fibrotic nodule (). It was negative for CD 34, smooth muscle actin, β-catenin and showed abundant, dense hyalinized collagen bundles (). The most central area had a storiform arrangement intermixed with paucicellular dense collagen bundle that were separated by prominent clefts and it was consistent with sclerotic fibroma ()."
"A 25-year-old female underwent a posterior-only L5 vertebrectomy accompanied by a pedicle screw instrumented fusion from L3-S1 []. Once the L5 vertebral body was resected under fluoroscopic guidance, a reasonably sized expandable cage was placed into the anterior intervertebral space; this extended from the inferior endplate of L5, to the superior endplate of S1. Contoured cobalt-chromium rods were then applied from L3 to the ilium [ and ] []."
"Mr. VKR, 25-year-old male consulted psychiatry OPD with complaints of cannabis intake for 3 years, elevated mood, physical restlessness, increased talkativeness, tall claims, overfamiliarity, and decreased need of sleep for 2 months. The patient was diagnosed as per the ICD-10-DCR with mental and behavioral disorders due to the use of cannabinoids, psychotic disorder predominantly manic symptoms. The patient was admitted and he was started on carbamazepine 600 mg, haloperidol 10 mg and trihexyphenidyl 2 mg, with which his symptom improved and on the above medication, patient was discharged. Subsequently, after 2 months’ follow-up, he presented with symptoms of low mood, lethargy, decreased interest in work, reduced self-esteem, and reduced attention and concentration. The patient was started on escitalopram 5 mg and his dose of haloperidol was reduced to 7.5 mg and he continued carbamazepine and trihexyphenidyl as mentioned above. Within 2 days of starting of escitalopram, the patient became restless and could not remain seated or standing and kept on walking or pacing. He was thrashing his hands all around and hitting his hands on the wall and several occasions, sustained injury. He was constantly swinging his legs, rocking from foot to foot while standing and was crossing and uncrossing the legs when sitting. The patient had severe distress due to these symptoms and was not able to sleep. He ran out of home and jumped into a pond near his house, but he was saved. He was kept tied with a rope by his family members as he was running around and was constantly expressing suicidal ideas. The next day patient was brought to psychiatry OPD. During the interview, he confessed that he had severe restlessness, which was intolerable, so he jumped into the pond to commit suicide. His score on the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) scale was 9 (severe akathisia).[] As per the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Scale, the probability of association of this adverse reaction with escitalopram was 7 (i.e., probable).[] Results of routine blood investigation and computed tomography scan of the brain revealed no abnormality. He had no remarkable neurological findings. After other possible disorders were excluded, the diagnosis of severe akathisia, possibly induced by escitalopram, was made. Subsequently, escitalopram was stopped, and other medications were continued. His symptoms continued despite prompt discontinuation of the drug. Akathisia was treated with propranolol 20 mg once daily and clonazepam 0.5 mg thrice daily and was tapered over 10 days. Akathisia quickly resolved and didnot reappear later."
"An infant girl was born to a 25-year-old woman at 39 weeks gestation. The baby weighed 2.5 kg and had an Apgar score of 9/10. The baby was noted to have jaundice on day one with a serum bilirubin level of 290 mmol/L. There was a drop in hemoglobin within one day from 20.3 g/dL to 17.0 g/dL with a high reticulocyte count (9.3%) recorded. There was no other cause to suggest neonatal jaundice, such as intrauterine infections and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. An urgent peripheral blood film was sent and showed hemolysis with numerous spherocytes and the presence of nucleated RBCs and polychromasia. The baby’s blood group was B rhesus (RhD) positive. Direct Coombs test was positive with IgG specificity. Red cell elution studies of infant blood identified the presence of anti-E and anti-Jka antibodies. Her red cells phenotyping showed DCEce (R1R2) Jka+Jkb-, which was similar to the father.\nAntenatally, the mother had a threatened miscarriage at 13 weeks. She was discharged well without any complications or requiring any blood transfusion. Her blood group was B Rh-positive, and her antibody screening at that time was negative. The pregnancy progressed well without any complications. Post-delivery, her hemoglobin level was 12.0 g/dL with positive antibody screening. In the postnatal period, antibody identification was done and alloantibodies to Jka and E antigen were found. The mother’s RBC phenotyping was Jka-Jkb+ and E-e+. Maternal anti-E and the anti-Jka antibody titer were determined as 1:512 and 1:32, respectively.\nIntravenous immunoglobulin and intensive phototherapy were started for the baby since bilirubin levels were increasing. Simultaneously, we requested fresh whole blood with both antigens negative (E and Jka) in anticipation for a possible need for an exchange transfusion from the blood bank. The possibilities for anti E or anti-Jka to cause severe jaundice is rare, but based on one case report, the chances to develop severe HDFN cannot be ignored. HDFN due to anti-Jka is rare and can cause persistent anemia in the infant. Fortunately, the baby’s two-hourly serum bilirubin level showed a decreasing trend, and she did not require exchange transfusion and was discharged well on day nine. The daily blood investigations are shown in ."
"A 25-year-old female presented with dysuria and lower abdominal pain, especially during menstruation. She had a previous cesarean section. The physical examination was within normal limits. The sonography showed a 55 mm × 40 mm mass lesion in the bladder. Contrast computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed an ill-defined heterogeneously enhancing solid-cystic lesion, with predominantly cystic component, over the antero-superior part of the urinary bladder, extending anteriorly in the prevesical space and infiltrating into the anterior abdominal wall muscles, in the region of the previous cesarean section scar. The lesion measured 50 mm × 29 mm × 26 mm []. The lesion was not extending towards the umbilicus and the rest of the bladder was normal. Cystoscopy showed a mass over the dome of the bladder. The mucosa over the mass lesion was normal. As the mass was mimicking malignancy, decision was taken to excise it and send for histopathological examination. A lower abdominal exploration was performed with a Pfannenstiel incision including the cesarean scar. There was a mass lesion in the abdominal muscles on the right lateral side of the midline extending till the bladder dome. Complete excision of the mass with partial cystectomy was performed []. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of plasma cells, giant cells with calcium deposits, foamy histiocytes, and presence of Michaelis–Gutmann bodies, which is pathognomonic of malacoplakia. Periodic acid–Schiff staining was performed to confirm the finding of Michaelis–Gutmann bodies []. Further confirmation was obtained by the Von Kossa staining which showed the presence of calcium in the Michaelis–Gutmann bodies []. All the above findings were suggestive of malacoplakia. In addition, histopathology also showed features of mullerianosis. It consisted of endometrial glands and surrounding endometrial stroma and also the glands that were lined by columnar epithelium []. The presence of these two histological features confirmed the diagnosis of mullerianosis.\nThe patient had uneventful postoperative course. Her symptoms of dysuria during menses completely subsided after the surgery."
"Case 1: A 25-year-old woman [body mass index (BMI): 27 kg/m2, A Rh (+), graft volume: 600 cc, remnant liver: 29%] was admitted to our liver transplant institute to donate a part of her liver to her 33-year-old sister with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis. Radiological and biochemical examinations were completed using the preoperative donor evaluation algorithm available in our liver transplant institute. The donor candidate underwent laparotomy using a modified Makuuchi incision (reversed L-shaped incision). The exploration showed ectopic liver tissue approximately 15 mm × 5 mm in size, located in the gallbladder corpus, and had no association with the liver (Figure ). Cholecystectomy was performed to include the ectopic liver tissue, and cholangiography was carried out via the cystic duct, and the biliary tract anatomy was found to be normal (Choi Type I). Right lobe donor hepatectomy was performed as previously described in our transplant institute. The donor was discharged without any postoperative complications. Macroscopically, the gallbladder specimen was 70 mm in length, 50 mm in diameter, and 3 mm in wall thickness. Histopathologically, the tissue (15 mm × 3 mm × 2 mm) located in the gallbladder corpus was ectopic liver tissue (Figure and )."
"A 25-year-old gentleman presented with complaints of blurred vision in the right eye (RE) after a history of blunt trauma with a cricket ball seven days prior. He had been started on anti-glaucoma drops and topical steroids by a local physician. His corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/800 in the RE and 20/20 in the left eye (LE). The intraocular pressure on applanation tonometry was 17 and 16 mm Hg in the RE and LE, respectively. On ocular examination, a resolving hyphema and anterior chamber reaction were noted in the RE. Funduscopy revealed a subretinal bleed at the posterior pole and inferiorly with a resolving vitreous hemorrhage []. There was no evidence of a rhegma or dialysis after a dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral indentation. The optical coherence scan (OCT) of the RE macula showed extensive subretinal scarring with gross disruption of the photoreceptor layer and decreased retinal thickness []. The LE examination was within normal limits.\nThe patient was explained about the guarded vision prognosis and asked to review in a fortnight. On follow-up at three weeks, fundus examination revealed a thick epiretinal membrane, glial condensation with a taut posterior hyaloid face and a macular TRD []. An OCT scan revealed a thick preretinal membrane bridging the disc and macula with a pucker like concave configuration [, below]. A thorough fundus examination again did not reveal any breaks or dialysis.\nIn view of the above development, a vitrectomy with membrane peeling and silicone oil infusion (for a longer tamponade) was done for the RE, following which the vision improved to 20/120 one-month post-surgery. There were poor outer retinal integrity and RPE clumping and scarring evident on both clinically and on the OCT scan []. An intraoperative peripheral retinal evaluation also did not reveal any predisposing breaks or dialysis.\nSilicone oil removal was done 6 months later, following which the vision remained stable at 20/120 and the clinical findings remained status quo []."
"A 25-year-old male presented with painless loss of vision in right eye (RE) since 2 months. The left eye (LE) had low vision since 3 years. There was no family history of ocular disorders. Visual acuity was perception of light in both eyes (BE), while projection of rays was inaccurate in LE. He had gross malar and mandibular hypoplasia with multiple preauricular skin tags on the left face, along with a dysmorphic right external ear. BE visual axis was involved by limbal dermoids and complicated cataract with low IOP. Ultrasound showed retinal detachment (RD) in BE, with LE having a funnel configuration []. No choroidal coloboma or staphyloma was detected. Axial length was measured as 19.13 mm in RE, and 17.47 mm in LE. Further systemic work up revealed kypho-scoliosis without any visceral defects. Hence the patient was diagnosed to have Goldenhar syndrome (GS) with BE RD.\nThe patient underwent RE dermoid excision, pars plana vitrectomy, pars plana lensectomy and silicone oil injection. During surgery, an old total rhegmatogenous RD (RRD) with severe inferior retinal shortening was noted along with lattice degeneration and retinal hole []. The vitreous cavity appeared grossly empty, even after staining with triamcinolone. Three months after surgery, the visual acuity was 20/400-N36 with attached retina and normal IOP []."
"A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of recurrent acute pancreatitis (AP) for 2 years. Her body mass index (BMI) was 16.5 kg/m2. She had no family history of pancreatic disease and did not drink regularly or smoke. Her fasting blood glucose was 5.1 mmol/L and HbAlc was 5.3%. Symptoms such as steatorrhea or diarrhea did not occur. Upper abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a ductal stricture in the pancreatic head with upstream dilation, and a filling defect (the radiolucent stone) of the pancreatic duct was displayed in the MRI. Radiolucent stones were observed in the pancreatic duct, confirming the diagnosis of CP. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed (). After sphincterotomy, radiolucent stones were extracted and an 8.5F, 5-cm plastic stent was placed (). The patient was discharged, but had AP 2 weeks later, and a second ERCP was performed. The plastic stent was found to be occluded by protein-like stones. Balloon sphincteroplasty was performed and the stricture was dilated to 1.0 cm. Three 10F, 7-cm plastic stents were placed to achieve better drainage (). Two months after the second ERCP, she again had AP. CT showed three well-placed plastic stents and a greatly dilated pancreatic duct. A third ERCP was performed. Three plastic stents were found to be occluded by protein-like radiolucent stones () and the main pancreatic duct (MPD) was full of protein-like stones. The pancreatic duct was cleaned using a stone extraction balloon, and a nasopancreatic tube was inserted. The nasopancreatic tube was flushed four times a day with normal saline, but protein-like stones formed continuously and rapidly. After 2 weeks of flushing, the pancreatic juice still contained copious protein-like stones ().\nAfter multidisciplinary consultation, the following conservative treatment strategy was proposed: (1) no more endotherapy; (2) no dietary restriction and a diet with 40% to 50% of calories from fat was recommended; (3) no pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy; and (4) regular exercise (more than three times a week, more than 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each time, and 6000 to 10,000 steps of physical activity per day).\nThese suggestions aimed to increase the secretion of pancreatic fluid to achieve auto-flushing of the pancreatic duct so that the protein-like stones would not occlude the pancreatic duct. No AP or CP-related symptoms occurred during the 5-year follow-up. The patient’s BMI increased to 19 kg/m2, and she achieved complete pain relief after she implemented the above recommendations."
"A 25-year-old Fulani man referred to our center with arrow injury in to the nose of 6 hours duration following fight over farmland. There was bleeding from the nose and the mouth, associated with odynophagia, no difficulty in breathing. Clinical examination revealed a young man conscious, not in respiratory distress with arrow impacted in the left side of the nose []. X-ray paranasal sinuses showed the arrow passed through the left side of the nose into maxillary antrum, the arrow went posterior-medially into the nasopharynx []. Arrow was removed under general anesthesia with orotracheal intubation. Arrow was approached through lateral rhinotomy incision along the entry point, dissection continued until the fangs of the arrow were exposed. The fangs were then clipped together, and the arrow was removed gently, and antral irrigation was done to drain blood that collected in the left maxillary antrum. The patient was stable postoperatively and was discharge, no complication was recorded."
"Patient 7 is a 25-year-old woman with an 8-year history of bilateral CRPS-II after lower extremity cyst excision. She presented with allodynia, edema, erythema, and warmth along the medial, dorsal, and lateral right foot extending midway up her right lower extremity. She was diagnosed with CRPS, which spread to the left lower extremity within 6 months. In addition to physical therapy, she trialed anticonvulsants (pregabalin 300 mg daily; gabapentin 3600 mg daily in divided doses; levetiracetam 1000 mg daily in divided doses; and lamotrigine 100 mg daily), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine 120 mg daily), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine 150 mg daily and nortriptyline 125 mg daily), steroids, low-dose naltrexone (9 mg nightly), ketamine (5-day infusion of 40 mg/hour; intranasal spray up to 45 mg), adrenergic agonists (clonidine transdermal patch 0.2 mg per day; oral 0.1 mg daily), and opioids. Most were discontinued because of poor efficacy or side effects. She pursued unconventional approaches including pentoxifylline, tadalafil, and beta blockers without benefit. She was prescribed HCQ (400 mg b.i.d. for 8 weeks, then 200 mg daily) during a prolonged pain flare (4 years after CRPS onset). Decreases in swelling and trophic changes were documented within 2 months of HCQ initiation (Fig. ); however, after 8 months, she questioned lasting benefit and discontinued HCQ. Swelling and trophic changes returned to their pre-HCQ severity. She restarted HCQ (200 mg b.i.d. for 8 weeks followed by 200 mg daily) with subsequent documented improvements in pain, swelling, and trophic changes. She reports continued analgesia with HCQ and near-complete resolution of skin changes, and is enrolled in the medical school."
"A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath (SOB). The patient’s medical history was unremarkable; however, the patient had a 4-day history of progressive fatigue and fever. In the ED, the patient’s blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 140 beats per minute, oxygen saturation was 98% in room air, and temperature was 37.1°C. A physical examination revealed tachycardia and coarse crackles in the both lower lung zones. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with ST segment elevation and PR depression in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 and ST depression and PR elevation in aVR (). The initial laboratory work-up revealed leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and elevated troponin (21.471 ng/mL; normal range, 0–60 ng/mL). An echocardiogram demonstrated diffuse left ventricular hypokinesia with an ejection fraction of 35% and a pulmonary artery pressure of 30 mmHg. Consolidation and ground-glass opacities suggesting viral infection were detected in the right lower lobe on chest computed tomography (). The patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit with the suspicion of COVID-19-related myopericarditis. Although the initial polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, considering the high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, the patient was kept under isolation and empirical antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive therapy were initiated, including ampicillin-sulbactam (1.5 g four times a day), clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), oseltamivir (75 mg twice a day), acetylsalicylic acid (81 mg once a day), and metoprolol (50 mg twice a day). An emergency coronary angiography was not performed as the patient’s clinical condition was attributed to the viral infection. The patient’s sputum, blood, and urine cultures were negative. The patient was treated in the cardiac care unit for 8 days, during which his laboratory and radiological findings normalized (). An echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% prior to discharge. Antibody testing for COVID-19 was positive on the 8th day of hospitalization. The patient provided written informed consent for this report."
"A female patient, aged 25 years old, sought orthodontic treatment with the chief complaint of dental and facial asymmetry (Figures and ).\nShe had no systemic diseases.\nShe had an aesthetic injection in her right chin and no other significant medical histories and denied a genetic history.\nShe had no family history.\nPretreatment frontal face evaluation showed an asymmetrical face with the right side larger than the left, the chin shifted to the left, and pronounced inclination of the occlusal plane. The two pupils were also not on the same horizontal line (Figure ). The intraoral examination showed a more than full-cusp class III molar relationship and crossbites in the left posterior region (Figure ). The maxillary right second molar was congenitally missing, and the right second mandibular molar had a serious defect in the dental hard tissues. The maxillary midline was diverted to the right by 4 mm, the mandibular midline was shifted to the left by 6 mm, and there was a marked inclination of the maxillary occlusal plane.\nThe analysis of study casts showed an overjet of -0.15 to 2.48 mm and crowding in the maxillary and mandibular anterior (Table , Figure ). The anterior Bolton index was 83%, and the overall Bolton index was 96% (17 was absent, Table ).\nThe panoramic radiograph indicated the absence of tooth 17 and mild alveolar absorption in the whole dentition (Figure ). The lateral cephalometric analysis indicated a skeletal class III relationship (ANB, 1.9°; Wits appraisal, -5.7°) (Figure , Table ). Ricketts’ frontal cephalometric analysis (Table ) showed skeletal asymmetry of the mandible and mandibular dental asymmetry (Figure ). The functional examination showed no signs of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder, but the mandible deflected to the left when the jaw was opened (Figure ). The cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) image analysis of facial asymmetry (Figure ) showed that both the frontal and lateral ramal inclinations and the mandibular body length were larger on the right side than on the left side, which contributed to the mandibular deviation toward the left (Figure ). Not only was mandible asymmetry present, but the bilateral orbital, zygomatic and maxilla were also asymmetrically developed. There were no obvious symptoms in her ear."
"A 25-year-old female at 30 weeks of gestation presented with a history of intermittent hematochezia for 2 months. She also had dyspnea on exertion and palpitations. She had a history of six units of blood transfusion in the last 2 weeks. Physical examination revealed severe pallor. Her hemoglobin was 7.9 gm/dL. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal. Colonoscopy with terminal ileoscopy showed normal terminal ileum but altered blood in the ascending and transverse colon. Ultrasound abdomen was unremarkable except for gravid uterus. The patient continued to have hematochezia with further requirements of 2 units of blood transfusion while in hospital, and thus, a CT scan was advised. The CT scan with angiography revealed a small area of tortuous vessel with arterial enhancement along the mesenteric border of the ascending colon, which showed progressive enhancement with arterial supply from ileocolic branch of the superior mesenteric artery and the early draining vein into superior mesenteric vein (Fig. ). These findings were suggestive of colonic angiodysplasia or arteriovenous malformation. She underwent right hemicolectomy, after which her bleeding stopped. Gross examination of the resected specimen showed a 2 × 1.5-cm area of mucosal discoloration with prominent tortuous blood vessels (Fig. a, Supporting information). Histopathological examination showed multiple dilated and tortuous blood vessels spurting in the mucosa and a few in the submucosa and also showed lamina propria showing mixed inflammatory infiltrate with submucosal edema and hemorrhage (Fig. b). These findings were consistent with angiodysplasia. She delivered a healthy baby 6 weeks later.\nAlthough colonic angiodysplasia is a well-recognized cause of hematochezia in the general population with risk factors that include older age, chronic kidney diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, this is the first-ever report of such a lesion in a pregnant woman. Management options include pharmacotherapy, endoscopic intervention, angioembolization, and surgery. An abdominal CT scan, although contraindicated in pregnancy, proved to be a boon for this patient, diagnosing the cause of her gastrointestinal bleed and guiding the definitive therapy."
"A 25-year-old man presented to our emergency department with history of pain, swelling and loss of tumescence with a cracking sound during masturbation. No history of difficulty while passing urine.\nPhysical examination revealed swollen penis. Left side of the shaft was tender to touch. Glans penis was not visible due to swelling of prepuce. Penis was in a flaccid state and deviated to right side. Foleys catheter was placed without any difficulty and clear urine drained. No evidence of peri-catheter bleeding. In view of above-mentioned findings, diagnosis of fracture penis was made which was later confirmed by USG penis. USG showed a 1.0-cm defect in left corpora cavernosum in mid shaft with heterogenous hematoma formation in the penile shaft, adjacent to the breech.\nPatient was taken up for emergency hematoma evacuation and fracture repair. Circumferential sub-coronal incision given and penis degloved. Hematoma evacuated and a transverse tear, approximately 1.0 cm on tunica albuginea of left sided corpus cavernosum identified []. Closure of tunical defect was done with interrupted 3.0 vicryl suture. Hemostasis secured and skin closed using 3.0 rapid vicryl. Post-operative period was uneventful. Foleys catheter was removed on 3rd post-operative day. Patient was discharged on 4th post-operative day, in satisfactory condition with the advice to come for urology and psychiatric consultation, as an outpatient, after 1 week and to avoid sexual activity for 6 weeks. On routine follow up till 9 months, patient was voiding well with no erectile dysfunction, no pain or chordee on erection []."
"A 25-year-old female patient who had sudden painless blurred vision in her right eye 3 months ago admitted to the clinic. Her visual acuity was 20/20 (LogMAR 0.00) in both eyes. Intraocular pressures were 16 and 14 mm Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively. Pupils were round and reactive in both eyes without evidence of the relative afferent pupillary defect in either eye. Biomicroscopy of the anterior segments were unremarkable. Dilated fundus exams revealed mildly attenuation and tortuosity of retinal arteries in both eyes. Three months ago, in the right eye fundus photo; intensive, extensive pallor and retinal edema in the lower quadrant of the retina due to inferotemporal BRAO was seen []. No embolic plaques were noted. The red-free photograph of the right eye greatly accentuates the retinal whitening and attenuation of the inferotemporal retinal artery []. Optical coherence tomography of the right eye showed normal foveal contour with inner retinal ischemia and thickening, with shadowing of the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial layer consistent with an acute inferotemporal BRAO []. Fundus examination and images taken in our clinic at the 3rd month confirmed the recovery of retinal edema in the right eye []. Attenuation of the inferotemporal retinal artery still mildly appeared []. Applied confrontation fields (standard automated perimetry, program test 30-2) showed a visual field defect corresponding with the affected area in the right eye and normal visual field in the left eye. Informed consent was taken from the patient to report this case.\nThere was no history of smoking, migraine, systemic, infectious disease, malignancy, trauma, medication, or surgery. Cardiological and neurological evaluations were reported as normal in another center. The results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbita, electrocardiogram and echocardiography, Doppler ultrasound imaging of the carotid arteries were normal. Evaluation for potential stroke factors revealed no suggestive family history.\nNo ocular therapy was offered. The patient was advised to go to hematology. Blood investigations including complete blood count with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet count, coagulation profile, prothrombin/activated partial thromboplastin time, autoimmune markers, antiphospholipid antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, protein C and S levels, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human immunodeficiency virus, and serum homocysteine were all within normal limits. However, she had dyslipidemia in her lipid panel. In her genetic screening, there was only a PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism, but not the other (Factor V Leiden, methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase, prothrombin G2010A) mutations."
"We recently examined a 25-year-old woman with complaints of poor visual acuity, glare, and starburst in her left eye (LE). She had previously undergone a microkeratome laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) procedure 2 months ago for a refractive error of -8.00 Ds/-1.25 Dc × 140 in the right eye (RE) and -8.00 Ds/-1.00 Dc × 30 in the LE. Her unaided distance visual acuity (UDVA) was 20/20 in the RE and 20/125 improving to 20/80 with -1.50 Dc × 170 in the LE. On slit-lamp biomicroscopy, the LASIK flaps in both eyes were well apposed, but she had an anterior to mid-stromal macular corneal scar in the LE located nasally near the margin of the flap hinge []. The flap hinge was nasal and appeared to be close to the visual axis []. The rest of the anterior segment and posterior segment findings in both the eyes were unremarkable.\nWhat do you think happened?\nCentral toxic keratopathy Diffuse lamellar keratitis LASIK flap hinge ablation Interface fluid syndrome."
"A 25-year-old male presented to us with chief complaints of itching in both eyes (OU) for the past one month. He had no past history of eye rubbing, ocular or systemic allergies. Family history of KC was absent. His unaided visual acuity was 6/12 OU. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with spectacles was 6/6 OU with Plano/-2DC at 65°OD and Plano/-3.25DC at 120° OS. Intraocular pressure measured by non-contact tonometer was 12 mm of Hg OU. On slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination, OU few papillae on upper palpebral conjunctiva, Vogt's striae OS were documented. Rest of the anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination were normal OU.\nCorneal Topography was performed on Pentacam-HR (Oculus Optikgeraete GmbH; Wetzlar, Germany) and Epithelial mapping was done on MS-39 (ASOCT CSO Italia) [Figs. and ]; 3 scans each to ensure the repeatability of the scans. Based on the corneal topography, a diagnosis of stage 2 KC OU was established according to the Amsler Krumeich classification and the ABCD grading was A2B3C0D0 OU.[]\nAs the patient had a BCVA of 6/6 and a low risk of progression according to our previously published nomogram, no surgical intervention was planned.[] He was prescribed a combination of Trehalose and sodium hyaluronate 1% eye drops (Trehalube eye drop, Micro Labs, Bengaluru, India) OU four times a day for 6 months along with Loteprednol Etabonate 0.5% OU (Lotepred eye drops, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Mumbai, India) in tapering dose for 20 days.\nAt 8 months follow-up, there was no change in refraction OU. The patient was not using contact lenses, or had any complains of eye rubbing in interim period between the two visits. Pentacam-HR (3 scans) comparative maps revealed increase in keratometric values, with a difference of more than 0.5 Dioptre (D) along with 3 points of steepening in the cone region indicative of progression OU.[] [] On MS-39 (3 scans), there was enhanced concentric epithelial thickening around the area of the cone with an increase in the minimum epithelial thickness from the baseline scans. However, there were no changes in the stromal elevation or posterior elevation [Fig. and ]. Thus, the signs of steepening on pentacam comparative map may be attributed solely to the remodeling of epithelium around the cone region. The epithelial remodeling is masquerading as progression, hence a diagnosis of pseudoprogression was made."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to our refractive clinic complaining of decreased vision after 4 years of femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK done at our center. At the time of LASIK surgery, she had a stable refractive error of moderate myopia of -3.0 DS/-0.5 DC × 90° in the right eye and -4.0 DS in the left eye. The patient had a thinnest CT of 589 µ and 594 µ in the right and left eye, respectively and tomography done on Orbscan did not show any suspicious parameters, though the best fit sphere and posterior elevation values could be considered as being borderline []. The patient had an uneventful Femtosecond laser-assisted (Visumax – Carl Zeis Meditech, Germany) LASIK with Excimer Laser (Wavelight EX500- Alcon, USA). The flap thickness was 120 µ in both eyes with an optic zone of 6.5 mm in both eyes. The residual bed thickness was 386 µ and 370 µ in the right and left eye, respectively. She had an uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20/20 in both eyes and had a routine postoperative course over the next 3 months without any adverse events. She presented 4 years later after 6 months of delivering a baby, having noticed a slight decrease in her vision in the left eye in the latter part of her pregnancy. Her UCVA was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/60 in the left eye improving to 20/40p with -1.0 DS/-1.0 DC × 140. In the right eye, the Kmax was 43.3 D and thinnest pachymetry was 483 µ and the left eye showed a Kmax of 46.5 D and thinnest pachymetry of 477 µ. The Oculyzer scan of the left eye showed a mild elevation in posterior float and the possibility of ectasia was considered. As she had a chalazion in her left upper lid, she was asked to review after 1 month. However, she returned to the clinic after 5 months with her UCVA having dropped to 20/100 in the left eye even though her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and refraction remained the same. The left eye tomography scans showed further increase in K readings with Kmax of 54.4 D and with thinnest pachymetry of 457 µ with elevation in both the anterior and posterior elevation maps with clear evidence of ectasia in the left eye []. Collagen cross-linking was done for the left eye after which no progression was seen till 1 year of follow-up."
"A female in her 20s with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) was referred to our centre for autologous stem cell transplantation. She was diagnosed with stage 2 HL in 2016 and underwent chemoradiotherapy, attaining complete remission. She relapsed in 2019 with a recurrent mediastinal mass and widespread lymphadenopathy. She underwent salvage chemotherapy with bendamustine and brentuximab (BB), which was uneventful except for a grade 1 cutaneous adverse drug reaction (CADR) to BB affecting 5% of her body surface area. This resolved with topical steroids and antihistamines. She had no other significant medical or surgical history. Medication on admission for stem cell harvesting included chlorpheniramine 4 mg two times per day, mometasone 0.1% lotion two times per day for her previous CADR and acyclovir 400 mg two times per day for prophylaxis against herpes zoster.\nThe patient went on to receive mobilisation chemotherapy with ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide. Pegfilgrastim was administered on days 5 and 11. On day 11, she was admitted with a fever of 38.3°C and pain in her legs. Examination revealed bilateral scattered tender, indurated subcutaneous nodules over her shins with mild overlying erythema, approximately 3–5 cm in diameter (). There was a residual dry scaly excoriated hyperpigmented rash from the previous CADR."
"A 25-year-old woman with no medical history visited our hospital with left eye ptosis and diplopia. She was working as a nurse in a pediatric clinic and had, therefore, been vaccinated for prevention of influenza. She developed symptoms 2 weeks after the influenza vaccination. She did not complain of ocular pain or other neurological symptoms. In addition, she had no clinical signs or symptoms of possible autoimmune disorders like lupus or Sjogren's syndrome. She was a social drinker and a nonsmoker. She had no family history of neurological diseases.\nOn general physical examination, her blood pressure was 132/74 mm Hg. Neurological examination revealed a dilated pupil in the left eye, severe ptosis, and diplopia with reduced adduction, elevation, and depression of the left eye, which suggested complete left oculomotor palsy (Fig. ). Other neurological examinations showed no abnormalities.\nThe blood tests, including the complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolytes, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, were normal. Autoantibodies for vasculitis, including anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-nuclear, cardiolipin, ds-DNA, phospholipid, and Ro/La antibodies were negative. Anti-ganglioside antibodies (IgG, IgM) including GM1, GD1b, and GQ1b were also negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed the following results: red blood cells 0/UL, leukocytes 0/UL, protein 38 mg/dL, glucose (CSF) 65 mg/dL, and glucose (serum) 102 mg/L (ratio 0.64). The brain computed tomography (CT) and brain CT angiography were unremarkable. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed enhancement of the left oculomotor nerve (Fig. ).\nThe patient was treated with Solu-Medrol® (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) 1,000 mg/day i.v. for 5 days. The pupillary light reflex was restored after 3 days of high-dose steroid therapy. On the following day, ptosis and diplopia began to improve. After 4 weeks of persistent symptoms, gradual and complete recovery was achieved."
"A 25-year-old G2P1 parturient with no major co-morbidity except for the history of lidocaine allergy in childhood presented to our hospital with 37 weeks’ gestation in an active phase of labor. She did not remember the exact details of allergic reaction as it “occurred in childhood”. Her airway exam was reassuring. Though direct challenge can be tried with non-proven local anesthetic allergy, or skin testing, it was not planned considering the risk for the mother and the baby in case of anaphylaxis. We discussed at length the possible pain relief modalities including the risk and benefits of chloroprocaine PCEA and remifentanil intravenous (IV) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The patient opted for chloroprocaine PCEA after understanding the risks and the benefits. Standard ASA monitors were applied, an 18G IV was placed, and the patient was prepared for the procedure with the code cart in the labor room. The obstetric team was made aware to be on standby if anaphylaxis occurred and stat delivery of the fetus was necessary. We performed skin testing with 0.1 mL of chloroprocaine subcutaneously, followed by 0.5mL and 1 mL of the same, no allergic reactions were noted, and the vital signs were stable 2 mL of chloroprocaine 1.5% (Nescaine MPF) was used to numb the skin. The epidural catheter placement was performed easily, and 8 mL of chloroprocaine 1.5% was used as a loading dose. A pump for patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) at a basal rate of 12 mL/hr of chloroprocaine 1.5%+ fentanyl 2mcg/mL with optional boluses of 5 mL every 20 minutes was started. She was closely monitored for any symptoms of allergic reactions. She was comfortable, with no symptoms of allergic reactions, and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery, after eight hours without issues. Mother and baby were discharged home on the third postpartum day. Our patient was advised to visit an allergist six months post-delivery."
"PS, a 25-year-old, nulliparous married female from urban background presented with sudden onset withdrawn behavior, reduced sleep, refusal to eat, and poor hygiene for the past 3 days. These symptoms started 2 days after the start of her menstrual cycle, when she had complained of dysmenorrhea and weakness. There was one similar episode 3 years ago which had occurred during menstruation and lasted for 4 days before resolving with treatment; the details of which were not available. Her onset of menarche was at 15 years, she had irregular menstrual cycle which lasted for 5–7 days, and it was associated with dysmenorrhea. There was no significant medical history. On examination, she was perplexed, with incoherent speech and persecutory and referential delusions. She was started on olanzapine 10 mg/day and clonazepam, and her symptoms improved significantly, and she achieved complete remission in 8 days. She was lost to follow-up for 6 months, after which she presented back in the clinic with third person auditory hallucinations, command hallucinations, and delusions of reference during the time of her menstrual cycle. It was learnt that in the last 6 months, her family had refused to continue treatment as they thought she was “making up the symptoms” during her menstrual cycle, so that she would avoid doing any housework at her in-laws' place. They claimed that she was completely normal at other times. It was only when she tried to attack her husband after being commanded by a voice that the family brought her back to the clinic. She was admitted, and olanzapine 10 mg/day was restarted. Within days, she showed remarkable improvement. Routine biochemistry and gonadal hormonal assay were unremarkable. Psychological assessments revealed the presence of emotionally unstable personality traits. She responded to medication and was discharged after 1 month with advice to follow-up for regular treatment."
"A prenatal ultrasound performed at 20 weeks of gestation in a 25-year-old female patient (gravida 1, para 1) revealed a fetus with an oral mass. In April 2019 at 38 weeks of gestation, the patient was admitted to the Shanghai Children’s Hospital and gave birth vaginally to a boy (birth weight, 3150g). At birth, a mass arose from the oropharynx. Fortunately, the mass did not cause severe respiratory distress, but it did cause feeding difficulties. A successful staged resection of an oropharyngeal teratoma was performed (). Histological examination showed a mixed mature and immature (10%) true teratoma with no evidence of malignant changes. The diagnosis of a congenital epignathus was confirmed. There were no complications such as infection, bleeding or residual recurrence following surgery. After 1-year follow-up, there was no recurrence of the epignathus.\nThe clinical protocol used for both cases was established according to the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Shanghai Children’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (no. [2019].5). The parents or legal guardians of the two cases provided written informed consent for publication of the clinical data and images presented in this case report."
"A 25-year-old lady presented to the hospital with sudden onset of difficulty in breathing and palpitation, following spontaneous delivery outside one day back. There was no history of hypertension, diabetes, anemia, and fever, during the entire pregnancy period. The patient arrived in severe respiratory distress, with sweating and shallow breathing, and was immediately shifted to ICU. On examination, the patient was having tachypnea (RR-40/m), tachycardia (HR-130/m), BP (140/100 mm Hg), and bilateral basal crepitations. Cardiac auscultation findings were difficult to interpret as patient was uncooperative and restless. SPO was 84% in room air. Routine examination of blood, liver, and renal function test was normal. ABG showed hypoxemia, Nt-pro-BNP was mildly raised, and D-dimer was normal. The initial differential that was kept was that of fluid overload, pulmonary embolism, consolidation, and ARDS. However, bedside transthoracic echocardiography was not conclusive as a poor echo window was obtained and patient was unable to lie down supine for a considerable period of time on account of severe respiratory distress. Neither a CT pulmonary angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism was possible as patient was unstable to be shifted to the radiology department.\nECG revealed right axis deviation, RBBB, and a notch in the apex of the R wave in all inferior leads 2,3,aVF (crochetage sign) (). The findings of ECG are directed to the presence of atrial septal defect as crochetage sign is highly sensitive for ASD. The patient was treated with noninvasive BIPAP ventilation, IV diuretics, nitroglycerine injection, and broad-spectrum antibiotic. After stabilization, next day, transthoracic echocardiography was done, which showed dilated right ventricle, tricuspid regurgitation with right ventricular systolic pressure of 34 mm Hg, and presence of large ostium secundum ASD of 20 mm size with a left to right shunt (Video-A,B,C,D). The patient was discharged on the third day with advice to undergo closure of ASD at the earliest. She then underwent successful ASD device closure, and repeat ECG done 3 months later demonstrated complete disappearance of crochetage in inferior leads with the presence of RBBB ()."
"A 25-year-old Japanese man visited our clinic complaining of rashes on the right thigh. He had been engaged in chemical experiments, and 12 days before the visit (hereafter referred to as day 0), he had spilt alkyl bromide on his right thigh. On day 1–2, erythema with tiny vesicles had appeared on the thigh, and on around day 7, he had complained of fever and vomiting, and the erythema had spread over the trunk. He had visited a dermatologist nearby and then had been referred to our clinic (on day 12).\nHe presented uncircumscribed erythema on his right thigh (Fig. ). The erythema on the trunk had disappeared by this time. At the same time, we noticed that several warts on his left palm, which he had suffered from for years in spite of multiple cryotherapies, had turned brownish (Fig. , c). Histological analysis of the right thigh revealed massive infiltration of lymphocytes and vacuolar changes of the epidermis (Fig. , e). Based on these clinical and histological observations, we diagnosed him with contact dermatitis with systemic symptoms and prescribed a topical steroid (clobetasol propionate) ointment. The rashes on the thighs had disappeared by the visit on day 21, and by his next visit on day 50, all the VV on the palm had resolved (Fig. ). Based on this clinical course, we considered that the VV on his palm had spontaneously regressed due to an immunological mechanism."
Case 3: A 25 years old female who presented to the emergency department for evaluation of right flank pain after antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection.\nCases 1 and 3: Patients have no past medical problems.
"A 25-year-old woman working for Korean Air as a cabin crew member became ill on February 21, 2020, with symptoms of cough and a mild fever. She was examined for COVID-19 on February 24, 2020 and was confirmed positive the next day ().\nThorough epidemiologic investigations suggested in-flight disease transmission as the source of infection. On February 15, 2020, 39 Korean Catholic pilgrims boarded KE958 (B777) from Tel Aviv, Israel to Incheon, ROK. Soon after their return to ROK, 30 pilgrims were diagnosed with COVID-19. The flight attendant had worked during this flight. Moreover, there were no other identified sources. After the flight, she flew back and forth from Incheon, ROK, to Los Angeles, USA, between February 19 and February 22, 2020. On route from Los Angeles (February 20, KE012, A380), she began to feel ill and was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 on February 25, 2020 ()."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for liver transplantation for multiple hepatic masses that were incidentally discovered by imaging. He had previously been diagnosed with CHF on liver biopsy 14 years ago, and had received transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for portal hypertension at that time. He had no history of metabolic syndrome, alcohol intake or prior intake of androgens and his body mass index was 25.2 kg/m2. There was no evidence of other abnormalities associated with CHF, and there was no remarkable family history. Preoperative liver function tests were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase 35 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 29 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase 19 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 79 U/L, total bilirubin 4.2 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL. Serological tests for hepatitis B and C virus were negative. On computed tomography, there were multiple fat-containing nodules in both hepatic lobes.\nThe liver weighed 1,242 g, and sections revealed nine discrete tan-to-yellow nodules in both lobes, measuring 9.5 × 6.5 × 7.5 cm in the largest one. The background liver was firm with a reticular appearance (). On microscopic examination, the background liver showed the typical histological features of CHF: broad fibrous bands rimmed by small bile ductular structures with ductal plate malformation patterns (). The pathological findings of the nine nodules are summarized in and and . Six nodules were diagnosed as H-HCAs and the three smaller nodules as large regenerative nodule (LRN) or focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)-like nodules, based on the histo-pathological and immunohistochemical characteristics. Notably, although LFABP loss was seen in all six H-HCAs, nodules #1, #2, and #9 showed only patchy mild steatosis, and nodules #1 and #2 also demonstrated focal peliosis and mild ductular reaction. The remaining 4 H-HCAs demonstrated diffuse steatosis. On follow-up, the patient is currently well without evidence of recurrence."
"Patient 2, a 25-year-old male, was referred to us by the orthodontists for a recurring gingival enlargement associated with severe tooth migration evolving for several years (Fig. ). He had a family history of Crohn's disease. Oral and facial clinical exams also showed signs of labial hypertrophy with cheilitis and a cobblestone type of hypertrophy on the inner side of the cheeks (Fig. ).\nGingival biopsies were performed on both patients. Anatomopathological examination revealed a squamous papillomatous epithelium without cytonuclear atypia resting on an essentially lympho-plasmocytic inflammatory chorion. Giganto-cellular granulomas were found in both cases, without the presence of caseous necrosis. These typical forms of granulomas can be either isolated in the oral cavity or found in cases of systemic diseases such as IBD (Fig. ).\nAfter having the stability of her Crohn's disease reassessed by the gastroenterologist, topical dermocorticoids (Clobetasol, Dermoval®) were prescribed for patient 1. After 15 days of bi-daily application, complete clinical and symptomatic improvement was observed (Fig. ).\nFor patient 2, a complete endoscopic examination was carried out, revealing no signs of IBD lesions in the digestive tract. A local gingivectomy was carried out in order to remove the gingival overgrowth. Also, given the overall general clinical picture, this oral manifestation being considered as inaugural of the pathology, a preventive treatment with adalimumab (HUMIRA®) was introduced after a multidisciplinary meeting. No gingival recurrences were observed during the 18-month follow-up (Fig. ). However, an annual follow-up of the digestive tract was set up in order to monitor the appearance of intestinal symptoms since they can appear several years after the oral lesions."
"A 25-year-old male was referred to ophthalmology from the infectious diseases department with a complaint of painless blurred vision in both eyes for a few days. He denied headache, proximal muscle ache, or recent trauma. Medical history showed that the patient was diagnosed with XDR-TB on treatment with INH (300 mg/day) for 1 month, ethionamide (500 mg/twice per day) for 3 months, clofazimine (100 mg/day), moxifloxacin (400 mg/day), linezolid (600 mg/twice per day), cyscloserin (750 mg/day), and bedaquiline and pyridoxine (80 mg/day) for the past 5 months. Ocular history was unremarkable. The dosage of linezolid was increased to 1200 mg 3 weeks before the presentation.\nOn examination, visual acuity was 20/200 in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 17 mmHg in the right eye and 16 mmHg in the left eye. Ishihara color plate test revealed a decrease in color vision, mainly in the left eye (3 of 15 plates) while the right eye was (7 of 15 plates). Pupils were regular, round, and reactive without relative afferent pupillary defect. The anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Fundi showed blurred disk margins in both eyes with mild nasal elevation in the left eye. His visual field revealed ceco-central scotomas in both eyes []. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit was unremarkable. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy genetic testing was negative.\nOut of the medications he is using, we concluded that the patient had a drug-induced toxic optic neuropathy secondary to a high dose of linezolid. Therefore, after informing the primary team, we suggested substituting linezolid with another alternative and they decided to stop linezolid and continue the rest of the medications. Subsequently, the patient reported improvement of vision 1-week post discontinuation of linezolid. Visual acuity improved to 20/60 in both eyes. However, color vision did not improve within the same period and inversely worsened in the right eye (5 of 15 plates). Three months after the presentation, visual acuity improved remarkably to 20/25 in the right eye and 20/28 in the left eye. Furthermore, color vision was fully restored in both eyes (15 of 15 plates). Furthermore, examination of fundi showed mild temporal disk pallor more prominent in the left eye. Visual field testing was unremarkable []."
"A 25-year old female with intermediate-risk AML in CR underwent an allo-HSCT with BuCy myeloablative conditioning from her matched sibling. Her neutrophils engrafted by day +14. On day +34 she developed grade 3 aGvHD of the lower GI tract which was steroid refractory (SR). She did not respond to the addition of budesonide, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), mofetil mycophenolate or infliximab.\nThe current data regarding the use of FMT for the treatment of acute GI GvHD are limited to case reports and small case series (). A total of 58 described patients were treated with FMT for SR GI grade 2-4 aGvHD. The FMT source was an unrelated donor in 36 cases, a related donor – in six cases and in eight cases a commercial pooled highly diverse FMT was used. FMT was processed and either given fresh within a few hours of collection or it was frozen and later thawed before administration. FMT was administered orally as packed capsules, through a nasogastric/ nasoduodenal tube or an enema. Of 58 patients, 28 received FMT after two or more therapy lines, while 19 received it as second-line therapy right after steroid failure. Response was observed in 74% (43 of 58) of patients, with complete response in 57% (33 of 58) and partial response in 17% (10 of 58). Complete response was observed in 73% of patients receiving FMT as second-line therapy. Ten of the responding patients relapsed and 29 patients were alive at the last follow-up (54%; 29 of 54 patients with available data).\nResponse to treatment was seen within a median of 14 days (range: 3-28), with a median of two FMT (range: 1-7), and a median of 7 days between treatments (range: 2-60).\nInfectious complications occurred in 11 patients. Two had sepsis with bacteria not originating from FMT, and one patient developed diarrhea due to Norovirus that was traced to FMT. Other infections were attributed to the severe immunocompromised state of patients. However, a possible association with FMT could not be ruled out. In responding patients in whom the stool microbiome was sequenced post-FMT, it was found to be significantly more diverse and enriched with Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium compared to pre-FMT microbiome. Notably, the diversity increased only upon discontinuation of anti-anaerobic systemic antibiotic treatment, such as piperacillin-tazobactam. However, continuous use or re-initiating treatment with cefepime did not reduce FMT efficiency.\nThese results are highly encouraging and support FMT therapy to be relatively safe and effective in SR GI aGvHD."
"A 25-year-old female was referred to our hospital for cardiac evaluation. She had no previous medical history. She was asymptomatic. The clinical examination was normal. Accordingly, a complete transthoracic 2D echocardiography with color Doppler examination using Philips ultrasound machine (EPIQ-7) was performed. In parasternal short-axis view, the MV orifice showed an accessory tissue between both leaflets, but it was not clearly identified as two orifices []. Two papillary muscles were clearly visualized []. Apical two-chamber view showed the division of MV opening into 2 by an accessory tissue. The MV was functioning well (no regurgitation or stenosis). The other valves were normal in function and morphology. To obtain a detailed description of MV apparatus, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed using the same machine and X7 matrix probe that enabled to do 2D and 3D images at the same time. At mid-esophageal level, the MV orifice was divided into two unequal orifices with normal function [ and ]. The 3D en face view of MV from both atrial and ventricular aspects clearly showed that the MV orifice was divided by a complete anteroposterior bridge into two asymmetrical orifices. The orientation of leaflets from both atrial and ventricular aspects showed that each orifice had its own annulus, leaflets, and commissures []. 3D planimetry measurement of orifice area of the anterolateral one is 0.9 cm2 and the posteromedial one is 2.1 cm2 []. There were no other associated cardiac anomalies. Despite normal blood pressure and absence of radiofemoral pulse delay, it was important to exclude associated mild degree of coarctation. 2D echocardiography showed turbulent color flow across the descending aorta, but the maximum pressure gradient recorded by continuous Doppler was 12 mmHg. That is why computed tomography scan was performed to rule out associated coarctation. The diagnosis was established as an isolated congenital DOMV with normal valve function, and no further step is needed."
"A 25-year-old male consulted the outpatient clinic of our hospital complaining about back and thoracic pain with increasing intensity and an involuntary weight loss of about 5 kg during the preceding 2 months. Three years before, he had emigrated from Iraq to Germany and had travelled to his native country 1 year before admission. Occasionally, the patient had noted blood-expectorating cough. Upon admission, elevated serological inflammatory parameters were observed. A chest radiograph () and a subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan ( and ()) revealed a smoothly delineated cystic tumour with a maximal diameter of 9 cm in the lower lobe of the left lung with attenuation of contrast media in the periphery of the lesion, whereas the remainder lung parenchyma appeared inconspicuous. Radiologically, either a tuberculous cavern or echinococcosis was suspected. Bronchoscopy revealed no pathological changes. A mycobacterial infection could not be verified by PCR neither in the serum nor in a bronchoalveolar washing. Of note, serological testing for Echinococcus species was negative. Consequently, lobectomy of the affected lower left lobe was performed and submitted to the Institute of Pathology for diagnostic work-up.\nMacroscopically, the resected lobe showed a cystic lesion with a whitish fibrous rim containing turbid fluid (). The adjacent lung parenchyma appeared normal. Histomorphologically, the periphery of the cystic lesion showed a thick fibrous rim, consisting of an outer acellular laminated membrane and a germinal membrane with nucleated lining with numerous protoscolices with occasional hooklets ( and ()). During workup for frozen section, cytological smear preparations had been performed, which also clearly showed protoscolices and hooklets, facilitating the frozen section diagnosis. Some of the smears were later stained according to Papanicolau (). In the periphery of the lesion, the lung parenchyma was dystelectatic with numerous intraalveolar macrophages and occasional multinucleated giant cells. The adjacent lung appeared normal with regular bronchi and blood vessels. The pleura covering the lesion was oedematous and thickened with granulation tissue admixed with polymorph nuclear granulocytes and covered by fibrin. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient before submission of this case report. The preparation of the clinical data was performed according to the rules outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki."
"A 25-year-old male amateur soccer goalkeeper saved a hard shot with his right hand. He also had no prior experience of FOOSH or punching the ball during the game. He presented to our hospital with a history of the right wrist pain 10 months after the injury. Physical examination showed reduced range of motion of his wrist and tenderness of the anatomical snuffbox. Plain radiographs suggested a middle third fracture of the scaphoid (), and 3D CT showed a type 1-B3 fracture by Moritomo’s modified Herbert classification [] (-). Using the same dorsal approach as in case 1, the nonunion site was curetted and bone harvested from the iliac crest was grafted, followed by one headless screw and a Kirschner wire in the distal-to-proximal direction (). He was placed in a thumb spica splint after the operation for 8 weeks and bone union was noted (). He returned to work without wrist pain.\nWe investigated the relationship between the fracture line and wrist position using a fresh cadaver (). The experiment revealed that the fracture line of the scaphoid matched the dorsal edge of the articular surface of the radius with the wrist in 30° of dorsiflexion and 20° of ulnar deviation."
"A 25-year-old male presented with progressive exertional dyspnea with palpitation for 1 year. A month ago, he developed an episode of orthopnea, pedal edema associated with icterus that was managed conservatively. He was diagnosed on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with bicuspid aortic valve with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and advised for early surgical intervention.\nOn the day of surgery after standard anesthesia induction, intubation, and maintenance, TEE was done with real-time three-dimensional enabled probe (X7-2t with ie33, Philips Ultrasound, Bothell, WA, USA), which revealed a severely calcified bicuspid aortic valve with severe AS, severe aortic regurgitation [ and ] with dilated left ventricle with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 18%. During routine complete examination with standard TEE views, left atrium (LA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) were found to be enlarged. Spontaneous echogenic contrast (SEC) was seen in LA. A mass was seen in the LAA with morphologically normal mitral valve. The mass was sessile with irregular borders, homogenous echogenicity measuring 2.2 × 1.4 cm [ and ]. Patient was in sinus rhythm. After placing patient on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), aortotomy was done; root cardioplegia given, and aortic valve replaced with regent mechanical valve size 25. Left atriotomy was done and the mass, which was identified grossly as thrombus, was removed and internal plication of LAA done []. Patient was weaned off CPB with adrenaline, nor adrenaline, dobutamine, and milrinone support and had an uneventful postoperative course. Postoperative TEE showed an improvement in ejection fraction to 43% and a reduction in mean systolic gradient across aortic valve from 64 to 4 mmHg [ and ]."
"A 25-year-old male patient was admitted to Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital on 7 October 2014\nbecause of a left neck mass that had progressively enlarged after 5 months of anti-TB\ntreatment.\nIt was 5 months before the patient found the left neck mass, which had a diameter of 2 cm\nwithout obvious inducement. There were no obvious abnormalities on the lung CT or any\nrespiratory symptoms. He attended the Outpatient Department of Surgery at Hangzhou Red\nCross Hospital for a puncture biopsy of the left neck mass. Pathological examination of\nthe mass indicated a large number of lymphocytes and clusters of epithelioid cells in the\nsmear, and lymph node granulomatous lesions were initially considered. These findings were\nsuggestive of lymph node TB. However, after HRZE was administered, the mass progressively\nenlarged with local skin ulceration and abscess. He was admitted to our hospital for\nfurther treatment.\nThe physical examination results are described below. There was a bulging mass that was\n6 × 5 × 2 cm3 in size on the left neck II area with an unclear boundary, mild\ntenderness, and no redness on the skin surface. There were two visible skin bursts on the\nleft neck V area with a few light yellow secretions, mild swelling surrounding the tissue,\nand mild redness on the surface of the skin. There were several enlarged lymph nodes in\nthe right submaxillary neck with a diameter of about 1 cm, a clear boundary, and no sense\nof fluctuation.\nAfter admission, a neck-enhanced CT indicated RPA and oropharyngeal stenosis (). The electronic\nlaryngoscope indicated mucosal eminence in the left pharyngeal crypt. A cervical spine MRI\nindicated abnormal signals in cervical 2 and 3 vertebral bodies, vertebral TB with\nparavertebral abscess formation, and abnormal signals in the left cervical soft tissue\n(). Lung CT indicated\nno obvious abnormalities.\nThe patient received HR after admission. On 15 October 2014, he underwent a\nB-ultrasound-guided puncture and drainage of the RPA. Results of an Xpert® MTB/RIF of the\nabscess were positive, and a rifampin-resistant gene was not detected. He was diagnosed\nwith tuberculous RPA. On 6 November 2014, re-examination of the neck enhanced CT indicated\nthat the RPA had resolved (). He was treated with HR for 12 months. No abnormalities were observed when\nanti-TB treatment was discontinued. To date, he is considered fully recovered."
"A 25-year-old lady presented with pain and swelling in upper abdomen of one-month duration. Pain was dull aching and burning in nature. The swelling was insidious in onset, approximately 10cms in diameter. Her appetite was normal. Upper GI Endoscopy showed external compression from anterior wall of the stomach. Ultrasonography and CECT of abdomen showed a large heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion arising from anterior wall of the body of stomach. Pre-operatively, a diagnosis of GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumour) was made. At operation, an exophytic growth emanating from the body and antrum of stomach was seen with no infiltration to adjacent organs was noted. Distal gastrectomy [] with roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy was done. Histopathological [] and immuno-histochemical examinations confirmed the diagnosis of IMT. The tumour was weakly positive for SMA (Smooth muscle actin) and vimentin. CD117, CD34, and S100 were negative.\nPatient recovered well and was doing well till 6 months after surgery."
"The patient was a 25-year-old female and had her first menstruation when she was 15 years old. She has four living children and the gravida was four.\nThe patient presented to our emergency department with severe pain right lower quadrant of the abdomen and vomiting. She had a vaginal delivery at home five days ago. The patient did not receive antenatal care and ultrasound (US) was not performed. On physical examination, her temperature was 37.8° Celsius. She was in severe distress due to abdominal pain. Her abdomen was rebound tenderness, guarding, and moderately distended. Bowel sounds were present but hypoactive. At the time of admission, blood pressure was 116/72 mm Hg, heart rate was 110 beats/min, respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min. Laboratory investigations in emergency department showed that she had white cell count of 9.60 × 109/L and raised C-reactive protein of 34 g/dL. Bedside transabdominal US as the first imaging modality revealed well-defined hypoechoic lesion with internal echoes and posterior acoustic shadow in the right adnexa of the uterus, having no vascularity in color Doppler. Furthermore, there was also an echogenic mural nodule compatible with the Rokitansky nodule (dermoid plug) within the heterogeneous lesion (). An abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed that the appendix is normal and the uterus increased in size (). Furthermore, CT demonstrated a heterogeneous density lesion containing subtle peripheral calcification, fat and fluid density areas in the right adnexa consistent with a MCT ().\nWe performed a small transverse incision that allowed the externalization of the ovarian mass containing hair, sebum, and calcifications in the right adnexa (). During the operation, dark, enlarged and nonviable ovarian tissue was detected. There was no cyst rupture. We then carried out a right total salpingo-oophorectomy. The uterus and contralateral adnexa were macroscopically normal. Surgical specimen and histopathological examination showed that unilocular cysts filled with sebaceous material, hair and focal solid area, extensive hemorrhage, congestion, dilated blood vessels, and ischemia of mucosa and parenchyma (). The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged home five days after her operation pain-free. The abdominal US performed two weeks after discharge demonstrated no pathological finding in the right adnexa."
"A 25-year-old, 17 week pregnant female, presented with severe lower back pain radiating posterolaterally into her right lower extremity of 3 months duration. When she failed conservative therapy, an MRI was performed that showed a right-sided L4-L5 disc herniation with severe canal stenosis. As she exhibited significant unilateral deficits (motor 4/5 quadriceps/extensor hallucis longus/dorsiflexor), she underwent a right-sided L4-L5 microdiscectomy. This was performed in the prone position and utilized a single lateral C-arm fluoroscopic image (e.g., using as low as reasonably achievable [ALARA]/shielding for the fetus-lead aprons over her abdomen) to confirm the correct vertebral level []. Postoperatively, the patient’s symptoms/signs fully resolved, a finding confirmed in clinic 10 days later. 22 weeks later, she delivered a healthy full-term baby girl."
"A 25-year-old male originally presented with mid-back pain of 2 months duration. After a T8 thoracic CT-guided biopsy, he was diagnosed/treated for TB spondylitis with bed rest and appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, 1 month following his initial presentation, he developed worsening of his mid-back pain (VAS score 8), chest pain, shortness of breath, and a progressive lower extremity paraparesis (3/5 proximal and 4/5 distal).\nThe chest X-ray showed a pleural effusion, while the thoracic spine X-ray demonstrated T8 vertebral collapse. Further, the thoracic spine MRI showed a posterior epidural collection extending from T7 to T9 resulting in cord compression. Of interest, lumbar X-rays and lumbar MR scan both demonstrated an additional although smaller, asymptomatic L3 vertebral body lesion [ and ].\nThe patient’s progressive myelopathy prompted a T8, T9 laminectomy that included a culture/biopsy of the lesion, epidural debridement, and T6-T10 pedicle screw fixation []. Notably, at the T8 level, there was a nonpurulent, soft, grayish-white material found in the center of the T8 vertebral body that appeared more consistent with tumor than tubercular infection.\nThe pathology showed only inflammatory granulation tissue, and the staining for all organisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), was negative [].\nPostoperatively, the patient’s back pain (VAS score 2) improved, and he showed significant neurological recovery (e.g., 4/5 function proximally, 5/5 distally). However, within 3 days, he developed an increased left-sided pleural effusion (1700 cc). Tissue culture and MTB DNA reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of the fluid were negative. Four weeks postoperatively, when he returned with dyspnea and cough, the PET-CT scan revealed a metabolically active osteolytic lesion predominantly involving the T8 vertebral body, with extension into the T7, T9, and T11 vertebral bodies, involving the left 7th rib, as well as multiple other sites [].\nBiopsy of the left 7th rib and immunohistochemistry studies confirmed that the lesion was an EMS []. At that point, the patient was referred for chemotherapy (e.g., cytarabine + daunorubicin). Now 1 year following the completion of chemotherapy, he remains asymptomatic, and the EMS has not yet recurred."
"A 25-year-old Chinese man first experienced low back pain and radicular pain in May 2017. The pain begam spontaneously, worsened after long car drives, and was accompanied by lumbar discomfort. Subsequently, he experienced left gluteal and left leg pain along with paresthesia in his posterior left leg. He had received acupuncture treatment in other hospitals, but his symptoms worsened; thus, 2 months later, he visited our hospital. The patient was 185 cm tall and weighed 70 kg. His body mass index (BMI) was 20.4 kg/m2, and there was no history of cigarette smoking or alcohol abuse, and no other relevant medical history. On admission, he had a pain score of 6 on a visual analog scale. Physical examination indicated left L3–L5 paraspinal muscle tenderness and L4–S1 percussive radicular pain, extending from the left gluteus to the back of the left leg and the sole of the ipsilateral foot. Let muscle strength and tone appeared normal, and the patellar and ankle reflexes in both lower limbs were symmetrical. Lasegue test results were 30° and 75° for the left and right legs, respectively. The Naffziger test and the test of abdominal external pressure both yielded positive results. The patient underwent lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that revealed a large left-sided paracentral disc herniation at the L5/S1 intervertebral space, compressing the traversing S1 nerve root and resulting in spinal stenosis, consistent with his symptoms ().\nThe patient was advised to undergo surgical treatment using percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy; however, he declined because of fear of surgery. Therefore, only physiotherapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed. He underwent low-intensity transcutaneous electric neuromuscular stimulation (TENS; 25 Hz, 200 µs, 50 mA, for 30 minutes) over the painful areas of his back and left leg daily, and he was prescribed 75 mg of Voltaren (diclofenac sodium sustained-release tablets, 75 mg per capsule; Novartis, Peking, China) once daily. The patient also received three weekly epidural steroid injections (ESIs). The treatment regimen is summarized in .\nAfter receiving the third ESI, the patient’s pain subsided, and he was discharged. He was followed-up intermittently at our outpatient department, and the symptoms persisted. Four months after he was discharged, his symptoms improved considerably. Two years later, the patient visited our department and stated that he had no symptoms of low back pain or sciatica. A second MRI was performed, revealing regression of the L5/S1 disc herniation (). The patient was monitored for another 8 months, and lumbar spine MRI revealed no recurrence (). This case shows that even a large disc herniation can resolve gradually."
"A 25-year-old male initially presented with a melanoma on the left scalp with cervical and inguinal adenopathy. After biopsy confirmed metastatic disease with BRAF V600 mutation, the treatment option was debated between targeted agents and immunotherapy. In the hope of a long-term remission, it was decided to treat with immunotherapy. As ipilimumab was the only approved agent at the time, this treatment was initiated and four cycles were completed. Two years later, the patient developed a new subcutaneous nodule on his back. The biopsy confirmed a subcutaneous metastasis and the positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed an 8 mm lesion at the surface of the spleen. Given the progression of his disease, he received a treatment of pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, for a total of 15 cycles. The best response achieved on treatment was a partial response. At his 10th cycle of pembrolizumab, the patient presented subjective morning stiffness and edema in the legs and hands, as well as pain in both knees. The patient later experienced range of motion restriction, mainly preventing him from closing his hands. Cutaneous examination revealed erythema, edema as well as cutaneous sclerosis involving metacarpal joints and upward toward the wrist as well as distal legs up to the calves. Pitting edema was prominent on the lower legs; however, Stemmer’s sign was negative which entails pinching and tenting the dorsal tissues of the foot. There was a positive prayer sign. No groove sign was noted. No calcinosis nor telangiectasias.\nLaboratory tests revealed a progressive eosinophilia over 6 months, increasing from 700 cells/mm3 to 3400 cells/mm3. Skin biopsy of the second finger of the left hand and lateral malleolus of the left ankle revealed chronic subcutaneous inflammation, fibrosis of the dermis and infiltration of the fascia with mononucleated cells, confirming the diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis (shown in ). The use of pembrolizumab was discontinued at that time after a total of 15 cycles. Systemic steroids were offered but declined as spontaneous resolution was already underway with drug cessation. A complete resolution of symptoms and eosinophilia was reached within 4 months without corticosteroid treatment. Despite 45 weeks of exposure to pembrolizumab, the patient still managed to reach a complete remission of the immune-related adverse effect. A radiological follow-up with PET scans was undertaken after treatment discontinuation. The disease remained stable for 18 months. Then, the patient became symptomatic due to a rapidly evolving intraabdominal relapse and was started on targeted therapy with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors."
"A 25-year-old primigravida presented to the antenatal outpatient department with bleeding per vaginum at 23 weeks period of gestation. She had threatened abortion at 8 weeks period of gestation for which she was on progesterone support. She was referred to our institute when she had a second episode of bleeding per vaginum at 23 weeks period of gestation. On examination, her vitals were within normal limits. Uterus corresponds to the 28 weeks period of gestation. Foetal heart rate was 148 bpm. On speculum examination, there was no local cause for antepartum haemorrhage. Ultrasound showed a foetus of 24 weeks period of gestation with polyhydramnios. Placenta was posterior reaching up to os with a well-defined lobulated hypoechoic lesion of 6.2 cm × 4.4 cm at the edge of the placenta, an umbilical cord was attached to it []. The lesion was highly vascular on Doppler imaging. The amniotic fluid index was 22. Diagnosis of placenta previa with chorioangioma was made. On magnetic resonance imaging, placenta was located posteriorly along the left lateral wall reaching up to os. There was T2 hypointense lesion noted at the cord insertion site of 6.4 cm × 4.1 cm. She was on regular follow-up for foetal growth monitoring as chorioangioma is associated with a complication of foetal growth restriction. The middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity was 1.1 multiples of median for that gestational age. Patient was admitted at 30 weeks period of gestation in view of antepartum haemorrhage. She received steroids for foetal lung maturity. Three days after admission she had preterm labour and bleeding per vaginum. Emergency lower uterine segment caesarean section was done. Live born girl baby of 1.2 kg was delivered with Apgar of 7 and 9. Placenta was posterior reaching up to os. Another mass of about 6 cm × 5 cm was present over the internal os attached to the main placental mass. There was retro placental clot of 50 cc. Placenta was 15 cm × 16 cm × 4 cm with a weight of 530 g. On gross examination, there was a separate mass of about 6 cm × 5 cm was seen in the foetal surface of the placenta []. The umbilical cord was attached to it. It was soft in consistency and red tan on the cut surface. On histopathological examination, there was evidence of chorioangiosis in the form of more than 10 capillaries in 10 terminal villi confirming the diagnosis of placental chorioangioma []. The patient was discharged with the baby on day 5 in stable condition. On postpartum follow-up, mother and baby are doing well."
"A 25-yr-old woman from Darbid Village in Delfan County in Lorestan Province, Iran. She was pregnant and had a history of abdominal and back pain, sore throat and consumptions of aquatic plants especially “Balmak” in a recent month. She had no significant weight loss and cutaneous manifestation. All diagnostic measures were conducted similar to previous case. The patient’s related sequence with accession number MF187502 was recorded at the GenBank. After treatment, following up of the patient was performed after 1, 3 and 6-months and stool exam was negative."
"A 25-year-old nulligravida visited the emergency room with severe abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant. The urologist examined her first and ruled out the possibility of renal stones or other urological disorders. She had a history of erratic severe lower abdominal pain refractory to medical treatment. She showed a tender abdomen without rebound tenderness or costovertebral tenderness. Pelvic ultrasound revealed a 3-cm hypoechogenic mass on the left side of the uterus, which did not communicate with the endometrial cavity. The presumptive diagnosis of pelvic MRI was a unicornuate uterus with a rudimentary horn containing hemorrhage (). However, in the operative field, a smooth protruding mass was found on the left anterior wall of the uterus, with both ovaries and tubes grossly intact. We also ruled out unicornuate uterus by confirming that the uterine cavity and ostia were normal, using hysteroscopy. Laparoscopic mass excision was performed. On pathological examination, the cyst wall was lined with endometrial glandular epithelium and stromal cells. In the surrounding myometrium, no other adenomyotic lesion was found (). The postoperative period was uneventful. Until now, she has not complained of dysmenorrhea or abdominal pain after surgery."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the clinic complaining of poor visual acuity since childhood, night-blindness, and progressive peripheral vision loss in both eyes (OU). The patient also had a history of post-axial polydactyly in both feet (). Ophthalmic evaluation was remarkable for a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/400 OU.\nInfrared fundus photography (Optos, Inc.) showed a “salt-and-pepper” appearance surrounding the macula, bone-spicule retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hyperplasia, paravenous RPE hyperplasia, and arteriolar attenuation OU ( and ). Fundus autofluorescence showed macular autofluorescence with a surrounding granular hypoautofluorescence and an additional hyperautofluorescent zone OU ( and ). Macular optical coherence tomography revealed decreased macular thickness of 212 microns and 199 microns in the right (OD) and left eye (OS), respectively. Visual field testing (30–2) revealed a mean deviation of −31.52 dB (p<0.5%) and −33.04 dB (p<0.5%) in OD and OS, respectively. Full-field ERG results showed non-recordable scotopic ERG responses and diminished photopic ERG responses OU, consistent with progressive rod-cone dystrophy.\nSaliva sample was sent for genetic testing. Full-gene sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis using next-generation sequencing, covering select non-coding variants, coding exons and 10–20 base pairs of adjacent intronic sequence (Invitae Corporation, San Francisco, California), was positive for a single pathogenic heterozygous mutation in the BBS1 gene of the variant c.1169T>G (p.Met390Arg). He had five additional variants of unknown uncertain (VUS) at the ADGVR1, CACNA2D4, COL2A1, IMPG1, and MKKS genes ()."
"A 25-year-old female, a frontline healthcare worker with no comorbidities, presented with fever and mild respiratory symptoms of 5 days duration. She tested positive for COVID RT-PCR and was hospitalized. She was stable and her general and systemic examination was normal, except for fever. Saturation on room air was 98%. HRCT thorax showed <10% involvement of the lungs. Her CRP, ferritin, LDH, and ESR were slightly raised and D-dimer was >15,000. The rest of the biochemical parameters were normal except for a total count of 16,500/mm3. She was treated with ivermectin, Doxy, low molecular weight heparin, and vitamins. Intravenous ceftriaxone was given for a day in view of fever and leukocytosis but was stopped the next day as her fever subsided, counts declined, and the serum procalcitonin was normal. On day 10, at the time of discharge, she complained of pain and mild swelling of the right hand, just above the wrist. A USG Doppler showed a 3.7 cm thrombus in the right cephalic vein."
"Mr MN, a 25-year-old male, unmarried, educated up to pre-university college, hailing from\nOdisha, presented along with police personnel under court order. He was found wandering in\nthe street, with poor self-care and disruptive behavior, in the Mysore district of\nKarnataka. He was diagnosed with Intellectual Developmental Disorder and psychosis. After a\nfew days of treatment, his illness started improving and he gave some information about\nfamily details and village name in Nayagarth, Odisha. He was referred to a multidisciplinary\nteam (i.e., psychiatrists, psychiatric social workers, psychologists, and psychiatric\nnurses) for tracing the family and rehabilitation. With the available information, the team\ncontacted the District Superintendent of Police to help trace the family and in\nreintegration.\nSubsequently, the family was traced and contacted through the police. A family member\nrevealed over the phone that the patient had run away from home two years ago, and the\nfamily had filed a missing case in the local police station. The family members were\nemotionally attached to him, and they were very eager to know about the patient’s health\ncondition. The family members were willing to take him back to Odisha. Due to the COVID-19\npandemic, there were no train or bus services available for the family members to travel\nfrom Odisha to Bengaluru. Moreover, the family was not in a financial position to come to\nBengaluru. Currently, the patient is staying in the hospital’s closed ward, functioning well\nand engaging in the ward activities. The team is facilitating regular interaction between\nthe patient and family members over the telephone. The family members have assured to take\nback the patient home after the resumption of the train services."
A 25-year-old male presented with asymptomatic lesions on left cheek for the past 6 months. He also had history of acne. Patient reported resting on left side of face for long hours. Cutaneous examination showed follicular closely grouped papules on left cheek []. Also seen were few inflammatory lesions of acne.\nPolarized dermoscopy done with a videodermoscope (Dinolite digital microscope (Model AM7115MZT) showed similar findings of dilated follicular openings with plugging []. Patient was diagnosed as anserine folliculosis and advised similar treatment and precautions as in the previous case.
"A 25-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with a complaint of persistent progressive, non-postural headache for 3 days. The headache was insidious in onset and was not associated with nausea, vomiting, impairment of consciousness, focal weakness, or numbness. Sixteen days prior to the presentation, she had delivered a baby via LSCS after spinal anesthesia. It was reported that while performing the spinal anesthesia, single dural puncture was made using 25 gauge spinal needle. She did not have any history of trauma during or after her pregnancy. She had no history of pre-eclampsia, connective tissue disorder during her pregnancy, and her preoperative hematological, serological, and coagulation studies were normal. Following the spinal anesthesia and LSCS, she did not have any reported complications. Her neurological examination at the time of presentation was unremarkable.\nComputed tomography (CT) scan of the head was performed, which revealed up to 0.9 cm thick hypodense CSDH in right fronto-parieto-temporal convexity with some degree of mass effect and left-sided midline shift measuring about 0.6 cm from the center (Figure ). The cerebral CT arteriogram and cerebral venogram study were normal. Preoperative hematological and coagulation studies were normal. The patient subsequently underwent a right frontoparietal burr hole and evacuation of the hematoma under general anesthesia without complications. On her third postoperative day, the patient was discharged home."
"A 25-year-old Hindu unmarried man with unremarkable family and personal history but with past two episodes of suggestive catatonia presented with a 3-day history of remaining mute, maintaining a posture for long and refusing to interact with others along with refusal to eat and drink. His initial mental status examination (MSE) revealed catatonia (mutism, negativism and posturing) (Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) score=16), and it precluded further examination of his affect, thought and perception. He was admitted, and on investigations, his haematological and biochemical parameters (complete haemogram; renal, hepatic and thyroid function tests; serum electrolytes; creatinine phosphokinase) and MRI of his brain were within the normal range. He was initially managed with the injection of lorazepam 4 to 8 mg/day, which led to remission of catatonia in 3 days (BFCRS score=0). On remission of catatonia, he started to show goal-directed hyperactivity and talkativeness with thought content revealing grandiosity, which gradually increased for the next few days. During this time, his MSE revealed increased speech output with prolixity, increased psychomotor activity, delusion of grandiosity and no perceptual abnormalities (Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score=26). Further clarification of the past two catatonia episodes revealed that in each episode, he would first present with the similar type of symptoms such as mutism, posturing and negativism (and stupor as an additional symptom in the first episode), which would be the initial presentation and have an abrupt onset with a dramatic response to treatments prescribed by a psychiatrist that would ultimately manifest in a similar mental state similar to the index episode (ie, mania). However, in none of these episodes, he continued with the psychiatrist’s advice. Considering the past episodes and the current index presentation, he received a provisional diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, current episode mania with psychosis according to ICD-10, and he was started on tablet sodium valproate 1 g/day, quetiapine 100 mg/day and lorazepam 2 mg/day, with which he showed significant improvement in the next 3 weeks (YMRS score=11). He was discharged on this regimen and on a subsequent follow-up after a month, he was found to maintain well."
"A healthy 25-year-old woman, with no history of contact lens wear, presented with several hours of pain, injection and tearing in the right eye. The patient reported accidental exposure to coral reef fluid (Zoanthids-Green Bay Packers, Fig. ) when cleaning her aquarium. She immediately irrigated the eye and continued using artificial tears every 3–4 h.\nOn examination, before instillation of topical anesthetic, testing of the pH with a Hydrion (Micro Essential Laboratory Inc., Brooklyn, NY, USA) pH strip in both upper and lower fornices revealed a normal pH of 7.0. The pH strip was applied into each fornix for 1 s, then instantly compared the resulting color with the matching pH color chart. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes with normal intraocular pressures. She had upper greater-than-lower lid edema with minimal erythema and no induration. In addition, there was a significant inferior bulbar conjunctival epithelial defect with associated injection, subtle blanching of conjunctival vessels, chemosis, and patchy subconjunctival hemorrhage (Fig. ); there was no corneal epithelial defect (Fig. ). Conjunctival swabs were sent for bacterial culture and gram stain. She was started on topical moxifloxacin 0.5% and prednisolone acetate 1.0% 4× daily as well as preservative-free artificial tears every 2 h. The lid edema worsened over the next 24 h, but she remained afebrile with no changes on ocular exam indicating a low likelihood of a secondary bacterial cellulitis.\nOn follow up 3 days later, her symptoms had significantly improved; similarly, her exam revealed resolution of the lid edema as well as resolution of the conjunctival injection and chemosis. Gram stain and culture of the conjunctiva showed no neutrophils or organisms. At 2-week follow-up, her symptoms had resolved. Moxifloxacin was stopped and she was subsequently tapered off the prednisolone over a 4-week period by reducing 1 drop each week."
"Case 1 was a 25-year-old woman receiving oral contraceptives for treating dysmenorrhea. The patient was injured in a motorcycle accident and was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain. Her vital signs were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale score, 15; arterial blood pressure, 106/82 mmHg; heart rate, 88 b.p.m.; and oxygen saturation, 97%. The initial blood test results were as follows: hemoglobin level, 16.7 g/dL; platelet count, 221,000/mm3; prothrombin time, 11.7 s; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 21.4 s; aspartate transaminase level, 398 IU/L; and alanine transaminase level, 349 IU/L. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) findings revealed hepatic contusion of the sixth segment based on Couinaud’s classification, and classified as grade 1 according to the AAST classification. No other traumas were detected. The patient was treated conservatively and started walking the day after the injury to prevent thrombosis. Anticoagulants were not provided because of concerns regarding bleeding complications after trauma. During hospitalization, the patient was followed-up with coagulation tests, which showed an upward trend. The contrast-enhanced CT findings at 1 week after the injury revealed thrombus formation with a maximum diameter of 0.6 cm and a length of 0.2 cm (Fig. ). During this time, the blood coagulation factor was on the rise. Unfractionated heparin treatment was initiated, and APTT was controlled at 50–60 s. At 2 weeks after the accident, the contrast-enhanced CT findings showed that the thrombus had shrunk, and the patient was discharged after replacing the anticoagulant with oral medication."
"A 25-year-old female had recurrent high spikes of fever along with moderate joint pain involving bilateral wrists, elbows, knees, and small joints of hands along with generalized weakness for last 3 months. She was not responsive to antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs. She had splenomegaly but no hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or respiratory complaint. Her investigations revealed anemia (Hemoglobin-9 g/dL), raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 mm, total leucocyte count of 14,060 cells/mm3 (mild leukocytosis), with a differential count comprising 73% of neutrophils, and platelets count of 2.7 lac/mm3. Her serology was negative for rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Peripheral smear revealed RBCs with predominantly microcytic hypochromic appearance along with few target cells and polychromatophils. To look for a cause for anemia and splenomegaly, bone marrow aspirate was done which revealed a mild increase in megakaryocytes with focal clustering and occasional hemophagocytosis. Iron stain from the bone marrow aspirate slides revealed increased iron stores (4+) [Figure -].\nAfter 3 months of onset of symptoms, a dermatology consultation was taken for a persistent itchy rash over trunk. There were dusky erythematous, scaly, barely elevated plaques over back, abdomen, and arms. At the periphery of the plaques, linear lesions were seen giving flagellate appearance []. Considering the typical flagellate rash and associated systemic complaints, the possibility of connective tissue disease, AOSD was considered.\nSkin punch biopsy was taken from the linear rash over back. Histopathological examination showed epidermis with orthokeratosis, mounds of parakeratosis, fibrin plugging, dyskeratotic keratinocytes in stratum spinosum, basal vacuolar degeneration, and focal lymphocytic exocytosis. The underlying papillary dermis showed moderate perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltrate comprising lymphocytes, neutrophils, and nuclear debris along with pigment incontinence. Colloidal iron stain for mucin was weakly positive [Figure -]. The features were compatible with cutaneous manifestations of AOSD described in recent literature.\nFollowing which she was advised for serum ferritin which was raised 15,504 ng/mL (normal: 30–400 ng/mL). Overall, it fulfilled the Yamaguchi's criteria of ASOD [].[] She was then treated with 0.5 mg/kg prednisolone and 10 mg methotrexate for 1 month and is improving on follow-up with disappearance of fever, subsidence of cutaneous lesions [], and significant decrease in joint pain."
"The patient, female, 25 years old, Han nationality, from Jiaxing City, 0-0-2-0, was admitted to the hospital for “menopause for 28 weeks + 5 days, dizziness with nausea and vomiting 2 days.” The patient woke up from a nap the day before admission and developed dizziness, no optical rotation, no tinnitus, vomiting of stomach contents >10 times, accompanied by upper abdominal discomfort, no diarrhea and melena. The initial diagnosis in the emergency department was “dizziness to be investigated, >6 months of pregnancy.”\nFive hours after admission, the patient had sudden convulsions, urinary incontinence, and loss of consciousness. Physical examination showed coma, blood oxygen saturation 97%, blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg, breath 18 times/min, fetal heart rate 130 bpm, right pupil 6 mm, the disappearance of light reflection, left pupil 5 mm, weak light reflection, and unable to cooperate with muscle strength. The muscle tone of the extremities increased, and the Glasgow score was 5 points. According to symptoms and physical signs, physicians consider cerebral hemorrhage, brain herniation, and secondary epilepsy and prescribe sedation and spasmolysis to reduce intracranial pressure. Emergency head computed tomography (CT) showed (Fig. ): (1) right occipital lobe cerebral hemorrhage and break into the ventricular system, accompanied by brain herniation, need to consider the possibility of hemorrhagic cerebral infarction caused by venous sinus thrombosis; (2) a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhageFig. . Admission diagnoses were as follows: (1) cerebral hemorrhage (right occipital lobe and cerebral artery malformation), (2) cerebral hernia, (3) secondary epilepsy, and (4) pregnancy status (28 weeks + 5 days of pregnancy)."
"A 25-year-old Pakistani man presented to the hospital with a 3-d history of subjective fevers, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nWithin a month, the patient experienced several days of diarrhea. His symptoms worsened over the last 3 d and presented to the hospital with subjective fevers, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nThe patient had no significant medical or surgical history, and he did not take any regular medications.\nThe patient did not have a history of smoking or drinking.\nOn presentation to the Emergency Department, the physical examination revealed a body temperature of 39.7 °C, blood pressure of 105/85 mmHg, and pulse of 108 beats per minute (slight tachycardia). Right lower abdominal pain with mild whole abdominal tenderness was found on abdominal palpation. No rashes were found.\nInitial laboratory tests showed a normal white blood cell (WBC) level at 7.45 × 109/L with neutrophils at 6.5 × 109/L, zero eosinophils, and increased procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and C-recreative protein.\nAbdominal computerized tomography (CT) was performed, which revealed a fatty liver and a thickened intestinal wall of the ileocecal junction with multiple enlarged lymph nodes nearby, indicating appendicitis (Figure )."
"A 25-year-old non-smoking African woman with no history of previous chest troubles presented with acute-onset chest pain and shortness of breath. Chest radiography gave the impression of loculated pneumothorax. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest verified the presence of right-side pneumothorax, with a large bulla in the right lower lobe () and multiple variably-sized bullae involving most of the outer surface of the upper lobe. A chest drain was inserted and on a later date the patient underwent surgical resection of the lower lobe bulla () and electrocautery ablation of the upper lobe bullae, in addition to mechanical pleural abrasions. We started with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and then converted to small muscle-sparing lateral thoracotomy with the assistance of a thoracoscopic camera due to marked adhesions of the upper lobe. At her last visit, she was doing well 1 year after surgery."
"Chest pain, nausea and vomiting × 3 d.\nA 25-year-old male patient with no prior medical history presented to the emergency department with chest pain, nausea and vomiting × 3 d. He described sharp, intermittent chest pain that is sub sternal, radiating to the back and left arm for last 3 d. His pain is worse upon leaning forward and worse with deep inspiration. He also had multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting with an episode of coffee-ground emesis. Patient reported long-term abuse of hydrocarbon containing inhalant (PC keyboard dust off) for the last 1 year. He used to huff 2 cans of dust off at the same time to achieve a hallucinogenic effect along with marijuana use. One week prior to admission, he reported increased use (10 cans/d).\nHistory of intracranial aneurysm rupture in father.\nThe patient’s heart rate was 112 bpm, respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 114/73 mmHg and oxygen saturation on room air was 99%.

Initial electrocardiography (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with diffuse inferolateral ST elevation, concerning for acute myopericarditis (Figure ).\nEchocardiogram showed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) of 40% to 45% with severe aortic root dilation (5.0 cm) and trivial pericardial effusion. Given patient’s elevated troponins, cardiac catheterization was performed. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease (Figure ). Working diagnosis of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) was established and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed to evaluate the etiology further.\nCMR showed borderline LV function with edema in the mid and apical LV suggestive of myocardial inflammation (Figure and ). No delayed enhancement was seen in the myocardium or in the pericardium (Figure and ). There was no evidence of pericardial effusion."
"A 25-year-old female presented to our department after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She had no prior history of seizures. The brain MRI scans showed a strongly enhancing cortical mass about 3×2×2 cm in size with peri-lesional edema and with no definite dural tail sign (). The initial radiological diagnoses were meningioma or hemangiopericytoma. Although it was a small tumor, since it was causing seizures, we decided to perform total surgical resection as the primary treatment.\nA right fronto-parietal craniotomy was performed, and we achieved gross total removal of the tumor. Contrary to our expectation, there was no adhesion between the dura-mater and the tumor. The tumor was well-demarcated, marginated from right fronto-parietal cortex, and encapsulated. It was highly vascularized, and friable solid mass. The tumor had minimal adhesions attaching to the arachnoid membrane, but no invasion of the brain parenchyma was seen (). The tumor was friable; therefore, it was thoroughly aspirated with a cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator. Gross total removal without any injury of the peri-lesional area was achieved. After surgery, the patient had no further seizures. Postoperative MRI scans showed no evidence of a residual mass.\nIn histological study, we found that the tumor had a clear cell feature which requires some differentiation such as clear cell EPN, clear cell meningioma or oligodendroglioma. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed a sheet of uniform cells with round nuclei, finely dispersed chromatin, clear cytoplasm, discrete cytoplasmic borders, rare mitosis, no necrosis (). Immunohistochemically, the epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) was positive with a dot-like pattern (), GFAP and Olig2 were focal positive (), and L1CAM was strongly positive (). Analysis of 1p/19q codeletion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed no deletion with polysomy. Ki-67 labeling index was 14.3%, S-100 was positive, vimentin was positive, and IDH1 gene mutation was not detected. Histological and immunohistochemical study allowed the tumor to be diagnosed as EPN with C11orf95-RELA-fusion.\nMRI scans that were performed at the time of 10 months after tumor removal operation did not show any significant recurrence and the peri-lesional edema that was seen in preoperative MRI scans was no longer visible. And the patient maintained the seizure free state."
"Case 2 was a 25-year-old female diagnosed in January 2020 with B-ALL in the standard risk group. White blood count at diagnosis was 18.93 × 109/L. CR was achieved after chemotherapy with idarubicin, vincristine, pegaspargase and prednisone. After consolidation chemotherapy with the hyper-CVAD regimen, hematologic relapse was detected in June 2020. BM morphology showed that 60% of blasts were positive for CD13, CD19, CD22, CD33, CD34, CD38, cCD79a, and HLA-DR and negative for CD20 (). A normal karyotype was detected. The results of multiplex PCR were negative. The EP300-ZNF384 fusion gene was also detected with RNA sequencing, with fusion of exon 6 of EP300 to exon 3 of ZNF384 (). The NGS results showed KRAS Glu63_Ala66delinAspProThr and KMD6A Leu231fs mutations. After reinduction chemotherapy (idarubicin 10 mg on day 1, vincristine 4 mg on day 1, and dexamethasone 14 mg on days 1–7), the blasts remained at 20.5%. Due to the weak expression of CD20 (1.13%) and the high expression of CD19 (100%) and CD22 (67.3%), she was enrolled in the same clinical trial and received the same chemotherapy 5, 4 and 3 days before the first infusion of CAR T-cells, which was followed by three infusions administered for the next 3 days. The effective anti-CD19/CD22 CAR T-cells totaled 2 × 107/kg (). She suffered grade 2 CRS and presented with fever and hypotension, which was relieved by symptomatic treatments and low-dose norepinephrine (). No symptoms of ICANS were observed. Amplification of CAR T-cell as detected by qPCR peaked at day 10 and dropped detectable before HSCT (). At 28 days post CAR T-cell therapy, BM evaluation showed <1 × 10−4 of blasts by flow cytometry and negative EP300-ZNF384 with qPCR, which demonstrated that MRD-negative CR was achieved (). In addition, results for the EP300-ZNF384 fusion and KRAS and KMD6A mutations all became negative. She underwent a haploidentical allo-HSCT with her sister as donor at a month post CAR T-cell therapy. No signs of GVHD were observed, and she remained in MRD-negative CR for 13 months after CAR-T therapy."
"A 25-year-old woman, homemaker, came to outpatient department (OPD) with complaints of eating mud for 2 years, increased for the past 1 month, decreased appetite for 6 months, and occasional apprehension. The patient was apparently asymptomatic around 2 years back when she started eating mud. At first, she had around 2–3 pinches. She continued to have pinches for around 1 year when she felt a need to increase the amount of mud she used to have daily. Thereafter, the amount of mud increased to 20–40 g/day. She preferred dry mud. She stated that the mud eating was preceded by an irresistible urge and simply that she enjoyed having mud. She did, however, note that once she began eating mud, she would have the need to eat more. Since the past month, the urge to have mud had increased to such an extent she started buying mud from the market to eat. She used to have around 100 g of mud daily. Whenever she tried to avoid eating mud, she would feel the need to eat something hard and could not control the urge to have mud and at times used to have apprehension. To control the apprehension, she used to eat mud. On enquiring, she said that she knows eating mud was not a right thing, but her urge was so strong that she was unable to stop herself from eating mud that made her distressed. She is also experiencing decreased appetite for the past 6 months. Earlier, she used to eat three meals in a day with a mid-day snacks. In each meal, she used to have two chapattis with a bowl of rice and a bowl of vegetable and pulses. For around 6 months, she has started missing her mid-day snacks and only eats one chapatti with a bowl of pulses. On asking by spouse and parents-in-law, she said that she does not feel like eating food. No significant past and family history was reported. She presented as a well-orientated, cleanly dressed lady with normal speech and appropriate replies. Her mood was generally warm and friendly. She had no abnormality of thoughts or perceptions and scored 30/30 on a Mini Mental State Examination. She was prescribed fluoxetine that was gradually increased to 40 mg along with multiple sessions of psychotherapy and showed a significant improvement in her condition."
"A 25-year-old male, educated till 10th class, working as a welder, presented with irritability, muttering, and gesturing to self, suspiciousness toward neighbor that they will harm him for 10 years. He used to have irrelevant talks and use to talk to self only, making some gestures. His sleep and appetite are also decreased. On MSE, delusion of persecution, with 2nd and 3rd person auditory hallucinations were present. IQ was 46. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia with moderate ID with Type 2 diabetes. He was treated on these medications: tablet trifluoperazine 10 mg BD, tablet trihexyphenidyl 2 mg B.D, tablet sodium valproate 500 mg BD, and tablet metformin 500 mg b.d and eventually on injection haloperidol 50 mg L.A given monthly. He showed significant improvement and was continued on these medications."
"A 25-year-old female, studying M.A, was brought to the Psychiatric Outpatient Department (OPD) with a history of irritability, becoming aggressive on trivial issues, and breaking things of 1-year duration. Onset of symptoms followed a breakup. The patient began dating a boy whom she met at her sister's wedding. They grew fond of each other and would talk or text most of the time as they were living in separate cities. During their courtship, they met once and established a physical relationship. After this incident, she went home and told her parents that she wants to marry that person. Her parents were totally opposed to this. Hence, by mutual consent, they called off the relationship. After the separation, she stopped taking interest in studies and did not appear for her examination. Whenever she became upset, she used to say that no one loves her or cares for her, all were her enemies. Following a heated argument with her mother, she went to her room and attempted suicide by cutting her wrists. After admission to the hospital, she disclosed about her sexual abuse. The patient is fourth among five siblings. She has four sisters and one brother. From childhood to adolescence, her brother used to sexually abuse her; initially, he pursued her by doing role-plays and later manipulated her into doing inappropriate things. The patient had told everything to her mother, but her mother did not take any step against this. The patient still has an unpleasant relation with her mother and brother. All these childhood experiences left adverse effects on her mind and personality. She does not feel comfortable with males, whether they are her family members or outsiders. She feels comfortable with her female friends only. Serial mental status examination (MSE) showed that she had persistent feeling of guilt, hopelessness, ruminations about past instances, and suicidal ideas. With a diagnosis of dysthymic disorder, she was treated with antidepressants and psychotherapy with a gradual response."
"A 25-year-old female, educated up to 10th std, unmarried, 22 weeks gravida came to OPD with complaints of gradually progressive low mood, decreased interest in daily activities, feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, sleep disturbance, and loss of appetite over the span of 4 years with increased intensity for the past 6 months. The patient reported that when she was 17 years old, her stepfather tried to molest her sexually. She was able to save herself by running out of the house. Later, her father threatened her not to tell anyone about the incident with which she got frightened. A month later, her stepfather again tried to force her to engage in sexual activity which she resisted. She complained to her mother when she returned from work, but her mother did not believe her and thought that she was lying. After a month, due to frequent quarrels in the family, she started feeling low. The symptoms increased to such an extent that she had to leave her job. Then by mutual decision, her parents asked her to live separately. The patient shifted with one of her friends who was residing in a rented flat. She found another job where she met a man. They frequently met each other and fell in love with each other. During this period, the patient started feeling well and regained hope of a better and happy life in future. After around 1 year of relationship, she became pregnant. On being informed of this, her boyfriend refused to have anything to do with the child. He even left the job and stopped all communication with her. After this, the patient decided that she will give birth to the child without any support and look after her child on her own. Gradually she started having low mood, began taking frequent leave from job, and used to sit alone at home and do nothing. She had disturbed sleep and poor appetite. She felt hopeless about her future and inability to support her child. On MSE, the patient appeared sad with teary eyes. Talk was relevant and coherent. The mood was depressed; there was no suicidal ideation. She was diagnosed with a case of recurrent depressive disorder. She responded satisfactorily to pharmacological treatment and cognitive behavior therapy and delivered a healthy male child."
"This 25-year-old unmarried female, graduate, unemployed, belonging to middle socioeconomic group, reported to psychiatry OPD with complaints of persistent abdominal pain despite multiple evaluations and treatment with no significant relief for 4 years. She also complained of lethargy, generalized weakness, low mood, irritability, fearfulness, decreased interaction, lack of interest in academics and household activities with consistent decline in academic performance, sleep disturbances, and reduced appetite with loss of weight for the past 3 years. History revealed that when she was 11 years of age, the family members sent her out to buy groceries from the nearby shop. On the way, she met a stranger who promised to buy her lots of chocolates and started a conversation with her and took her inside a shed. There, he started touching her private parts. She was very scared and tried to evade and as soon as she saw people passing by she started crying and shouting for help following which he left threatening her that he would harm her family members and friends if she discusses about this with anyone. She came back home traumatized by the incident and did not share the incident with anyone out of fear. On MSE, she appeared sad with teary eyes, spoke in a low tone, and mood was depressed. Her thoughts were logical, coherent, and relevant with no suicidal ideation but with somatic preoccupation. She was diagnosed with moderate depressive episode with somatic symptoms. She was treated with antidepressants, anxiolytics, and psychotherapy and showed gradual improvement in her symptoms on follow-up."
"25-year-old male patient presented with progressive symmetrical distal lower and upper limb weakness in August 2015, one month following yellow fever vaccination. Distal power (abductor pollicis brevis, first dorsal interossei, abductor digiti minimi and wrist extensors) was 4/5 on MRC grading with wasting and areflexia. There was prominent sensory ataxia and bilateral fingers tremor. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) protein was elevated (900 mg/dL) with zero cell count. Nerve conduction study (NCS) showed diffuse symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy of demyelinating range, fulfilling definite European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) criteria for CIDP. Treatment with regular high dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) treatment over the next 18 months in addition to corticosteroid maintenance therapy proved unhelpful. Upon referral to our centre, he had subtle right relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) but otherwise normal visual acuity and colour vision. Other cranial nerves were normal. Brain and whole spine MRI were normal. Serum IgG 4 against NF 155 was positive with titre 1:24 300. Visual-evoked potentials (VEP) showed prolonged P100 latencies suggestive of bilateral optic nerve demyelination (right 124.0 ms, left 132.0 ms) (). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed normal retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) at all quadrants (average thickness right 101 μm and left 96 μm). Following that, he received IV rituximab maintenance with stabilisation of disease."
"The case report is describing a 25 years old housekeeper married female that complained about functional inflammatory issues for 2 years with priority in the right side and morning contraction for more than 1 hour. It was recognized as AS (Ankylosing spondylitis) primarily and treatment by 150 mg of indomethacin daily was applied which no clinical response was observed for it. Fever, night sweating and weight loss were not occurred as well. During examinations there was not any particular point but tenderness in the right sacroiliac ().\nDuring the checkups it was demonstrated sacroiliac joint is normal. However lytic and sclerotic lesions in right iliac and density changing of L5 vertebra and humerus head have been revealed by CT scan. It has to be mentioned that all of clinical experiments were considered as normal including CBC, ESR, LDH and LFT. Primary diagnosis was Paget’s and the then open biopsy was taken from the iliac bone. The morphological results revealed of diffuse large B cell lymphoma."
"A 25-year-old female presented with progressive swelling at the right external auditory meatus and bleeding from the mass when a crust was removed from its surface. Examination revealed a round ulcerated, skin-covered mass located on the posterior-superior wall of the entrance of the EAC, which partially obstructed the canal (). The medial EAC, eardrum and an audiogram were normal. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed immensely enhanced round mass with no invasion of adjacent structures and normal middle ear cavity (). These findings strongly suggested that the tumor originated from vascular tissue. Four-vessel angiography showed that it was fed by the posterior auricular artery, which was embolized successfully (). Under general anesthesia, the tumor was excised under an operating microscope; there were no adhesions to the surrounding tissues. The defect in the EAC was covered with a full-thickness retroauricular skin graft. The surgical specimen measured 2.0×1.8×1.5 cm with attached skin (1.8×1.0 cm). On cut section, the tumor was a well-demarcated, non-encapsulated, solid, gray-white nodule in the dermis (). There was no necrosis or hemorrhage. Histologically, the mass comprised predominantly spindle cells of moderate cellularity in a patternless architecture of hypo- and hypercellular areas separated by thick, hyalinized collagen with occasional vascular clefts () with focal myxoid stroma. The tumor cells had minimal nuclear pleomorphism (). Roughly two mitotic figures were found per ten high-power fields, but no atypical mitotic figures were identified. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells showed a positive reaction for CD34, and partially positive for bcl2 () (×200) and CD99 () (×200). () But they did show a negative reaction for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, S-100 protein, smooth muscle actin, CD68 and CD31. The Ki-67 proliferative index was 2%. Based on these findings, it was diagnosed as a SFT."
"A 25-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 0) was referred to our clinic for a routine USG during the 29th week of gestation. Her past medical history was uneventful; in particular, there was no evidence of hypertension. The USG examination revealed a hyperechogenic nodule measuring 1.4 cm in diameter, located above the right kidney. Doppler USG was used, and there was no sign of peripheral vascularization to the lesion. The amniotic fluid volume was normal and the fetal development was appropriate for the gestational age. Follow-up USG was performed during the 36th week of gestation. The lesion had doubled in size (3.3 cm in diameter), and the liver had enlarged, showing a heterogeneous texture. Fetal MRI was also performed on the same day. A round mass was identified in the topography of the right adrenal gland with a low signal on T1-weighted sequences and slightly high signal on T2-weighted sequences, measuring 4.2×3.4×4.1 cm, causing a slight inferior displacement of the kidney (). The liver was enlarged and the signal intensity was heterogeneous, predominantly hypointense on T2-weighted sequences. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of congenital adrenal neuroblastoma with liver metastases was suggested.\nCesarean section was performed during the 38th week of gestation. A male infant, weighing 2,890 g, was delivered with Apgar scores of 9 at both 1st and 5th minute. A physical examination of the neonate, performed immediately after delivery, demonstrated abdominal distention and hepatomegaly. At 5 weeks of age, a follow-up MRI was performed. It revealed a poorly defined mass in the right adrenal gland measuring 3.6×3.3×2.2 cm with heterogeneous signal intensity, predominantly hypointense on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences, with heterogeneous contrast enhancement and a central area of cystic degeneration. The liver showed a huge enlargement (extending from the right iliac fosse up to the left hypochondria), lobulated contours, multiple nodular lesions, a low signal on T1-weighted images and high signal on T2-weighted images, and enhancement after gadolinium administration ().\nThe infant had a clinical follow-up with no surgery or drugs because of the abdominal location. At 5 months of age, he was asymptomatic with a normal physical examination. The follow-up MRI showed the right adrenal mass with the same signal characteristics as recorded previously but with an significant decrease in size (2.0×1.1×0.9 cm). The liver showed no focal lesions, presented with normal size, contours, and signal intensity, as well as homogeneous gadolinium enhancement ()."
"Patient 1 is a young woman in her 20s who presented with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of >200 mm Hg, seizure, and right hemiparesis in the setting of thunderclap headache. She reported several weeks of worsening headaches in the setting of marijuana use. MRI showed multiple bilateral infarcts and MRA showed diffuse beading of the intracranial vessels that during angiography responded to intra-arterial injection of verapamil. A lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Following the angiogram, she was started on intravenous magnesium and nimodipine without change in her TCD velocities, which were elevated on presentation; however, velocities decreased when nimodipine was changed to verapamil, and normalized further when the extended-release form was used (see fig. ). Verapamil SR was continued on discharge.\nOutcome: discharged to acute rehabilitation with apraxia of speech and hemiparesis.\nFollow-up mRS: unknown."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with a painless palpable mass in the left upper eyelid accompanied by mild proptosis (fig. ). The mass was mobile, hard, smooth, nontender and well delineated. It increased in size for 6 months, reaching approximately 15 mm in diameter. Computed tomography showed a homogenous isodense ovoid mass with distinct margins without bone invasion in the lacrimal gland fossa (fig. ). T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed a high-intensity mass with various low-intensity areas, encapsulated by a low-intensity 1-mm thick capsule (fig. ). The preoperative diagnosis was lacrimal gland tumor or deep dermoid cyst.\nThe patient underwent tumor excision via upper eyelid crease approach. A smooth, encapsulated mass was identified beneath the swollen lacrimal gland (fig. ). The tumor was not attached to the periosteum and was completely removed. Postoperatively, there was noted improvement of proptosis. At the time of last examination, 6 months after surgery, no evidence of recurrence was observed.\nPostoperative histopathology revealed bipolar oval to spindle-shaped cells in a heavily collagenized stroma, with focal accumulation of macrophages (fig. ). No necrosis was present. Immunohistochemical findings supported the diagnosis of SFT. Tumor cells were positive for the cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34), signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), S-100, B-cell leukemia-2 (BCL-2), CD99 and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), but negative for desmin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and cytokeratin (fig. ). MIB-1 was present in 10% of all cells."
"A 25-year-old male dentist presented with recurrent episodes of intensely pruritic follicular pustules on the scalp from last 3 years. The lesions would start from the vertex and then extend peripherally; each episode was followed by scarring. There was no history of any systemic complaint. General physical examination and systemic examination were noncontributory. Mucosae and nails were not affected. Skin biopsy from the lesions showed neutrophilic infiltrate at the follicular infundibulum with a pathological diagnosis of folliculitis decalvans. After sending baseline hemogram, liver chemistry, and complete lipid profile, the patient was started on isotretinoin 20 mg capsules (patient's weight was 78 kg) daily to be taken with food. In view of a slow response, this dose had been doubled by another dermatologist to 40 mg daily. In addition, the patient was prescribed topical antibacterial washes. The patient responded well to the revised dose of isotretinoin, but 1 month into treatment the patient had to travel a long distance. On reaching his destination, he experienced severe body cramps and a generalized feeling of ill-health. He was flown back home and brought to the hospital. On reception in the hospital, the patient was listless, ill-looking, and febrile. Systemic examination showed the patient had tachycardia. Musculoskeletal examination revealed normal joints; however, there was a weakness of lower limb and girdle muscles. Grover's sign for proximal myopathy was positive. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. There was generalized skin tenderness, but no erythema or peeling except for palmar erythema. Lip cheilitis was seen. Mucosae were normal. No lymphadenopathy was seen. Investigations revealed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. A raised level of creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 317 IU/L and lactate dehydrogenase was seen. Electromyogram (EMG) and muscle ultrasound were consistent with myopathy. Retroviral serology and hepatitis B and C serology were negative. Antinuclear antibody and anti-U1RNP were also negative. Muscle biopsy was not done. A provisional diagnosis of isotretinoin-induced myopathy was made. Isotretinoin was discontinued. The patient responded to bed rest and supportive treatment comprising analgesics in the course of a few weeks. Rechallenge with isotretinoin was avoided for ethical reasons."
"A 25-year-old male patient (V-5) (), former, non-professional, soccer player was born to consanguineous parents. At the age of 10 years, familial history of VHL disease prompted mutational analysis of the VHL gene. He was found to be a VHL carrier (chromosome 3p25.3; c. 256 C>G; p.P86A mutation) without VHL-related manifestations at the time of diagnosis but later developing bilateral retinal capillary hemangioblastomas and multiple pancreatic simple cysts. The patient was hospitalized in 2003, 2006, and 2008 at ages of 12, 15, and 17 years, respectively, for diffuse muscular pain, muscle weakness, and brown-colored urine. Symptoms in all three episodes were triggered by prolonged exercise in addition to acute febrile illness caused by pneumonia (in 2003 and 2006) and gastroenteritis (in 2008) and resolved within a few days with antibiotics therapy. At each hospitalization, neurological examination was normal whereas serum creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and serum and urine myoglobin levels were abnormal (). On the contrary, serum creatinine and potassium were completely normal during () and between the attacks. The recurrent attacks suggested an inherited cause of rhabdomyolysis. Electromyography showed no abnormality whereas quadriceps muscle biopsy showed necrosis of muscle fibers (“ghost fibers”) (-). With suspicion of a CPT2 deficiency, biochemical CPT2 assay showed a marked CPT deficiency (isotope, 43.8 pmol/min/mg [normal value, 452±160 pmol/min/mg]; forward, 137 pmol/min/mg [normal value, 367±110 pmol/min/mg]) along with elevation of serum long-chain acylcarnitines levels (). CPT2 gene sequencing showed the homozygous substitution c.338C>T (p.S113L). Frequent meals with carbohydrate-rich intake before exercise and restriction of long-chain fatty acid intake along with medium chain fatty acid supplementation were recommended to prevent further attacks.\nFamily history was negative regarding manifestations of CPT2 deficiency, whereas mother, brother, maternal aunts, and maternal grandmother of the proband presented VHL manifestations ()."
"A 25-year-old woman complained of severe low back pain associated right sided sciatica for 2 months. She presented with acute ankle and toes weakness with loss of bladder and bowel control prior to admission. Her anal tone was lax with loss of perianal sensation. Power of the extensor hallucis longus (L5) was grade 0 and ankle plantar flexion (S1) was grade 2. Blood investigations were normal. CT and MR scans revealed a large extradural mass located dorsal and extending to the right pedicle of L5 vertebra with vertebra plana of L5 causing significant neural structure compression at L5 level (). MR imaging further revealed a hypointense signal on both T1 and T2-weighted images with contrast enhancement. Transpedicular core needle biopsy of L5 confirmed the diagnosis of GCT. Similar to the previous case, she was started on subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 43, with monthly doses thereafter. She had good neurological recovery with improvement in ODI (). There were no denosumab related adverse reactions."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a 5-year history of a gradually progressive weakness of both the lower limbs with associated pain and difficulty in walking for 1 month. Neurological examination disclosed decreased motor power in both the lower limbs.\nMRI of the brain was normal. MRI of the dorsolumbar spine was performed on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner. Multiplanar conventional T1WI and T2WI were acquired. A large, oval-shaped cystic lesion was seen involving the D12 to L2 vertebral level intraspinally intradural extramedullary indenting the spinal cord, homogeneously hypointense on T1WI [Figure and ]. Arachnoid cyst, epidermoid cyst, and cystic meningioma were considered in the differential diagnosis.\nThe patient underwent a laminectomy from T12 to L2. The dura was tense at L1. On opening the dura, a 30 mm long, smooth spinal cord enlargement was seen. A midline myelotomy was performed revealing a well-circumscribed white cystic lesion. The cyst was dissected free from the surrounding spinal cord parenchyma without much difficulty and was removed totally [].\nHistopathology showed the typical parasitic cyst with multiple layers [Figure and ] along with the sucker of the larval form. This case too was reported as spinal cysticercosis.\nPostoperatively, the patient was treated with albendazole. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged. Follow-up (1 year) is being done showing a recovery in the motor power of her lower limbs."
"A 25-year-old male already a diagnosed with MEN 2b syndrome was referred to the ophthalmology department by the internists for complaints of thickening of both upper lids. A review of his medical records revealed that the patient had bilateral pheochromocytoma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland with metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes, and multiple mucosal neuromas. A detailed slit lamp biomicroscopic examination was performed for both eyes followed by bilateral IVCM using the Heidelberg retinal tomograph 3 with Rostock cornea module."
"A 25-year-old male with a previous episode of Stevens–Johnson syndrome with bilateral corneal cicatrization presented complaining of decreasing vision in his (better) left eye. His visual acuity in the right eye (oculus dexter) was hand motion (HM) [], and in his left eye (oculus sinister) HM with pinhole improvement to 20/300. In this eye, the patient had four failed corneal grafts (including tectonic penetrating keratoplasty, amniotic membrane transplant, and bandage contact lens [BCL]) and trabeculectomy for secondary glaucoma 7 months previously []. The patient underwent surgery for Type 1 Boston K-Pro in his left eye, with improvement of vision to 20/70.\nThe patient suffered from severe dry eye postoperatively, which was managed with lubricants, topical corticosteroids but no BCL, or topical antibiotic prophylaxis. Sixteen months after the K-Pro surgery, the patient presented with decreased vision to HM and microbial keratitis of the graft around the K-Pro with purulent discharge []. The palpebral conjunctiva was keratinized with corneal neovascularization and extremely chemotic bulbar conjunctiva. He was placed on fortified topical moxifloxacin hourly, lubrication, and systemic fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The eye was mildly hypotonous and B-scan ultrasound showed possible choroidal detachment. Corneal scrapings were nonrevealing. Repeat B-scan in 3 days showed resolved choroidals but increased debris in the vitreous cavity and thickened retinochoroidal layer. For this and increasing ocular pain, intravitreal tap and injections of vancomycin and ceftazidime were performed. Two days after the procedure, the vision was the same with decreased ocular pain. The vitreous culture revealed β-hemolytic S. agalactiae; fungal cultures were negative. Repeat B-scan 3 days later demonstrated decreased vitreous opacity, and the ocular examination showed improved chemosis; the patient felt more comfortable and was pain free. He continued with topical antibiotics and was discharged in a week. On follow-up visit 2 weeks later, the patient was pain free, vision improved to 20/200, and anterior segment was quiet []. His visual acuity improved to 20/70, ocular findings have been stable for 9 months, and the patient continues to be monitored."
"A 25-year-old male patient with noncontributory medical history reported with the complaint of pain in right upper back teeth since few days. History revealed that he had intermittent pain for the last 6 months which increased in intensity and duration for the last 3–4 days. The pain kept him awake the whole night. Intraoral examination revealed a deep carious lesion in tooth 16. The tooth was tender on percussion and gave delayed response to electric pulp testing (Parkell Electronics Division, Farmingdale, NY, USA). The tooth showed intensified pain on thermal test with heated GP and dry ice (R C Ice; Prime Dental Products, India).\nPreoperative periapical radiograph [] revealed a three-rooted maxillary first molar with deep occlusal caries extending to the pulp chamber. The radiograph did not reveal unusual morphology associated with any of the three roots. A diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with symptomatic apical periodontitis was made, and nonsurgical endodontic therapy was suggested to the patient.\nConsent was taken from the patient. The tooth was anesthetized with 1.8 ml of 2% lignocaine containing 1:200,000 adrenaline, and rubber dam was applied. An endodontic access was established using Endo Access Bur and Endo Z Bur. DG-16 endodontic explorer and DOM were used to locate the canal orifices, and four orifices were appreciated. The access cavity was refined using ultrasonic tips. After coronal flaring of canals with Ni-Ti ProTaper Universal Instruments, the WL was established using electronic apex locater (Raypex 5) and confirmed by periapical radiograph []. Two canals were found in palatal root and single canal each in MB and DB root []. After removing the pulp tissue, temporary restoration with IRM was given.\nOn the second appointment, the patient was asymptomatic. Temporary restoration was removed and further cleaning and shaping was performed with Ni-Ti ProTaper instruments in crown down manner under copious irrigation with 3% sodium hypochlorite and 17% EDTA. A master cone radiograph was taken with gutta Percha inserted into the canals up to the WL to ensure adequate preparation of the canals []. Obturation was done with GP and AH Plus resin sealer using single-cone obturation technique, and the tooth was permanently restored []. The patient was asymptomatic at 1-month follow-up."
"Patient A was a 25-year-old woman with mild ID (Full Intelligence Quotient [FIQ] =53). She had performed poorly in school from junior high school onwards and occasionally taken organic solvent. She started intermittently using MA at 15 years of age after graduating from junior high school. She began experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations at 19 years of age; at the age of 21 years, treatment began for her at a local clinic with atypical antipsychotics including aripiprazole (30 mg/day), olanzapine (10 mg/day), and paliperidone (6 mg/day) (drugs were administered non-concurrently). Although she continued to take the medicines, adverse effects such as drowsiness, weight gain, and amenorrhea led her to keep complaining about the prescriptions. Eventually, every treatment failed to improve her symptoms despite good compliance to the treatment. The auditory hallucinations had a significant negative impact on her activities of daily living and social relationships, contributing to self-mutilation (cutting herself repeatedly) and an incident in which she ran away from home. She was referred to our hospital at 24 years of age.\nExaminations including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated no brain abnormalities in Patient A. She was diagnosed with MAP in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5). Symptoms of MAP were assessed using the Japanese version of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), in which higher scores indicate greater severity according to a 7-point Likert scale. Subscale scores were calculated using small sets of variables based on the three domains of the PANSS: positive, negative, and general psychopathological symptoms. Patient A obtained a PANSS score of 156. She did not have schizophrenia or any other psychiatric disorders, and was thus prescribed 8 mg of blonanserin, with the expectation that it would elicit the fewest adverse effects. Every 3 days, the dose was increased by 4 mg until it reached 20 mg/day. Over the course of 2 weeks, the patient showed improvements with respect to her positive symptoms, and she obtained a PANSS score of 87. However, when the blonanserin dose was increased to 20 mg/day, patient A developed akathisia and was thus prescribed clonazepam. Within several days, the symptoms of akathisia had nearly disappeared. Therefore, the dosage of blonanserin was increased to 24 mg/day. After 1 month with a daily blonanserin dosage of 24 mg/day with clonazepam, Patient A reported that her auditory hallucinations had nearly disappeared, with few adverse effects (PANSS score of 62). Patient A was able to continue taking blonanserin and clonazepam for at least 18 months (PANSS score of 39)."
"A 25-year-old Japanese man presented with hematemesis from a Dieulafoy’s lesion on the lesser curvature of the gastric body, accompanied by nausea, epigastric discomfort and severe epigastralgia. Gastric endoscopy showed multiple map-like ulcerative lesions and scars on the greater curvature of the body to fornix and atrophic gastritis with H. pylori infection (Figure and B), while magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging showed no specific abnormal microsurface pattern and a microvascular pattern suggestive of a gastric cancerous lesion (Figure ). Endoscopic ultrasonography showed an irregular thickness of the second layer of the gastric wall without evidence of invasion into the third layer (Figure ). Histopathological findings of biopsy specimens from the ulcer edge revealed multiple noncaseating granulomatous lesions in the mucosal layer of the gastric wall (Figure and B). In addition, there were no significant or specific histopathological findings suggestive of Crohn’s disease, Whipple’s disease, reaction to malignancy or foreign body, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis or syphilis. Chest computed tomography showed an infiltrative shadow and a pulmonary nodule, but no involvement of the heart, skin, eyes or nervous system. Despite administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and H. pylori eradication therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin, his gastrointestinal symptoms and endoscopic findings did not improve in the three to six months after the initiation of therapy.\nGastric sarcoidosis was diagnosed based on the above results and a prednisolone was started orally at 30 mg per day. His gastrointestinal symptoms improved within 7 d. After improvement of symptoms, the dose of the prednisolone was gradually tapered by 5 mg every fortnight. However, similar symptoms recurred when the dose reached 10 mg, which was suggestive of corticosteroid-dependent gastric sarcoidosis. As an additional treatment, oral azathioprine at 50 mg was given, and alleviation of symptoms was achieved with 30 mg of prednisolone and 50 mg of azathioprine. Four weeks after combined treatment, endoscopy revealed healing ulcers (Figure and 3B) and histopathologically, granuloma and infiltration of inflammatory cells were absent in the gastric mucosal tissue (Figure and D). Although the prednisolone was gradually tapered, he has had no return of abdominal symptoms."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our outpatient clinic with complaints of epigastric pain and swelling. The patient's past medical history and physical examination were non-specific. The findings of routine laboratory tests were all normal. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy did not reveal any abnormality. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) which demonstrated a well-defined cystic lesion measuring 4 cm × 5 cm attached to the posterior wall of the greater curvature of the stomach. The patient underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT), which revealed a 40 mm × 46 mm × 46 mm well-marginated cystic lesion suspected to be GIST. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed for accurate characterisation, showed a 4 cm × 4.5 cm cystic lesion, with heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images, located in the posterior wall of the stomach []. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were both normal. Pre-operative differential diagnosis including GIST was made according to radiological findings. The patient was placed in a supine position. A 10-mm 30° angle camera port was inserted at the umbilicus, one 5-mm port was placed at the right costal margin and done 10-mm were placed at the left costal margin in the midclavicular line for insertion of a harmonic scalpel (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) instrument. By dividing the gastrocolic ligament, the cyst was visualised from lower margin primarily and after carefully dissected from its dorsal attachments. The gastrosplenic ligament and short gastric vessels were dissected and the greater curvature mobilised. Finally, the whole greater curvature was mobilised, the cyst and the stomach wall was transected using linear endoscopic stapler (Echelon Flex™ 60mm; Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) []. The post-operative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged on the fifth post-operative day. Histopathological examination demonstrated a benign cystic lesion covered by respiratory epithelium transitioning focally into gastric mucosa with inflammation and microfoci of haemorrhages and intact smooth muscle layer, suggesting duplication cysts []."
"A 25-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 1, living 1, abortion 2, presented to us at 34 weeks of gestation with antepartum hemorrhage. The patient had symptoms of chest pain and palpitations of a week's duration. Her past pregnancies were uneventful. On examination, pulse was 112/min and blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg. Respiratory system showed bilaterally equal, normal vesicular breath sounds with no rhonchus or crepitations. Cardiovascular system showed loud S3 and no added sounds and murmur. Obstetric scan showed a single live intrauterine gestation without any evidence of placenta previa/abruption. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed biatrial enlargement and partial right bundle branch block pattern. Echocardiography showed dilated left and right atria, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, normal left ventricle systolic function, ejection fraction 60%, pulmonary artery hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure-45 mmHg) with small pericardial effusion []. Doppler showed increased early diastolic filling (E) to atrial filling (A) (E/A) ratio (2.4) of the mitral inflow signal, mitral flow (E-0.85, A-0.35), and pulmonary flow (0.90 m/s) []. In light of these results, the possibility of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) was considered. A detailed family history revealed that her brother was diagnosed to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Genetic counseling of the family was done and genetic testing was advised, but the patient declined testing. Several biochemical tests were done to rule out causes for RCM. Rectal biopsy of the patient showed no deposits of amyloidosis. Absolute eosinophil count was found to be normal (380 cells/cc). Connective tissue disorders were ruled out (antinuclear antibody and antiphospholipid antibody were negative). Metabolic disorders were ruled out by serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (112.8 U/L) and serum lactate (1.4 mmol/L) which were found to be normal. She went into spontaneous labor 10 days later, and she had a preterm vaginal delivery of a live female baby weighing 2 kg. The patient is on diuretics and she continues to be on regular clinical follow-up."
"A 25-year-old male was admitted with a painful swelling of the left lower limb for 15 days duration. He also complained of fever and productive cough for the past 2 months. Previously, he had received antitubercular therapy (ATT) 3 years back and responded. General physical examination revealed a poorly built, malnourished man with poor general condition. His left leg was swollen and tender to touch. Cardiovascular and abdominal examination was normal.\nChest X-ray demonstrated bilateral infiltrations and multiple cavitary lesions in both lungs []. Sputum examination showed acid-fast bacilli-positive smear. In view of swelling and tenderness in calf, possibility of DVT was considered. Ultrasound (USG) Doppler of the left lower limb revealed deep venous thrombosis in the left saphenofemoral vein [].\nStandard ATT with retreatment regimen as per the national guidelines was initiated. The patient was treated with enoxaparin subcutaneously and warfarin. On treatment, his general state improved and he responded well to anticoagulation therapy. Swelling in the limb subsided with decrease in tenderness. No adverse effects were seen. He was discharged 14 days after admission to continue follow-up. Follow-up Doppler at 3 months showed resolution of the thrombus with only minimal sluggish flow."
"A male preterm 980 g by birth weight was born to 25-year-old primigravida with 28 weeks of gestation. The baby was delivered with a cesarean section for the indication of fetal distress. In view of respiratory distress, the baby received single dose of natural bovine surfactant within half an hour of birth and was ventilated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. A PICL (Vygon, Germany) was inserted electively on the 5th day of life through the right saphenous vein. The chest X-ray confirmed the position of the catheter tip at the junction of inferior vena cava and right atrium just above the diaphragm. On the 7th day of life, the baby suddenly deteriorated in the form of desaturations, tachycardia, and hypotension. On examination, the neonate appeared cyanosed, with saturations of 85% and delayed capillary refill time. On auscultation, the heart sounds were feeble and blood pressure showed a systolic reading of 30 mm mercury. The baby was therefore immediately intubated and was put on mechanical ventilation with pressure control mode and 100% oxygen. Systemic hypotension was corrected with inotropes. In view of this sudden deterioration, a chest roentgenogram was called for, which showed marked cardiomegaly and a cardiothoracic ratio of 0.68 []. In view of the above findings, a two-dimensional echocardiogram was performed, which showed a massive PCE []. There was a diastolic collapse of the free wall of the right atrium, indicating cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was immediately performed, and 9 ml of yellowish fluid was aspirated through a subxiphoid percutaneous approach. Subsequently, the skin color of the neonate improved rapidly, his vital signs gradually returned to normal, and his oxygen requirement decreased from 90% to 30%. Echocardiography done later showed increased contractility with resolution of the PCE []. The PICL line was immediately withdrawn. Inotropic support was gradually reduced and omitted after 24 h; the pressure support for the baby was also gradually reduced and the baby was weaned off the ventilator the next day. Biochemical analysis of the obtained pericardial fluid revealed a glucose concentration of 1215 mg/dl and total protein of 0.1 g/dl. There were 100 red blood cells/mm3 and 50 white blood cells/mm3. The aspirated fluid was suggestive of total parenteral nutrition infusate. There was no further accumulation of fluid, and a follow-up echocardiogram after a week was normal. The baby was started on trophic feeds 3 days after pericardiocentesis. The patient was subsequently discharged, and a chest roentgenogram done before discharge showed a normal cardiothoracic ratio."
"A 25-year-old male presented to Out Patient Department with bruising and swelling over the anterior wall of left axilla. The patient was an engineer by occupation and amateur weight lifter. While doing his routine workout in the gym, the patient experienced severe pain and tearing sensation over the left side of the chest. Clinically, there was bruising, ecchymosis, swelling, altered anterior axillary fold crease, tenderness, and restriction of movements of left arm (). Muscle tear was suspected and hence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was advised () which showed tear of tendon of pectoralis major muscle. The patient was treated surgically by taking osseous sutures and reattaching the tendon to humerus. The arm was immobilized for 2 weeks. Active elbow and wrist exercises were started as soon as pain subsided. At 2 months follow-up patient had full range of movements ()."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a history of trivial fall from a ladder (5 Ft) and landing on the right heel. He complained of pain and swelling. On examination, he had swelling over the medial aspect of right heel (). The skin over the swelling was stretched and it was soft in consistency and tender. No relevant history and family history in view of bone cyst and malignancy. No evidence of any risk factors.\nRadiograph of right ankle revealed an eccentric, expansile, and cystic lesion of the calcaneum with thin septae traversing the cystic cavity giving it a blown out or soap bubble appearance. There was a cortical breach suggesting fracture (). In our case, we avoided computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) due to the expense, and we proceeded with biopsy and histopathological examinations, which is more informative.\nThe patient underwent two staged procedure: First for biopsy followed by second procedure after confirmation by histopathological examination.\nUnder strict aseptic precautions, biopsy was done under anesthesia. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination and it was diagnosed by a pathologist as aneurysmal bone cyst.\nA differential diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst or giant cell tumor with pathological fracture was made. Under spinal anesthesia and strict aseptic precautions, the lesion was curetted and the cavity was filled with iliac bone grafts ( and ). The curetted specimen was sent again for histopathological examination, and the diagnosis was confirmed (). The wound was closed, dressed, and below knee posterior plaster slab was applied.\nPostoperatively, a nonweight bearing crutch walking was allowed for 6 weeks followed by partial weight bearing for further 4 weeks. Follow-up was done on 3rd and 6th month of post-operative ( and ). The patient returned to his activities at the end of 6 months, and we are still continuing the follow-up because the recurrence usually happens within 1 year."
"The second case was a 25-year-old young man who was admitted to the Burns Intensive Care Unit on 6th February 2015 with 23% TBSA electric burn (≥1000 volts electric shock) injury. Accidentally, the hand of the patient, which held an iron rod, touched a live high tension electric wire (≥1000 volt). The patient was brought to the hospital within an hour of the accident. He had noticeable burns in the anterior trunk portion (13%) and had a tightening sensation on the chest region, but no anginal pain was felt by the patient. ECG findings during hospitalisation showed ST elevation along with ’T’ wave abnormalities. ECG was analysed, and the patient was shifted in ICCU for supervision of cardiac conditions. To evaluate the myocardial damage, cTnI level was assessed after 5 h of hospitalisation. The elevated cTnI blood level (11.0 ng/ml) in serum was reported. A serial time point study of cTnI was conducted also in this case and which shows the cTnI level in serum dropped to 0.65 ng/ml after 72 h of hospitalisation. During ICCU monitoring, there was no noticeable cardiovascular discomfort or complications reported and ECG was also normal. Echocardiograph findings enumerated that left ventricle was in normal size with 73% of LVEF without RWMA rest. The cardiac valves and pericardium were normal. This patient had also tachycardia and like the patient in Case 1. This patient also was nondiabetic and nonhypertensive. The burn wounds were excised, and autograph was done on post-burn day five. Right-hand wound which was holding the iron rod had a full thickness burn wound on the grip side. This was later covered with autograph. Wounds healed well and were discharged with usual instructions for rehabilitation.\nThe value of the cTnI reached its peak within first 5 h of the onset of myocardial damage due to high voltage electric shock in both the cases and came down to the normal in circulation after 72 h. The recovery in both the cases was uneventful without any cardiac problems during follow-up of more than 4 weeks."
"Following a motor vehicle accident, a 25-year-old female complained of intense neck pain, but remained neurologically intact. The lateral cervical radiograph showed an oblique fracture of the axis; the fracture diagonally separated the vertebra in two parts and extended from the body of the axis to the posterior elements. In addition, the computed tomography (CT) scan revealed several craniovertebral junction (CVJ) anomalies, which included spontaneous KFS fusion of the C2-C3 disc space and the C2-C3 right articular facets/laminae. Furthermore, the anterior C1-arch was bifid and there was a partial agenesis of the posterior C1 arch [Figure –]. Following immobilization in a halo vest for 3 months, the fracture fused, maintaining adequate alignment []. When contacted by phone 2 years later, she was asymptomatic."
"A 25-year-old male, a forest department worker, was brought to the Intensive Care Unit with a history of consumption of 2–3 seeds of “Ratanjyot.” Following this, he started feeling drowsy and had one episode of vomiting after around 1 h of consumption. Due to these symptoms, he preferred to lay down beside a lake in the forest. After sometime, he found a thick rope-like creature fallen on his chest which he immediately threw away. After a few minutes, he started developing pain in the right arm and difficulty in breathing. For this, he contacted his friends who rushed him to our hospital immediately. On examination, he was tachypnoeic, diaphoretic, and had central cyanosis with SpO2 of 70% on room air. Pulse rate was 110/min and blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg. Fang marks were seen on the right arm. Cardiovascular and abdominal systems were unremarkable. He had bibasal crepitation on auscultation. Central nervous system examination revealed drowsiness, responding to simple verbal command, both pupils were normal-sized reacting to light, bilateral ptosis, and single breath count <20. The patient was immediately intubated and put on mechanical ventilator support (volume control). Ryle's tube was inserted and activated charcoal was given after collecting the gastric aspirate for chemical analysis followed by gastric lavage. Foley's catheter was also inserted. His laboratory findings were all within normal limits including the serum cholinesterase levels. Chest X-ray was suggestive of mild aspiration pneumonitis (bibasal). The patient was put on injection ceftriaxone, injection levofloxacin, and supportive care. He was also started with anti-snake venom (150 units/500 ml NS IV over 1 h followed by 100 units/500 ml NS IV over 1 h after 6 h of first dose). Meanwhile, he was started with injection neostigmine 0.5 mg Q15 min for 5 doses followed by 0.5 mgQ4H and gradually tapered off over 5 days according to the clinical improvement of the patient. Meanwhile, an ophthalmologist was consulted for possible causes of toxins causing bilateral ptosis with normal pupils, and a diagnosis of mixed toxins of J. curcas and snake venom was suspected and treated accordingly, considering the patient's background. Gradually, the patient was weaned off the ventilator support over 5 days. The patient was successfully extubated and later on discharged in a hemodynamically stable condition. On further follow-ups, the patient was always in a stable condition and totally asymptomatic."
"We report a 25-year-old female patient with recurrent ulcers on the lower limbs for\nthe past four years. She reported onset with pustules, which progressed to\nulceration in the left medial malleolus region. Later, she noticed other similar\nulcers on both lower limbs, with disabling local pain. As a relevant medical record,\nshe had type 1 AIH. She was on prednisone (20 mg daily) and azathioprine (100 mg\ndaily) - precribed for AIH - and clobetasol cream 0.05%.\nPhysical examination revealed a deep ulcerated lesion on the lateral side of the\nright lower limb (RLL), about 5 cm in diameter, reaching the subcutaneous tissue,\nwith violaceous regular and undermined edges, and base with purulent exudate and\ngranulation tissue. We also observed two other ulcerated lesions on the lateral side\nof the RLL and an ulcer on the medial side of the RLL with similar characteristics\n(). Similar ulcers were observed in\nthe anterior aspect of the left lower limb (LLL) and the medial aspect of the LLL -\nthe latter particularly deep, with maceration on the edges and smaller adjacent\nulceration. A total of seven ulcers were observed ().\nHistopathological study of a lesion revealed unspecific, ulcerated, and chronic\ninflammation process ( and ). The search for mycobacteria, fungi, and\nsporotrichosis serology were negative. PCR for leishmaniasis and leishmanin skin\ntest were also negative. Laboratory tests revealed elevated C-reactive protein,\nglucose intolerance, and normal liver laboratory tests, except for the elevation of\ngamma-glutamyltransferase.\nWe started treatment with prednisone at a dose of 70 mg/daily (1 mg/kg/day). In the\nfirst week, we used dressings with silver sulfadiazine 1% on the lesions. From the\nsecond week, we used dressings with carboxymethyl cellulose 3% gel and Nystatin\nointment with zinc oxide - the latter only on the macerated edge of the ulcer in the\nleft medial malleolus region (candidiasis associated). We recommended resting and\nkeeping the lower limbs elevated.\nThe patient was discharged after 18 days of hospitalization, with the prescription of\nprednisone (60 mg/daily) and daily dressings as described above, as well as guidance\nto rest and elevate the lower limbs. Initially, we programmed the reduction of\nPrednisone by 10 mg per month. The patient returned a month after discharge showing\nhealing process in the ulcers (). Two\nmonths after discharge, the seven ulcers were completely resolved with use of\nprednisone 40 mg/daily. Three months after discharge, we still observed the complete\nhealing of ulcers with prednisone 30 mg/daily and emollient. At the time, we reduced\nthe prednisone dose to 20 mg/daily and kept emollient topical care ()."
"A 25-year-old woman with left breast cancer underwent a modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection followed by six cycles of chemotherapy and local radiotherapy to the chest. She was admitted because of a headache 1 year later. The contrast-enhanced brain MRI was performed, and it revealed that abnormal hyperintense signal and nodular thickness on the surface of the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, suggestive of LC []. She was referred for F-18 FDG PET/computerized tomography (CT) study to identify if there were any other metastases. PET/CT images showed increased abnormal FDG accumulations on both cerebellar and cerebral hemispheres surfaces with highly suspicious for LC [Figure and ]; multiple bone metastases involving vertebral column, sternum, iliac bones were also shown."
"A 25-year-old female seamstress presented after accidental ingestion of a 4.4 cm pin. Physical examination, comprehensive metabolic panel, and complete blood count were unremarkable. Plain film radiographs demonstrated a radiopaque 4.4 cm needlelike structure over the distal gastric body without pneumoperitoneum. Computed tomography (CT) imaging without contrast 2 h later showed the foreign body in the distal duodenum. As the needle was distal to the ligament of Treitz (), the decision was made to follow the patient conservatively per ASGE guidelines. After serial plain film imaging found no interval migration from the right lower quadrant by day 3, she was given oral bowel preparation for colonoscopy. On colonoscopy, the pin was freely mobile in the cecum and not impacted in the colon wall. Using hot biopsy forceps, the sharp end of the pin was secured and the scope carefully withdrawn with the hood pulled forward over the entire needle (). At about 40 cm, the pin jarred loose from the forceps. Because of the poor visualization due to the hood being pulled forward, the scope was withdrawn completely and the hood repositioned. The scope was reinserted and the same technique was used to secure the sharp aspect with forceps before pulling the entire pin into the hood. Once the foreign body was removed, the scope was reinserted to the sigmoid colon, revealing intact mucosa without perforation or injury. The patient was observed for 24 h and discharged without adverse events."
"A 25-year-old gravida 2, para 1, abortion 0, woman presented with 5 weeks pregnancy. She earlier had a home delivery where the baby had severe birth asphyxia and did not survive. She was found to be normotensive, had a normal glucose challenge test, and was B Rh-negative. ICT was found to be negative. On inquiry, she revealed that anti-D immunoglobulin had not been given to her in the last delivery. She was prescribed tablet folic acid 5 mg and was followed up with regular antenatal checkups. At 28+ weeks of pregnancy, her ICT was found to be positive in a dilution of 1:64. She was called for a Doppler sonography and reported at 31+ weeks of pregnancy. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) of middle cerebral artery (MCA) was found to be 45 cm/s, corresponding to 1.0 mean of median (MOM). She was monitored with measurements of PSV of MCA every fortnightly and PSV remained below 1.3 MOM till 35 weeks of pregnancy [].\nShe was administered short-course betamethasone to prevent hyaline membrane disease, and elective induction of labor was performed at 36+ weeks pregnancy.\nA 2.25 kg male baby was delivered vaginally with a good Apgar score. The baby was O Rh-positive with hemoglobin 13.2 g. Cord blood bilirubin was 2.21 mg/dl and direct Coombs test was positive. At 24 h of birth, the bilirubin was still 3.20 mg/dl. Since significant hyperbilirubinemia did not occur, the baby thus was discharged."
"A 25-year-old male complained of sore throat and fever with chills and rigors for 1 month, petechial hemorrhages for 20 days, and unexplained weight loss. He revealed a history of cigarette smoking (2–3/day). On examination, the patient had subconjunctival hemorrhage, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral submandibular and cervical lymphadenopathy. His baseline investigations at the time of admission showed hemoglobin (Hb) – 7.5 g/dl, TLC – 301,000/µL, and platelet count (PLT) – 20,000/µL. The patient was diagnosed as a case of biphenotypic acute leukemia (myeloid/T-cell) based on flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy (97% blasts). The patient was immediately started on intravenous hydration, antibiotics, and steroids for hyperleukocytosis.\nOn day 4, the patient developed altered sensorium and shortness of breath with further deterioration needing ventilator support. An increase in TLC (321,200/µL) was also noted. Emergency therapeutic leukapheresis was initiated. One blood volume (3.5 L) was processed, and 359 ml of ACD-A was used. The reduction in TLC was 156,200/µL (49%) []. No adverse events or procedure-related complications were reported. Postleukapheresis, the patient, was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRC) and 1 unit of PLT on cell separator (POCS) (23% reduction in PLT count) and was started on vincristine and daunomycin, followed by addition of L-Asparaginase (day + 2 postleukapheresis). The patient improved symptomatically and was gradually weaned of assisted ventilatory support. The patient was discharged on day 29 in hemodynamically stable condition. On follow-up (6 months), patient is asymptomatic and doing well."
"A 25-year-old housewife of Islamic faith presented at labor room of federal Medical Center, Gusau on the 16/8/2013 at about 4.30 a.m as case of expectant mother. She was unbooked G4P1+2,Ao non-alive patient. She presented with bleeding per Vaginal, abdominal distention, abdominal pain of 8 hours duration prior to admission. There was no drainage of liquor and last menstrual period could not be ascertained. Physical examination revealed a fully conscious young lady with Blood Pressure of 130/90 mmHg and moderately distended and tensed abdomen. No palpable fetal part and no obvious vaginal bleeding. The internal orifice of the uterus was closed and initial abdominal ultrasound conducted at labor ward revealed no fetal part. Attention of the Psychiatric Unit was drawn to the patient and further history revealed there was no visit to any hospital throughout presumed pregnancy. She had her first delivery, which was uneventful March 2010 at home. The baby however died 6 months after delivery.\nShe had 2 and 3 months miscarriages in 2012. She’s the 3rd wife of the husband, said to a trader. Other wives had children from her husband. No history of substance use. She’s premorbidly described as gentle, friendly and religious person.\nMental state examination revealed a calm and cooperative woman. Her speech was spontaneous, coherent and relevant. She had euthymic mood and no perceptual disorder. Cognitive function was normal and insightful. An assessment of pseudocyesis was made and repeat abdominopelvic scan and pregnancy test were conducted. She was transferred into post-natal ward for further observation. Repeat investigations revealed normal results and family counseling was carried out explaining to them the results of the investigation. They were thereafter reassured and discharged home after 48 hours of observation. She came for follow-up 2 weeks after discharged and remained clinically stable. She was referred back to O/G team for further assessment on her recurrent abortion."
"In 2015, a 25-year-old female laboratory technician developed a systemic reaction, approximately 30 min, after being bitten on her finger by a laboratory mouse. The allergic reaction included facial erythema and swelling, cough, and chest tightness. However, her previous laboratory mouse bites had resulted in only self-remitting local reactions. During the same time, she was on oral contraceptives and antihistamine for allergic rhinitis. She initially took antihistamine with little benefits and later received additional antihistamine, corticosteroid, and bronchodilator at the emergency room. In this case, also no epinephrine was administered. Her symptoms eventually resolved within an hour after receiving the aforementioned treatments. RAST for specific IgE antibodies against mouse and rat epithelium were found positive class 4 with a value of 42.40 KU/L and positive class 3 with 10.50 KU/L, respectively. This patient was not skin tested because of the fact that she had severe systemic reaction from breach to cutaneous barrier. She later resumed laboratory animal handling; however, without any direct contact with laboratory mice and rats."
"A 25-year-old male sustained a Gustilo and Anderson Type 3b open fracture of the distal 1/3rd femur. The radiographs revealed a comminuted fracture of the distal 1/3rd shaft of the femur extending to the intercondylar area with Hoffa's fracture. The patient was initially treated elsewhere and fracture was stabilized with 2 K-wires [Figure and ] with primary closure of the wound. The patient presented to us with foul smelling wound with copious amount of discharge coming out of it []. The patient was then treated with implant removal, and extensive debridement of dead tissues, muscle, and bone was done, resulting in 7 cm segmental bone defect of distal femur []. After repeated serial debridements; on 12th day, the articular fracture was reconstructed and fixation was done with locking compression plate and interfragmentary screw for Hoffa's fracture. Antibiotic cement beads were placed in the defect. Routine wound inspection was done to look out for any signs of infection. The patient required a few more debridements until it become evident that no sign of infection was present. Split skin grafting was done over the clean wound bed to cover overlying skin defect. After 14 weeks, Ilizarov ring fixator was applied and midfemoral corticotomy was done []. Bone transport began 7 days postcorticotomy at a rate of 1 mm/day in four 0.25 mm increments. Active knee motion was encouraged and gradual partial weight bearing was advised. Gradual bone transport was carried out till the bone docked distally after 78 days []. The transport segment was docked and fixed to the plate with 2 percutaneous screws and the Ilizarov ring fixator was removed []. Autologous iliac bone graft was grafted at the docking site. Total time in external fixation was 89 days. The patient was followed up for 3 years. The patient achieved good radiological bony union at both docking and distraction site and there was no recurrence of infection. There was no shortening present. The knee motion was 0–100° and the patient remains satisfied with his outcome []."
"A 25-year-old male weighing around 50 kg, with background history of schizophrenia, under treatment with olanzapine for 6 months presented to emergency department with somnolence and vomiting after 12 h of self-ingestion of 400 mg of olanzapine.\nAt presentation, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 12/15. His pulse rate was 90 beats/per min, blood pressure 110/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature of 98.5°F. Respiratory, cardiovascular and per abdominal examinations were normal. All the routine laboratory parameters including complete blood count, chest X-ray, 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), renal function, urine routine and microscopic examination, and random blood sugar were within normal limits. Arterial blood gas showed respiratory alkalosis. CPK levels were 5780 U/L, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 146 U/L, and serum aspirate aminotransferase (AST) was 100 U/L.\nHe was started on normal saline 175 ml/h and vitals were monitored continuously. Urine output of over 3 ml/kg/h was aimed. He had gradual improvement in GCS over 2 days. CPK levels were 4000 U/L; ALT was 100 U/L, AST was 60 U/L on the 2nd day. CPK level was ordered daily thereafter which revealed CPK of 3000 U/L on day 3, 1500 U/L on day four and it progressively decreased to 100 U/L on day 7 []. The patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit and then transferred to ward.\nHe did not receive any intramuscular injection, nor developed fever, seizure, electrolyte abnormalities during hospital stay and was discharged home after 8 days of hospital stay.

"A 25-year-old man was referred from a local hospital for evaluation of high levels of Hb and management of gout. There was no hepatosplenomegaly on physical examination. A complete blood count showed the following results: Hb 20.4 g/dL, hematocrit 58%, reticulocyte count 2.90%, white blood cell count 6.83×109/L, and platelet count 195×109/L. Bone marrow biopsy indicated no definite evidence of myeloproliferative features (). Mutations were not found in JAK2 V617 or exon 12, MPL W515K/L, CALR exon 9. Serum EPO level was within the normal range, 7.3 mIU/mL (reference range: 4.3–29.0 mIU/mL). No abnormalities were found on Hb electrophoresis. P50 (partial pressure at which Hb is half saturated with oxygen), which is an indicator of left-shift of oxygen dissociation curve (high oxygen affinity state) was calculated to be 14.3 mm Hg (reference value 22.6–29.4 mm Hg), using venous blood gas analysis (recommended by international federation of clinical chemistry). Congenital (familial) erythrocytosis was suspected. We performed alpha 1-globin gene (HBA1)/alpha 2-globin gene (HBA2), beta-globin gene (HBB), and Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene mutation analysis according to a previous study. All coding sequences and flanking intronic regions of HBA1/HBA2, HBB, and VHL were analyzed. Sequencing was performed by using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit on the ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence variation was described according to guidelines of the Human Genome Variation Society (). In case of HBB, the conventional numbering system was also used (Database of Human Hemoglobin Variants and Thalassemia mutations).\nIn HBB gene mutation analysis, we identified a mutation in exon 2 at nucleotide 310, replacement of a phenylalanine by a leucine residue [β103(G5)Phe→Leu, NM_000518.4:c.310T>C (p.Phe104Leu)], known as Hb Heathrow ()."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a 3 years history of psychotic symptoms. Detailed evaluation of the case revealed delayed motor milestones along with history of truancy, bullying, oppositional behavior, and poor academic performance throughout childhood and adolescence. The patient also indulged in occasional cannabis and alcohol use from 18 years of age. At the age of 22 years, he developed suspiciousness, hallucinations, and aggressive behavior along with significant sociooccupational decline. There was no significant past or family history. Detailed physical examination revealed dysdiadokinesia and dysmetria in the left upper limb. Patient had delusion of grandiosity, second and third person auditory hallucinations on mental status examination. Higher mental functions revealed impaired concentration, deficits in immediate and recent memory, poor general fund of information, concrete thinking, impaired judgment, and absent insight. Patient's routine blood investigations were within normal limits. His urine drug screen was also negative. A plain magnetic resonance imaging brain showed inferior vermis hypoplasia with communication of the fourth ventricle with cisterna magna without hydrocephalus, suggestive of Dandy–Walker variant []. Intelligence quotient was 81 (borderline intelligence) as tested by Wechsler Adult Performance Intelligence Scale. Neuropsychological assessment revealed moderate impairment in working memory and ideational fluency. In temporal lobe testing, his speech had poor productivity, paucity of content of speech, impairment in visual integration, moderate impairment in verbal learning and memory functions, and severe impairment in visual learning and memory functions. No impairment was noted in other lobe functions. The patient was diagnosed as a case of schizophrenia and started on oral antipsychotic olanzapine which was optimized to a dose of 15 mg/day. He showed partial improvement in the psychotic symptoms through the patient's speech and cognitive deficits remained static. One month postdischarge, patient continued to have stable cognitive deficits with partial resolution of psychotic symptoms."
"A 25-year-old G2P0, presented to the maternity department in MSF Agok hospital in South Sudan, on 14th of October 2016 with abdominal pain. She had not sought medical advice or antenatal care prior to this visit. Her pregnancy was estimated to be 34–35 weeks, as she did not know the exact date of her last menstrual cycle. She had been having progressive abdominal pain for 2 days. The pain was generalized and increased with movement. She had a previous miscarriage, and was concerned about this pregnancy.\nOn examination, the abdomen was mildly tender, and the fetal head could be easily palpated at the right upper quadrant. The patient had a normal blood pressure, with mild tachycardia at 100 bpm. Her haemoglobin level was 10 g/dl. Ultrasound scan was performed, which confirmed a live term fetus, in transverse lie, with no indication of extra-uterine pregnancy. Caesarean section was planned in view of the transverse lie.\nA Pfannenstiel (transverse lower abdominal) incision was used. A normal non-pregnant uterus was found, with the placenta attached to the fundus. The incision was extended to an inverted-T incision. A full term, live female fetus was delivered. There was active bleeding from the placenta, which was attached to the fundus and left cornual region of the uterus, the small bowel mesentery and the left lateral abdominal wall. Partial removal of the placenta was carried out to control the bleeding. Further inspection of the uterus revealed no evidence of perforation. Left ovary was found to be normal, but the left Fallopian tube could not be discerned. The right side ovary and tube were normal.\nPostoperatively, the patient had to be transfused due to intraoperative blood loss. She was started on antibiotic therapy. The baby was well, weighing 2.5 kg, and showing no obvious external congenital abnormalities. Both the mother and the baby were kept in the hospital for 2 weeks postoperatively, during which the mother recovered well from surgery, with no signs of infection or bleeding. They were discharged home, with a follow-up appointment in one month. The mother and child have been on regular follow up. The child has shown normal developmental milestones till date (6 weeks after birth)."
"A 25-year-old female presented with right eye sudden and painless blurring of vision for 4 weeks, who visited a hilly area in the Himalayas, North India. No history of headache, fever, stiff neck, malaise, nausea, redness, watering of eyes, floaters, and trauma was reported. Family and treatment history were negative. On examination, her visual acuity (VA) in the right eye was 20/60 (unaided) and 20/20 in the left eye. Anterior chamber was normal, relative afferent pupil defect was present, and fundus examination showed signs of papillitis, superior temporal retinitis contiguous with disc, vasculitis involving large vessels near the disc []. Examination with + 78 D revealed vitreous cells in the vicinity of neuroretinitis. Intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed the diagnosis of neuroretinitis [ and ]. Left eye examination was normal. Preauricular and submandibular lymphadenopathy was absent. Dermatologic and systemic examinations were normal. The patient was empirically started on oral steroids (prednisone 40 mg/day [1 mg/kg]).\nRheumatoid factor, Cytoplasmic Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (c-ANCA), Perinuclear Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (p-ANCA) (anti-myeloperoxidase) antibodies, antinuclear antibody, anti-double-standard antibody, angiotensin converting enzyme, human leukocyte antigen B-27, rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent treponemal antibody test, Treponema pallidum immobilization and T. pallidum hemagglutination assay for syphilis, toxoplasma titer, HIV ELISA were within limits. Lyme disease antibodies, IgG and IgM serum were 0.3 (<0.90) and 9.1 (<0.90). Mantoux test (5 mm × 5 mm), chest X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging head, and echocardiography revealed no abnormality.\nOn follow-up examination after 1 week, her VA dropped to hand movement close to face and signs of fluid retention were present. Fundus examination showed exaggeration of extent of all signs []. OCT showed neurosensory detachment []. Considering the worsening of signs, symptoms, and positive IgM tire for Borrelia burgdorferi, serum Western blot analysis test confirmed Lyme disease. Diagnosis of neuroretinitis associated with Lyme disease was made. Oral doxycycline 100 mg was administered twice daily for 6 weeks and prednisone was tapered over a period of 4 weeks. Four weeks follow-up showed VA of 20/20 right eye. Fundus and OCT showed settling of neurosensory detachment and reduction of intraretinal fluid [ and ]. IgM titer was 1.2 (<0.90). The patient was advised strict follow-up for a longer duration. One-year follow-up showed no recurrence."
"A 25-year-old woman with chief complaints of facial asymmetry and an anterior crossbite was diagnosed with a skeletal Class III hyperdivergent pattern with a Y-type skeletal asymmetry. Cephalometric and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) analyses (, and ) revealed a chin deviation to the left side in accordance with a mandibular yawing to the deviated side, with a longer mandibular body length on the right side and a longer distance from the right gonion to the midsagittal plane. Maxillary yawing to the deviated side was seen in the same direction as the mandibular yawing. The facial volume and width were more prominent on the right side than on the left because of the same directional anterior yawing of the maxilla and mandible. The maxillary incisors were tilted to the right, and the maxillary dental midline was deviated to the right from the apical base midline. The mandibular dental midline was shifted to the right side from the apical base midline. Intraoral examination revealed a Class III molar relationship, anterior crossbite, open bite, root rest of #15, extrusion of #17 and #27, very thin periotype, and midline discrepancy. Minor crowding and distorted dental arch forms with different anteroposterior molar positions in both dentitions were also observed ()."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of headache and transient right hemiparesis. She did not have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or other diseases. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a low-density lesion in the left frontal lobe, but CT-angiography showed no abnormal findings in the cerebral arteries. The 6-cm lesion involving the left frontal lobe showed low signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI and high signal intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (). There was no evidence of hemorrhage on susceptibility-weighted images (). The subcortical area of the lesion showed low signal intensity on diffusion-restriction images, and high signal intensity on an apparent diffusion coefficient map (). The subcortical area and leptomeninges had continuous linear enhancement after gadolinium administration (). The regional cerebral blood volume of the lesion was decreased on MR perfusion images, and the lactate peak was increased on MR spectroscopy (). The symptoms were aggravated by fever and seizures. The results of laboratory testing showed that the white blood cell count was 14,200/mm3, with neutrophil dominance (82.3%). C-reactive protein was elevated to 1.15 mg/dL. For the frontal lobe-involving lesion with vasogenic edema, mass effect, and contrast enhancement, the provisional diagnosis was a cortical and subcortical brain tumor, such as glioma or lymphoma. Biopsy was performed to rule out tumorous or other inflammatory lesions. Intraoperatively, the arachnoid membrane was focally thickened with yellowish discoloration, and the cortical and subcortical areas appeared normal (). The brain showed dominant lymphocytic infiltration in the small vessels (), and the lymphocytes were immunopositive for CD3 and CD79a (). The arachnoid membrane showed fibrotic changes. The patient did not have any underlying diseases, including immune diseases. The levels of antinuclear antibody, cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and rheumatoid factor were within the normal range. After high-dose steroid administration, the patient's symptoms improved. Two months later, follow-up brain MRI showed a reduction in the extent of the T2/FLAIR hyperintensity lesion, with decreased patchy subcortical enhancement in the left frontal lobe ()."
"A 25-year-old female presented with complaints of increased bowel frequency, oliguria, fever and abdominal pain since one month. Detailed history revealed that the patient had difficulty in micturition for past two weeks. The routine laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin of 7.8 gm/dL, total leucocytes count 3200 cells/mm3, platelet count of 70000 cells/mm3. Renal function tests revealed normal sodium concentration (139 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (8.2 mEq/L), hyperuricemia (74 mg/dL) and elevated creatinine levels (7.5 mg/dL). Coagulation profile was normal. Ultrasonography (USG) revealed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis with normal renal parenchyma and features of vesicoureteric reflux. The midstream urine sample was subjected to microbiological testing. The wet mount microscopic examination showed 1-2 RBCs, numerous pus cells and bacteria per high-power field[]. The semi-quantitative culture done on the cysteine lysine electrolyte deficient agar showed significant bacterial growth (colony count > 105 CFU/mL). The colonies were non-lactose fermenting, translucent, greenish blue, smooth having entire edges and became mucoid on prolonged incubation. Subculture on MacConkey agar showed pale, translucent, glistening colonies with entire edges (Figure ). Gram staining showed 0.5 μm × 2 μm gram-negative bacilli, with no spores and no capsule. The isolate was also subjected to conventional identification using a battery of biochemical tests. The isolate was catalase positive, oxidase positive, produced indole, was non-nitrate reducing, mannitol fermenting, esculin and gelatinase hydrolysis positive. Urease was produced and this test helped to distinguish it from E. meningoseptica. The isolate was confirmed as Elizabethkingia miricola (E. miricola) (identification score of 2.29) by using MALDI-TOF-MS (BrukerDaltonics, Bremen, Germany). The antimicrobial susceptibility was carried out using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method and the antibiotics tested were chosen from the available literature as there are no CLSI guidelines available till now[,]. The isolate was sensitive to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem, and resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, vancomycin and colistin. The patient was started on piperacillin-tazobactam and responded well to the treatment. The patient improved clinically and the follow-up urine culture after two weeks of therapy was sterile."
"A 25-year-old man, with no comorbidities presented with sudden onset anasarca and oliguria of 2 days duration. He was diagnosed to have hemorrhoids by a local physician and was prescribed oral ciprofloxacin for 5 days with a cumulative dose of 5 g, 10 days before this admission. On investigation, routine blood and urine examination revealed the following results. Hemoglobin 11.7 g/dl, total leukocyte count 5700, neutrophils 80%, lymphocytes 15%, monocytes 3%, eosinophils 2%, platelets 2.2 lakhs/L, S. creatinine 3.6 mg/dl, urea 140 mg/dl, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.9 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/L, calcium 8.5 mg/dl, uric acid 8.0 mg/dl, phosphorus 4.7 mg/dl, total proteins 6.6 g/dl, albumin 3.8 g/dl, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 21 U/L, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase 24 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 106 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 840 IU/L. His urine analysis showed pH of 6.0 and bland sediment without any significant proteinuria, hematuria, eosinophiluria, or leukocyturia. Autoimmune workup including serum rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies did not yield positive results. Serum complement levels were normal. HIV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus infections were ruled out. His serum creatinine had increased to 5.8 mg/dl during next 2 days. A percutaneous renal biopsy [] was done, which showed ten glomeruli; the glomeruli were unremarkable. Twenty-five percent of tubules shown needle-shaped crystals occupying the entire luminal circumference. These crystals were refringent under polarized light. These intratubular Birefringent crystals [] showed a granulomatous response. The granuloma was composed of epithelioid cells. In addition, there was lymphocytic infiltrate in the interstitium. He was managed conservatively with intravenous fluids. His renal function improved during 10 days, and his serum creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl at discharge."
"A 25-year-old male who planned to undergo corneal refractive surgery was referred to our corneal clinic due to suspected keratoconus because of astigmatism and decreased visual acuity in his left eye. He reported an interocular difference in visual acuity that began in childhood and claimed to have never had a decimal visual acuity in the left eye better than 0.8. The patient denied a recent decrease in visual acuity and had no further medical or surgical history.\nUncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was 0.2 in the right eye and 0.4 in the left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.8 in the left eye. Refractive error was −2.00 to 0.25 × 165 in the right eye and +1.75–4.00 × 10 in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed a horizontal band-like lesion at the level of Descemet's membrane and the corneal endothelium in the left eye (Fig. ). No remarkable corneal changes were observed in the right eye, and no other ocular abnormalities were observed in either eye. Noncontact specular microscopy (EM-4000; Tomey Ltd, Nagoya, Japan) revealed an endothelial cell density of 2,941 and 1,529 cells/mm2 in the right and left eyes, respectively (Fig. ). Central corneal thickness was measured using contact corneal pachymetry (SP-3000; Tomey Ltd) and was 531 µm in the right eye and 561 µm in the left eye. Corneal topography (OPD-Scan III; Nidek Co. Ltd., Gamagori, Japan) of the left eye revealed a bow tie with-the-rule (WTR) astigmatism (steep K = 43.55 D × 107, flat K = 41.46 D 3 17; Fig. ). The right eye had a mild WTR astigmatism (steep K = 42.83 D × 93, flat K = 42.08 D × 3; Fig. ). Interestingly, the corneal astigmatism flat cylinder axis corresponded to the band lesion axis in the left eye (affected eye; Fig. ). Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (Spectralis OCT; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) revealed an irregular, hyper-reflective posterior endothelial surface in the left eye (Fig. )."
"A 25-year-old female without the past and family history of psychiatric and neurological illness reported to the psychiatry outpatient department with complaints of over-talkativeness, big talks, irritability, over-familiarity, decreased sleep, and increased physical activity for the last 14 days. There was no history of any substance use. No ongoing stressor could be elicited. On evaluation, it was found that the patient was taking tablet cabergoline 0.5 mg twice weekly from the last 6 months. She had complaints of amenorrhea, breast pain, weight gain from the last 1 year, for which she consulted an endocrinologist. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed small subcentimetric lesion in the left half of pituitary gland, suggestive of microadenoma. Her serum prolactin level was 60.32 ng/ml (normal range: 4.79–23.3 ng/ml). She was started on tablet cabergoline 0.5 mg twice weekly. With this treatment, her amenorrhea and breast pain improved. She was regularly consulting the endocrinologist and continuing the same medication.\nA detailed medical evaluation, including a neurological examination, revealed no significant findings. Hematological and biochemical indices were within normal limits, including serum prolactin level (21.3 ng/ml). On mental status examination, euphoric affect and grandiose ideas and decreased need for sleep were elicited. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of the patient was 26. Possibility of manic episode induced by cabergoline was entertained. Cabergoline was stopped and the patient was started on lithium carbonate 800 mg per day along with lorazepam 1 mg per day. On consultation with an endocrinologist, MRI of the brain was done, and no abnormality was detected. As the patient was asymptomatic and her serum prolactin level was within normal limit, no further endocrine treatment was advised by the endocrinologist. After 10 days of treatment, her manic symptoms improved significantly. YMRS score of the patient decreased to 10. She was continued only on 800 mg lithium carbonate per day. On evaluation after 4 weeks of treatment, her manic symptoms have resolved completely and no further endocrinological symptoms reappeared during this period. Dose of lithium carbonate was tapered to 600 mg per day with the goal of ultimately discontinuing it."
"A 25-year-old female presented with right-sided involuntary facial twitching, predominantly over the eyelid and angle of mouth for the last 12 months. Neurological examination was unremarkable. MRI showed evidence of neurovascular conflict at the root entry zone of the facial nerve by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) []. After a retrosigmoid approach, the cerebellum was gently retracted superomedially and cisternal CSF released. The AICA vessel loop was found to be compressing the seventh nerve. Using standard microsurgical methods, the vessel and nerve were separated and Teflon felt was placed between them. From POD-1, her facial spasms resolved completely, but she developed mild HB Grade 2 facial palsy and was discharged on POD-4. Ten days after surgery, she developed worsening of her facial palsy to HB Grade 4 severity. She had no history of fever, auricular vesicles/rash. Imaging was essentially normal, except for the craniotomy defect. She was given a course of oral prednisolone starting at 1 mg/kg/day for 1 week and tapered over the next 2 weeks. After a follow-up of 7 weeks (5 weeks after DFP), her facial palsy had completely resolved."
"A 25-year-old man arrived in the emergency room 8 h after a motor accident in which a rope was wrapped around his neck. Initial pulse oximetry saturation (SpO2) was 94%. The vital signs included a blood pressure of 122/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 98 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 23 breaths/min, and an axillary temperature of 36.2°C. Because of the good general and respiratory condition of the patient on admission, the pathognomonic signs of laryngeal injury were not noticed. Patient had skin contusion and moderate crepitus on his neck area (Fig. ). His phonation was normal without dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis or hoarseness. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema were noted on a supine chest radiograph (Fig. ). Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck and chest revealed pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and distortion of laryngotracheal framework (Fig. ). Flexible bronchoscopy showed cricotracheal transection with normal movement of true vocal cord. At the same setting, endotracheal tube was advanced distal to the transection site under bronchoscopic guide (). Neck exploration demonstrated complete cricotracheal separation (Fig. ). The area was debrided and primary cricotracheal end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The patient was extubated 2 days after the surgery. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy on Days 20 and 90 showed that the tracheal injury healed completely with no apparent proliferation of granulation tissue."

"A 25-year-old right handed male was admitted in May 2010 with chief complaints of occipital headache for 2 months associated with complaints of giddiness, double vision and vomiting from 2 weeks. Patient also had h/o seizures once every 2-3 weeks from 2 months. On examination, patient was conscious, and had left VIth nerve paresis. Patient's vision was 6/9 bilaterally; fundus examination revealed bilateral papilledema. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain with contrast showed homogenously enhancing mass in atrium of right lateral ventricle which was moderately vascular on cerebral digital subtraction angiography and was supplied by branches of right middle cerebral artery and right posterior cerebral artery []. Patient was operated by a right temporoparietal craniotomy and Simpson Grade 1 excision was achieved via transcortical approach through inferior parietal lobule. Tumor was seen arising in trigone with no definite dural attachment. Patient was extubated at the end of surgery and remained neurologically intact. Biopsy was suggestive of angiomatous meningioma (WHO Grade 1). There was no evidence of malignancy [].\nAs per our protocol slides were reconfirmed. Postoperative scan revealed complete resection [Figures and ]. Follow-up MRI Brain with contrast at 6 months demonstrated small enhancing lesion in tumor bed suggestive of recurrence [Figures and ]. Since the lesion was small, patient was given options of either gamma knife or regular follow-up with MRI at 3 month interval. Patient presented in November 2012 with 2 episodes of seizures. MRI brain showed well enhancing dumbbell shaped lesion of size 4.6 × 4.2 involving trigone of right lateral ventricle with an extracranial part involving bone []. Patient underwent surgery for the same and complete excision was achieved; bone flap was discarded. Tumor was greyish, vascular and suckable and was firm at places. Biopsy revealed mesenchymal chondrosarcoma which was reconfirmed [Figure , ]. Patient was given adjuvant radiotherapy; a total of 55.8 Gy in 301 fractions were given over 6 weeks. Follow-up MRI at time of discharge, and at 6 months did not show any sign of recurrence []. Patient is on regular follow-up in our OPD and is doing well till date."
"This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Board of the InJe University Health Center.\nA 25-year-old female patient was admitted as an outpatient to the Plastic Surgery Department of our hospital due to experiencing severe pain, blepharoptosis, and decreased visual acuity immediately after receiving a filler injection. At the local clinic, the patient was injected with hyaluronidase promptly after the filler injection. The orbital pain and dizziness appeared 3 hours before admission; that is, during augmentation rhinoplasty with hyaluronic acid (Bellast, Dongkook Pharm. Co., Seoul, Korea).\nOn admission, ecchymosis on the left nasal ridge, ptosis of the left eye, a conjunctival injection, and a subtly dilated pupil in the left eye were observed. She experienced diplopia in all directions, and extraocular movement was limited to a right gaze.\nColor change and edema were found in the territories of the superior trochlear artery and angular artery, such as the forehead, nasal tip, and medial side of the orbit ().\nThere were no significant findings on magnetic resonance imaging or brain angiography. Partial retinal ischemia was observed on fundoscopy ().\nSystemic steroid injections were administered for 2 weeks, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered for 1 week. The skin lesion was dressed twice per day with an epidermal growth factor spray and antibacterial ointment. One week later, she had almost recovered from blepharoptosis and her limited extraocular movement had improved. The skin lesion was aggravated for 5 days but it progressively improved ().\nOnly redness remained after 2 weeks (). By 6 months, the skin lesion had improved with barely any scarring, and her persistent diplopia progressively resolved ()."
"A 25-year-old woman, with hypertension, presented to the emergency department at our medical centre with a markedly elevated blood pressure. This was the second emergency room visit within four days of a prior visit for the same complaint. During her previous visit, she was discharged on bisoprolol 5 mg twice daily, telmisartan 80 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, spironolactone 25 mg once daily and nifedipine 20 mg twice daily. Her uncle, who brought her to the hospital, reported severe hypotension (80/50 mmHg) with telmisartan so she has stopped taking it.\nHer blood pressure upon presentation was 218/150 mmHg, heart rate: 90 bpm, temperature 36.7℃, O2 saturation 100% and a BMI of 29.7 kg/m2. She reported dizziness, sudden onset headache, tinnitus, blurry vision, vertigo, nausea, fatigue and diffuse numbness. She reported compliance with a low sodium diet. She denied any chest pain, dyspnoea, haematuria, decreased urine output, seizures or muscle weakness. Review of systems revealed constipation, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities and intentional weight loss (37 kg over the past year). Her physical exam (including fundoscopy) was otherwise normal. Her laboratory tests including a complete blood count, chemistry profile, troponin and urinalysis were normal as well as an ECG and a computed brain tomography. Urine toxicology screen was negative for amphetamines and cocaine.\nShe was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 23. Earlier in her disease course, her blood pressure was relatively controlled. However in the past year, she has had recurrent emergency room visits for elevated blood pressure. She suffers from major depressive disorder which started after she lost her mother secondary to ruptured brain aneurysm three years prior to her current presentation. She was also diagnosed with anxiety and was recently started on escitalopram 10 mg once daily with weekly psychotherapy sessions.\nShe has a positive family history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, ruptured brain aneurysm in her mother and cardiovascular disease in her father.\nHer psychosocial history is complex. She lives with her father whom she describes as being abusive to her mother. She is close to her mother’s family, but she describes them as overprotective and they can be in total charge of her life.

"A 25-year-old female patient (weight: 52 kg and height: 162 cm) with dentofacial anomalies having both anterior edge to edge bite relationship and facial asymmetry was scheduled to have Le Fort I osteotomy and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSRO) surgery under general anesthesia. The patient was also diagnosed with factor XI deficiency with an increased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 87.5 seconds (normal: 26-35.3 seconds), and a factor XI activity of 5% (normal: 60-150%). Other laboratory values, including prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (PT INR) (1.06, normal: 0.8-1.2), and PT % (91.0%, normal: 80-120%) were within normal limits. The hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) and platelet counts were 12.8 g/dl (normal: 12-16 g/dl), 37.6 (normal: 36-48%), and 194,000/mm3, respectively. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram (ECG), and other laboratory findings were unremarkable. The decision was made to operate on the patient using both the SpHb and rotation thromboelastometry for effective perioperative management.\nDuring surgery, the patient's ECG, noninvasive blood pressure, percutaneous oxygen saturation, temperature, and arterial line were actively monitored. Intravenous thiopental 175.0 mg was used to induce anesthesia. The patient was intubated nasally after the administration of cisatracurium 12.0 mg. Anesthesia was maintained with 5-6% desflurane, 50% nitrous oxide and oxygen. The patient's vital signs were stable throughout the procedure (). The surgery time was total 250 minutes and the anesthesia time was 300 minutes. There was a total of 560 ml blood loss, and 500 ml of urine output. The patient's Hb levels were continuously checked through the SpHb values (). Four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and two autologous units of blood (360 ml) were used during surgery based upon the continuously monitored blood levels of Hb. At the end of surgery, the patient's Hb was 8.1 g/dl and Hct was 27%. The patient was extubated with the removal of the endotracheal tube when she resumed spontaneous breathing but before she recovered consciousness. The patient was transferred to the recovery room. The ROTEM™ analysis showed normal variables in the extrinsically activated test (EXTEM) and intrinsically activated test (INTEM) ().\nAfter surgery but before the patient's discharge, her bleeding tendency was investigated using coagulation tests including aPTT. Seven days after surgery, aPTT was slightly elevated at 48.4 seconds. The patient was discharged without any complications."
"A 25-year-old female presented with bilateral progressive decrease in night vision and reduced peripheral field of vision for 7 months, 3 months post full-term normal delivery of her first child. She had received a blood transfusion in the postpartum period. She was earlier treated with topical steroids and subsequently topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) with CME. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/6, N6 in both eyes. Anterior segment was unremarkable and fundus showed normal discs, attenuated vessels, RPE mottling, and suspicion of CME [].\nFundus fluorescein angiogram (FFA) showed perivenous patchy staining, RPE defects, and disc staining [], with normal fundus autofluorescence (AF) []. OCT showed cystic spaces [] and ERG was extinguished with nonrecordable scotopic and photopic responses []. Color vision and contrast sensitivity were normal. Humphrey visual fields 30-2 and full-field 120 screening showed constriction [Fig. and ].\nA provisional diagnosis of AIR was made with a differential diagnosis of a retinitis pigmentosa (RP) variant. She was started on systemic steroids (1 mg/kg body weight) with a tapering dose and advised AR-Ab testing.\nOne month later, her BCVA was maintained at 6/6, N6. OCT showed reduced cystic spaces with thinning of the inner segment-outer segment (IS-OS) junction at the macula, sparing the fovea []. AR-Ab testing (Oregon Health and Science University) was positive against 23 kDa (anti-recoverin) (HSP27), 30 kDa (carbonic anhydrase II [CAII]), 33 kDa, and 136 kDa proteins by Western blot (WB).\nMycophenolate mofetil (500 mg twice daily) was then added and she was regularly followed up at each visit with BCVA, OCT [], and ERG. Eighteen months later, she was symptomatically better with maintained visual acuity. Fundus showed fewer peripheral areas of RPE mottling with the absence of CME and an improved retinal sensitivity on the visual field [], while other investigations remained stable."
"The patient was a previously healthy 25-year-old male who began having sharp, left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath shortly after he returned to his home town at an altitude of 7,000 feet from sea level.\nChest X-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax and a chest tube was placed. Following resolution of his pneumothorax, the chest tube was removed and the patient was discharged only to return the following day with similar symptoms. Chest X-ray showed recurrent left-sided pneumothorax with no evidence of any lesions (Fig. ). Subsequent imaging showed left-sided lesion (Fig. ). Video-assisted thoracic resection of a left lower lobe wedge was performed. Gross examination revealed a unilocular bleb measuring 1.1 cm in size with clear resection margins. Microscopically, the collapsed bleb had a spindle cell proliferation in the cystic (bleb) wall which was covered with single layer of reactive mesothelium (Fig. ). The spindle cells focally extended into the immediate underlying lung parenchyma (Fig. , inset). The lesional cells were hyperchromatic with high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios and were arranged in orderly fascicles (Fig. ). There were 2 mitoses per 10 high-power fields and no tumor necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, which showed the spindle cells to be negative for cytokeratins (cytokeratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 5/6), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and Wilms tumor protein 1 (WT1). The neoplastic cells showed weak staining with CD99 and BCL2. FISH for a SS18 (18q11.2) rearrangement showed a break apart consistent with a translocation involving the SS18 gene characteristic of synovial sarcoma (Fig. ). Metastatic workup was negative. The patient received four cycles of doxorubicin/ifosfamide and is recurrence free 2 years after completion of chemotherapy."
"A 25-year-old young female with BMI of 41 kg/m2 had undergone an uneventful LSG. One month postsurgery, she developed recurrent vomiting with decreased food intake. She presented in ED after 3 months of surgery with 4 weeks history of paresthesia and weakness in both lower extremities that progressively increased to the extent that the patient became chair bound. Neurological examination revealed −4/5 power distally in the upper limbs and 3/5 in the lower limbs (more distally) with generalized areflexia, distal sensory loss, and impaired proprioception in all extremities. Her corrected serum calcium level was 8 (range 8.5–10.5), and Vitamin B12 level was within normal range. NCS showed diffuse sensory motor axonal peripheral neuropathy []. She was empirically treated with parenteral Vitamin B12 and B1 with oral folic acid and Vitamin E, D, and calcium. During her hospital stay, she also developed recurrent episodes of generalized body stiffness with the loss of consciousness (serial ictal electroencephalography did not reveal epileptiform activity, and patient's episodes were labeled as pseudoseizures) and depressive illness (received antidepressants). This patient remained hospitalized for 6 weeks. In her latest follow-up 4 months after the discharge from the hospital, she was able to walk with little support."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a swelling of the left submandibular gland for 2 weeks. The swelling was nontender, 1 cm × 1 cm and soft to firm in consistency []. The clinical differential diagnoses proposed were chronic sialadenitis, tuberculosis and salivary gland neoplasm. FNAC was done using 22-gauge needle and 20 mL syringe. Aspiration yielded fluid with granular particles. The smears were air dried as well as wet fixed in 95% ethanol and stained with May–Grunwald–Giemsa and hematoxylin and eosin, respectively. On cytology, fragments were seen as bluish fibrillary material corresponding to the parenchyma of the parasite with interspersed small nuclei [Figures –]. A fair number of lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils palisading histiocytes and degenerated cells in dirty necrotic granular background were noted []. A diagnosis of parasitic infection, cysticercosis of submandibular gland, was made. The patient was recommended antihelminthic therapy which resulted in complete resolution of the swelling."
"A 25-year-old man presented with numerous, discrete, round or oval, confetti-like, depigmented macules on his left neck (). Three years ago, he had undergone three sessions of 532-nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser treatment for café-au-lait macules on the same location in another hospital. After the last laser treatment session, the depigmented macules developed and persisted for 3 years without any change in color and size. Laser therapy-induced punctate leukoderma was diagnosed at our clinic, and treatment with the 308-nm excimer laser (XTRAC®; PhotoMedex, Horsham, PA, USA) was started with an initial dose of 175 mJ/cm2. The excimer laser treatment was performed twice weekly, and the dose was increased by 25 mJ/cm2 at each subsequent session unless erythema persisted for more than 48 hours. Repigmentation was first observed after 10 treatment sessions, and complete repigmentation was achieved after a total of 58 treatment sessions and 7 months (). The maximum and total cumulative doses were 700 and 31,950 mJ/cm2, respectively. Treatment was tolerable with no serious adverse effects that led to withdrawal from treatment. No recurrence was observed within 1-year follow-up."
"A 25-year-old man presented with swelling and pain in left ankle joint without any history of acute trauma. He had experienced another episode of severe swelling and pain in left ankle area without any preceding trauma about 2 years before arrival. After definite diagnosis of ABC by another surgeon in another hospital, He had undergone curettage and autologous bone grafting via medial ankle approach and detachment of deltoid ligament.\nEight months after previous surgery, pain and swelling had begun again and continued till the time of second operation. On examination, swelling and tenderness on medial side was clearly evident. The neurovascular status of left ankle and foot was intact. Range of motion of ankle was limited to 25 degrees in plantar flexion and 10 degrees in dorsiflexion in comparison to the right ankle. Moreover it was painful particularly in full plantar flexion. Left ankle plain radiograph showed a cystic lesion in posteromedial of left talus with invasion to the articular surface of tibiotalar and subtalar joints (Figure ). As ankle CT scan clearly approved the size and intra-articular invasion of the lesion (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging was not requested.\nSurgery was performed under general anesthesia in the lateral position after inflation of a thigh tourniquet using sterile conditions. Through direct lateral approach to the lateral malleolus, fibular osteotomy from 10 cm above tip of fibula was done and completely resected. The articular surfaces of tibiotalar and subtalar joints were removed. The ABC was carefully resected because of adhesions to the posteromedial structure of the ankle joint. The pathologic report confirmed recurrent ABC. After curettage, the bone graft from the excised distal fibula bone was impacted in the arthrodesis site. The correct position of tibiotalar and subtalar joints for fusion was prepared and fixed by a Steinmann wire temporarily. Finally, the fixation was achieved utilizing a compression screw and a PHILOS plate on lateral side from calcaneus to the distal of tibia. Short leg cast was applied till complete union at 3 mo postoperatively.\nFollow-up imaging at 18 mo after the operation showed no apparent sign of recurrence (Figure ). The patient has a little claudication due to triceps surae weakness. He also suffers from occasional pain after long-distance walking."
"A 25-year-old woman with diabetes presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of headache, right-side neck and shoulder pain and a 2-day history of intermittent fever, dry cough and odynophagia. Examination revealed a young woman, oriented in time, place and person. She was ill looking, afebrile (temperature 37°C), with a pulse of 115 bpm and blood pressure of 95/60 mm Hg. Respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and abdominal examinations were normal. Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs were negative. She had right-side neck tenderness and exudative tonsillitis."
"A 25-year-old Indian male presented with a history of pain and swelling in his right knee joint for 20 years for which he had received previous treatment in the form of simple analgesics only and had never reported to an Orthopedician. His physical examination revealed a soft, non-tender, palpable 3 cm × 3 cm mass on the lateral aspect of his right knee. In full flexion, the mass appeared more pronounced. It was compressible and filled back when the pressure was released. He denied any history of trauma, but there was a history of recurrent effusion in his knee. The patient had a near normal range of motion and no signs of instability. McMurray and Apley’s tests were negative. There was no difference in leg length, and there were no cutaneous lesions. Laboratory tests, including a complete coagulation profile, were all within normal range, and his medical, developmental, and family histories were unremarkable. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained (, , and ). The plain radiographs showed no abnormality, but the MRI was suggestive of a vascular synovial tumor and the differentials kept were synovial hemangioma and synovial sarcoma. Diagnostic arthroscopy and incisional biopsy were done in the same sitting. The mass was excised completely, and synovectomy around the medial patella-femoral compartment was done in the same sitting (, ). Some surrounding tissue showing bluish discoloration/inflammation was cauterized to prevent post-operative hemorrhage. The biopsy specimen was 4 cm in diameter, measuring synovial tissue. An intraoperative frozen section showed a hemangioma with huge, cavernous spaces but also containing capillary vessels. The final histological evaluation confirmed a cavernous synovial hemangioma (, , and ). Post-operative period was uneventful with no recurrent effusion."
"A 25-year-old female with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of abdominal pain rated 8/10 (at its worst) that had started 4 days prior to admission. It was accompanied with a sore throat that had started 1 week earlier, and was associated with generalised malaise and fatigue. Apart from her obesity and smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for eight years history (1 pack per day), her past medical history was unremarkable and she had no prior history of any trauma.\nIn the ED, she was afebrile, had a congested erythematous throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, and tenderness in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen on palpation. There was splenomegaly noted on examination but no guarding. Routine labs were remarkable for a lymphocytic predominance with a normal white blood cell count. Clotting profile (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and INR) was normal along with liver function tests. Hepatitis and HIV panels were also negative. Serological and polymerase chain reaction tests for Epstein Barr virus were positive and confirmed the diagnosis of IM. The EBV viral capsid Ag Ab IgM – 1.94 (normal <0.9). The EBV early Ag AB – 1.54 (normal <0.9). The EBV nuclear Ab was negative, and EBV DNA by PCR was 3548. The abdominal computed tomography scan showed an enlarged spleen measuring 15.3 by 6.0 by 14.5 cm with a wedge-shaped infarct (). Further evaluations with an electrocardiogram were unremarkable.\nSubsequently, the patient was managed conservatively in the hospital and was discharged without any complication, with strict instructions to avoid any contact sports for at least 6 months."
"A 25-year-old male presented with bowel incontinence and difficulty in micturition for 4 days. He also had a history of low back pain for 4 years with radiation to the left leg till toes. For past 15 days, he complained of the right leg pain along with numbness. On neurological examination, his power of both extremities, proximal, and distal was found to be 5/5 on Medical Research Council scale. The deep tendon reflexes on the affected side were reported to be normal. However, they were found to be brisk on the left side. His straight-leg raise test was found to be 30° on the right side. He had absent anal reflex and decreased perianal sensation, typical of saddle anesthesia.\nThe patient had an arachnoid cyst reported at the level of conus medullaris on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 4 years ago when he had lower back pain with leg radiation. His pain settled with medications and the patient was symptom-free since then. A repeat MRI of Dorsolumbar Spine was done, which showed an increase in the size of the cyst. He underwent laminectomy for excision of an arachnoid cyst, at the level of L1 and L2.\nMRI images obtained through lumbosacral spine were acquired both with and without intravenous contrast. The conus medullaris had asymmetry at the level of L1/L2, and filum terminale was deviated anteriorly and superiorly with arching of the nerves. There was an increase in angulation compared to the previous scan, as the size had increased [Figure –].\nHe underwent an L2–L3 laminectomy and after dural opening had near total excision of the arachnoid cyst under microscope. At surgery, the cyst appeared to be filled with clear fluid, delineated on outer and inner aspect by a delicate transparent membrane [Figure and ]. On microscopic examination, a cystic lesion of delicate fibrovascular tissue lined by cuboidal to low columnar meningothelial lining was found [].\nThe patient's pain settled, and he regained sphincter control immediately after surgery. However, slight numbness persisted in the right leg. He was discharged after 3 days, and a follow-up MRI scan showed resolution of cyst with decompressed conus."
"The third case was a 25-year-old woman who developed obsessive-compulsive symptoms at the age of 12 years. She has a family history of psychiatric disorders: her father and her grandmother were affected by major depressive disorder, while her brother and an aunt experienced a generalized anxiety disorder. Neither substance abuse nor medical comorbidity was reported by the patient. When she started university at the age of 19 years, she showed a worsening of obsessive symptoms and received treatment with citalopram 25 mg/day for 1 year. There was an improvement of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but also a switch to hypomania, followed by a major depressive episode. In the last 5 years, the patient presented with several episodes of mood alteration (including three spontaneous hypomanic episodes, two major depressive episodes, and one episode of antidepressant-induced hypomania) and has been followed up at our outpatient clinic with a diagnosis of BD type 2. The patient received only citalopram during major depressive episodes (the last two treatments in combination with a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic different from quetiapine). At T0, she experienced a moderate major depressive episode (T0: YMRS = 7; HAM-D = 21; HAM-A = 27; BPRS = 32) and pharmacotherapy with quetiapine ER 300 mg/day was prescribed. The patient showed an amelioration of depressive symptoms, but also a switch to hypomania (after 10 days). The rating scale scores were the following: T1: YMRS = 10, HAM-D = 17, HAM-A = 25, BPRS = 30; T2: YMRS = 15, HAM-D = 7, HAM-A = 18, BPRS = 25. After 1 week (T1), quetiapine and norquetiapine plasma concentrations were found to be respectively, 33.7 and 42.5 ng/mL (ratio = 0.79).\nAfter the hypomanic switch, all three patients received higher doses of quetiapine, which were titrated up to 800 mg/day to have an anti-manic effect. However, no cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor was introduced in the treatment of these patients. During the period between T1 and T2, none of the patients satisfied the criteria for a major depressive episode with mixed features. In the next month after T2, patients showed an amelioration of hypomanic symptoms till the remission (YMRS < 7). No patients developed substantial depressive symptoms (HAM-D < 4). This is not surprising as a recent report showed quetiapine is a slow but effective anti-manic agent []."
"A 25-year-old man was referred to the Department of Urology, SGPGIMS, India for recurrent right PUJ stricture.\nHe had undergone open pyelolithotomy for right staghorn calculus []. In the postoperative period, he had persistent nephrostomy output. A nephrostogram was done after 1 month that showed complete cut-off of contrast at PUJ []. He subsequently underwent antegrade endopyelotomy and double-J stent placement. Following double-J stent removal after 3 months he again developed progressively increasing right flank pain and hydronephrosis for which percutaneous nephrostomy was placed. Then the patient underwent right ureterocalicostomy with 6/26 Fr double-J stent placement. Following double-J stent removal after 6 weeks, the patient again developed right flank pain hence double-J stent was replaced.\nThe computed tomography [] shows that though there seems to be a patent anastomosis between the inferior calyx and ureter, the lower pole parenchyma has not been amputated which was most likely the cause of obstructed drainage whenever double-J stent was removed.\nWe at SGPGIMS did a redo ureterocalicostomy with lower pole nephrectomy. Intraoperatively, there were dense periureteric adhesions. Careful dissection and a double-J stent were helpful in identifying the lower pole and ureterocalicostomy site. A guillotine lower pole nephrectomy followed by ureterocalicostomy was done with vicryl 4–0 []. Postoperative period was uneventful, and a double-J stent was removed after 6 weeks. The patient is doing well now after 6 months follow-up with documented normal drainage on nuclear studies."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported with a complaint of pain, swelling and pus discharge from upper left posterior teeth region since 3 months. He had undergone an extraction of decayed 26 three months ago. On extra oral examination, there was mild swelling causing asymmetry on the left side of the face. Intraoral examination revealed pus discharge from the extraction site in relation to 26. Buccal cortical plate expansion was seen from 24 to 27 regions obliterating the buccal vestibule. The swelling was oval shaped bony hard and well defined and measured 3×2 cm in diameter. Excision of the lesion was done. The histopathological sections showed sheets of odontogenic epithelial cells that formed prominent intercellular bridges. Areas of extracellular, eosinophilic, and amyloidlike material with formation of concentric calcifications (Liesegang rings) were also present. Histopathological features were suggestive of the calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor (CEOT). The stroma also showed hyaline rings as double layered refractile membranes appearing as round or irregular structures enclosing amorphous material consistent with degenerated starch cells in the dense chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The cellulose envelope was PAS positive. Post-surgical follow up did not reveal any recurrences."
"On June 14, 2014, a 25-year-old male patient visited our outpatient department via the emergency center. Clinical examinations showed pain on both side of the jaw, open bite, and mouth opening limitation. On preoperative radiographs, both condylar fragments were displaced to the medio-inferior position and overlapped the ramus.() Postoperative radiographs showed good anatomical reduction of both condylar fragments in the glenoid fossa.() On postoperative 1-month radiographs, there were signs of displacement of both condylar fragments with right plate fracture and left screw loosening.() However, the postoperative 4- to 6-month radiograph showed bone remodeling at the displaced fracture site with increased radiodensity. Finally, the postoperative 2-year radiograph showed complete remodeling of the condylar fragments with restored anatomic appearance.() There were no signs or symptoms of mandibular condylar dysfunction during the healing and remodeling periods."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with moderate pain in the right preauricular region. The patient had a history of fall and a direct hit to the mandible. History of bleeding and inability to open his mouth were also reported. Clinical examination revealed pain in the right preauricular region that was exacerbated on mouth opening and presence of edema in the EAC. CBCT showed a right TPF and complete obliteration of the EAC.() The patient was advised to follow conservative treatment, and symptoms subsided within five weeks."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported with a growth over the anterior rugae region of hard palate present since 3 years. The growth was smooth and shiny, pedunculated, in appearance and slightly pale in color as compared to the normal mucosa measuring 5 cm × 2 cm in dimension and situated in the region of anterior hard palate [].\nOn histological examination, hyperkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium overlying dense connective tissue stroma was reported. The epithelium showed areas of keratin plugging along with collection of sebaceous glands in subepithelial regions. These lobules contained undifferentiated cells in the periphery and mature sebocytes with clear cytoplasm in the centre. Sheets, islands and cystic spaces of squamous epithelial cells and sebaceous cells were seen, without any cellular atypia or mitosis []. Underlying connective tissue was dense fibrous and collagenous containing numerous blood vessels along with areas of adipose tissue. Based on histological appearance, diagnosis of fibroepithelial hyperplasia with ectopic sebaceous gland and keratotic plugging was given."
"A 25-year-old female from Syanja district was admitted in our hospital with shortness of breath. She had complain of chest pain, cough with production of blood tinged sputum. Her CT scan showed small pneumothorax and peripheral blood smear revealed eosinophilia (41%). She had the history of consumption of raw crab for rapid healing of her fractured bone."
"A 25-year-old, junior public health nurse at 27 weeks of her first pregnancy presented to us with oscillopsia of the left eye of 1-month duration. She had intermittent vertical double vision during the episodes of oscillopsia, and it was aggravated by looking toward objects on the right side. She had multiple episodes occurring unpredictably on a daily basis and worsening of the symptoms with reading, using computer and with outdoor activity on sunny days. She had noticed that with slight head tilt to the right and chin up posture, her symptoms seemed to improve. There was no tinnitus, vertigo, vomiting, or headache. There was no history of deviation of eyes, blurred vision or any neurological complaints. She was not on any medications. There was no history of any systemic diseases, surgery or trauma. No alcohol, tobacco, substance, caffeine abuse, or drug allergies. She had an uneventful antenatal course. No history of multiple sclerosis or neurological disorders in the family\nOn examination, her unaided visual acuity was 20/20 both eyes, near vision was N6. There were occasional jerky repeated movements of intorsion of the left eye on dextrodepression, which increased on exposure to flashlight for 5–10 s. There was no ocular deviation, no evidence of vertical misalignment. Anterior segment, fundus, automated visual fields, color vision, and stereoacuity were normal. Intraocular pressure (Goldmann applanation tonometry) was 18 mmHg in both eyes. Hemogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and urinalysis were normal. Antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal, no evidence of vascular compression.\nThe diagnosis of the left eye superior oblique myokymia was made. Since she was pregnant, we decided to observe her, and she was given tinted spectacles for outdoor use.\nShe presented 5-month postpartum with worsening of symptoms after resuming her work, especially with outdoor activity. She was prescribed timolol maleate 0.5% ophthalmic solution twice daily for 1 week. At 1 week follow-up, there was subjective improvement in the quality of vision and there was no oscillopsia. Timolol maleate 0.5% ophthalmic solution twice daily was continued for 3 weeks. On holding the drops, oscillopsia episodes were less frequent and less bothersome, and she was symptom-free after 4 weeks. After 18 months of onset of symptoms, she conceived for the second time, and there was no recurrence of the symptoms during pregnancy or lactation."
"Our patient was a 25-year-old man with severe thigh pain and right-sided back pain. On the patient's examination there was no significant finding except pain on the right lumbar region palpation. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a spinal tumor image at the L3 vertebral level. The lesion was 1 cm in diameter. The boundaries of it could be clearly distinguished. At the same time, it was contrasting (). The patient was operated after the preoperative preparations were completed. The tumor was intradural. His borders were fully distinguishable and rounded. So the lesion showed a benign image. Immediately after the operation, all the pain of the patient was improved. The patient was very comfortable within the postoperative two days. The patient was mobilized early in the first 24 hours. On the third postoperative day, severe headache, nausea and vomiting complaints developed in the patient. Immediate cranial computed tomography (CT) examination was performed in the patient. Cerebral pneumocephalus was present in CT (). In our case, immobilization and abundant hydration provided healing. The treatment was successful and after three days all of the complaints of the patient had improved. At the same time, this improvement was confirmed by performing the cerebral CT examination ()."
"A 25-year-old, systemically healthy female patient reported with the chief complaint of mobility in lower front teeth and difficulty in maintaining oral hygiene in lower front teeth. The patient had not taken dental consultation before. She did not want to get her teeth extracted. She was diagnosed with localized severe[] chronic periodontitis in relation to 41, degree 2 mobility (Miller's index[]), shallow VD, limited AG, and radiographic bone loss [ and ]. Phase I therapy was given, which included oral hygiene instructions, scaling, and root planing. Esthetic permanent fiber splinting was done on the lingual aspect of teeth #43, 42, 41, 31, 32, and 33 for stabilizing mobile teeth (Bondable Reinforcement Ribbon, Ribbond Inc., Seattle, USA). Routine blood investigations were advised which were within the normal limits. One month after Phase I therapy, the patient was subjected to surgical procedure.\nUnder local anesthesia, periodontal surgical debridement was done using conventional flap for reconstructive surgery[] []. Synthetic bone graft material, β-tricalcium phosphate (Resorbable Tissue Replacement [RTR], Septodont Ltd., UK), was placed in the crater defects around tooth #41. Immediately following the debridement, the flap was sutured to its original position using 3-0 silk sutures (MERSILK™, ETHICON Inc., USA). A pull on MG on slight outward movement of the lip was observed []. A horizontal incision with diode laser (DenLase, Diode Laser Therapy System, Daheng Group Inc., China; laser parameters: wavelength-810 nm, output power: 0.5W–7W, continuous wave [CW], and contact mode) was given at the line of tension, 1–2 mm away from the MG to detach the fibers from underlying periosteum, leaving the sutures intact []. Care was taken not to expose the periosteum and bone to laser beam. The VD was increased by separating the muscle attachments and placing them apically by 6–8 mm. The surgical area was covered by noneugenol periodontal dressing (COE-PAK™, Periodontal Dressing, GC America Inc., USA). Ibuprofen 400 mg three times a day was prescribed for 3 days to relieve any postoperative discomfort. Regular postoperative instructions were given, and the patient was recalled after a week. Periodontal pack and sutures were removed. The patient was given instructions in oral hygiene maintenance and advised to do gentle gingival massage in the surgical area. After 1 month, there was a significant gain in WAG and VD [ and ], and the results were stable after 6-month follow-up also with an improvement in clinical attachment level [ and ]."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a growth in the left lower eyelid which started as a small lesion and gradually increased in size over the last 3 years. There was no preceding trauma. There was a history of a similar lesion in the left malar region just below the site of the present growth, which was operated elsewhere 5 years back. On examination, a single sessile, reddish growth measuring 4 cm × 3 cm in size was present in the left lower eyelid. It was firm and rubbery in consistency, noncompressible, with irregular margins, and nonpulsatile. There was no bruit. There were no similar lesions elsewhere. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was suggestive of vascular tissue. All routine blood investigations were normal. Slit lamp and fundus examination were normal. Ultrasound of the abdomen was normal. Left infraorbital Doppler showed well-defined superficial hypoechoic lesion in the left lower eyelid partially abutting the left globe. Computed tomography (CT) orbit (plain and contrast) and three-dimensional (3D) CT scan (volumetric rendering technique [VRT]) were suggestive of intensely enhancing mass lesion – hemangioma in the left infraorbital region with multiple feeding vessels, the prominent one being the left ophthalmic artery entering the lesion from the lateral aspect []. There was no evidence of bony involvement. The patient was subjected to surgical excision using cutting diathermy followed by reconstruction of the cartilaginous defect using auricular concha fabricated to suite the curvature of the lower eyelid contour. The orbicularis oculi muscle defect was closed by mobilizing the remaining muscles to cover the cartilage graft. The cutaneous defect was resurfaced with thick split-thickness skin graft taken from the medial aspect of the arm []. Excisional biopsy revealed a mass composed of lobules of thin- and thick-walled blood vessels lined by endothelial cells in the subepithelial tissue suggestive of capillary hemangioma []. No recurrence was noted postexcision. The patient was satisfied with the esthetic outcome []."
"The premature female was born at 33 weeks of gestation to a 25 years old mother, gravida 3 para 2, with a history of pre-eclampsia in the previous pregnancy. In this pregnancy, the fetus was found to have Trisomy 18 karyotype by amniocentesis. Fetal ultrasound at 21 weeks gestational age showed left displacement of the heart and absent nasal bone. The mother presented to at 33 weeks of gestation for premature rupture of membranes and contractions. Fetal ultrasound performed at that time showed normal amniotic fluid volume, intrauterine growth restriction with estimated fetal weight of 1519 grams (less than the 10th percentile for gestational age), right side congenital diaphragmatic hernia with liver herniating into the thorax, left mediastinal shift of the heart, hypoplastic left lung, and clenched hands with limited movement of upper extremities suggestive of arthrogryposis. Doppler interrogation of umbilical artery was normal. The baby was delivered by cesarean section.\nAt the time of birth, the infant was floppy and apneic for approximately 8 minutes requiring stimulation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation. APGAR score was 1, 2 and 4 at 1, 5 and 10 minutes, respectively. Intubation and resuscitation were not performed given the poor prognosis, and she expired at less than one hour of life.\nOn postmortem examination, the newborn exhibited numerous features associated with Trisomy 18 which included the following: lanugo on the torso and arms, micrognathia, microstomia, left low set ear with small flat pinna and closed ear canal, bilateral clenched fists with index and fifth fingers overlapping the third and fourth fingers, rocker-bottom feet, narrow pelvis, large right diaphragmatic hernia, and left pulmonary hypoplasia. No cardiovascular and genitourinary defects were identified. The placenta was small for the gestational age weighing 250 grams (normal is 342 grams for 33 weeks of gestation).\nAlthough no abnormalities were noted on gross examination of the pancreas, microscopic examination revealed an area measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension characterized by branching duct-like structures and cysts lined by cuboidal epithelium that measured up to 0.2 cm. Primitive mesenchymal proliferation and exocrine gland formation were found in between (, and ). A proliferation of spindle cells forming a collarette around the cysts were highlighted by Masson’s trichrome stain (). A diagnosis of pancreatic hamartoma was rendered. The uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma showed normal exocrine and endocrine components, congestion and extramedullary hematopoiesis."
"Patient 1 was a 25-year-old G2P1 with history of asthma, obesity, and prior miscarriage who had given birth to her first child 5 days previously when she presented with exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, nonproductive cough, bilateral lower extremity edema, and weight gain. Echocardiogram at presentation revealed an EF of 25% with a globally hypokinetic left ventricle (LV), left ventricular internal diastolic diameter 62 mm, dilated mitral annulus with moderate mitral regurgitation, and enlarged right ventricle with elevated right ventricular systolic pressure of 56 mm Hg. She underwent diuresis with significant symptomatic improvement and discharged on fosinopril 20 mg daily. She was followed closely with cardiology over the following 12 years. Initially, her EF improved and first normalized at 4.1 years after diagnosis. It subsequently dropped to 30% without clear heart failure symptoms or identifiable trigger and 1 year later normalized again to an EF of 60%. Review of her chart revealed several instances of medication noncompliance, and she required refills on scripts only about every other year. It is unclear which, if any, medications she was taking at the time of her acute decline in function. She was subsequently lost to follow-up."
"A 25-year-old pregnant woman was referred to ultrasound due to proteinuria. She was 13 weeks pregnant and feeling well. Ultrasound showed a 2.5 cm mass in the lower pole of the left kidney []. Color and Power Doppler were inconclusive regarding vasculature. The differential diagnosis included tumor and dromedary hump and the patient was scheduled for renal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). One week later, still before the MRI examination, it became possible for us to rescan with SMI. With SMI, the mass lesion showed normal-cortical vasculature [], confirming the diagnosis of dromedary hump."
"A 25-year-old woman visited our hospital for left mandibular third molar extraction. She had no notable medical history. Before surgery, she complained of gastrointestinal discomfort after taking prophylactic antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but her symptoms had improved. To extract the third molar, IANBA was performed on the left side. For local anesthesia, 1.8 cm3 of lidocaine with epinephrine in a 1:80000 ratio (Huons Lidocaine HCL and Epinephrine Inj. [1:80,000], Huons co. LTD, Sungnam, Republic of Korea) was used. Immediately after anesthetic injection in the left mandibular foramen area, the left side of the patient's face turned pale white, and she complained of pain and discomfort in the left facial area (). Aspiration was not performed during injection.\nThereafter, she complained of pain and discomfort extending from the middle left facial region to the left orbital region, including the eye. After evaluating facial nerve function, we confirmed that the symptoms were not related to any complication caused by anesthetic injection into the facial nerve. Although the patient chiefly complained of eye discomfort, she showed no signs such as the inability to close the eye or weakness of the frontalis associated with facial nerve paralysis (). The patient was observed in a supine position. Signs indicating blanching were observed from the outside of the nose, upper lip, central facial region, and the left zygomatic area. The patient complained of discomfort accompanying pain in the region with blanching, especially around the eye. The symptoms had occurred immediately after anesthetic injection and became severe within 1–2 min. The symptoms remained stable, but they improved after more than 10 min (). The patient's pain symptoms also improved, but the ischemic sign in the left facial region did not improve completely, especially in the lateral nasal area.\nAs the patient did not complain of severe symptoms and showed improvement, her current condition was explained to her, and surgical extraction of the left mandibular third molar was performed. After extraction, her progress was monitored until her symptoms completely improved approximately 40 min after the initial facial blanching sign. She was informed again that it was a complication of anesthesia. We decided to conduct additional examinations and treatment if the symptoms reappeared after discharge. No notable additional symptoms were observed."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with right-sided flank pain for 2 years. She was referred to us for ultrasonographic examination that shows severe hydronephrosis of the right kidney and dilated right upper ureter. No renal or ureteric calculus was found. The left kidney was ectopic and malrotated, lying in the left iliac region. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) urography of the patient was carried out in a multidetector CT scanner with a split-bolus technique. After acquiring plain CT of the kidney, ureter, and bladder region, the patient was taken out of the gantry, and 30 ml of nonionic iodinated contrast was injected intravenously. After a 2 h delay, an additional 60 ml of nonionic contrast was administered at a rate of 3 ml/s. A longer interval was chosen anticipating delayed excretion of gross hydronephrotic right kidney. The contrast-enhanced abdominal phase images were acquired 60 s after the second contrast bolus yielding images in synchronous nephrographic and excretory phases. After 15 min, a delayed scan was taken. CT scan revealed splitting of infrarenal IVC into two parts and rejoining inferiorly after a length of 4.2 cm []. The midureter is coursing posterior to the IVC and passing between the split segment of IVC causing narrowing of the ureter [Figures and ]. The ureter proximal to this segment appears dilated and tortuous. The left kidney was ectopic and malrotated. The left ureter was normal in caliber up to the ureterovesical junction."
"A 25-year-old female presented for routine prenatal care. She was a G3P1011 and had had one elective abortion as a teenager and one full-term delivery 3 years prior. She had preeclampsia with her previous pregnancy and was induced around 39 weeks’ gestational age. More details of this prior pregnancy were unavailable. During the third pregnancy, her blood pressure and urine protein were monitored closely. At 22 weeks and 2 days gestational age, she had early 24-h urine that was mildly elevated at 340 mg but had normal blood pressures and was asymptomatic. She was started on a baby aspirin daily, which she continued throughout her pregnancy. By 32 weeks and 2 days gestational age, she had another 24-h urine that was severely elevated at 770 mg. She still had normal blood pressures and was asymptomatic. At 37 weeks and 1 day gestational age, she presented with worsening lower extremity edema, headaches, intermittent spots in her vision, nausea, and vomiting. Her blood pressure was still normal and her deep tendon reflexes were normal. She had an elevated protein/creatinine ratio in her urine of 1.69 mg/dL (normal is <0.3 mg/dL). Her pregnancy-induced hypertension panel was normal. As she did not meet the criteria for preeclampsia, the decision was made to expectantly manage with close follow-up. The next morning, she was still symptomatic with headaches and nausea despite medications; however, her blood pressure remained normal. At this point, the decision was made to admit her in the hospital for induction of labor secondary to atypical preeclampsia with severe features. She was given intravenous (IV) magnesium during her induction and in her immediate postpartum period. She delivered a baby girl vaginally at 37 weeks and 3 days gestational age. The neonate was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress and was diagnosed with hyaline membrane disease and right-sided pneumothorax. She received two doses of surfactant and was discharged home on day 8 of life. At the mother's 6-week postpartum visit, she still had proteinuria with 3+ protein on her dipstick urine. She will be worked up for other causes of proteinuria."
"Paresh is a 25-year-old man with an advanced osteosarcoma. He was diagnosed when he was 20 years old and underwent an above the knee amputation of the right leg. He did well until 3 months ago when he had a recurrence in his lungs. He is bothered by night time pain in his legs and chest. If he forgets a dose of morphine, he notices that he has a dull pain in the chest.\nHe manages a shop out of his home, and his wife works at a local hospital as a health aide. He has two children studying in school. He does not smoke or drink alcohol.\nHe takes morphine 10 mg every 4 h during the day with good results but cannot sleep at night due to pinching, shooting pain in his right stump that starts at 2 am. He has tried increasing his night time dose of morphine and it has not helped.\nHis physical examination is remarkable for:\nWalking with crutches Stump is well healed and without erythema Lung examination is without wheezes."
"A 25-year-old female, suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, since the age of 15 years, was referred by her treating gynecologists at 30th week, for not being cooperative for examination, poor weight gain during pregnancy, and refusal to eat. On examination, the patient was found to have florid positive symptoms in the form of bizarre delusions, persecutory delusions, hallucinatory behavior, negative symptoms, poor self-care, and poor oral intake. She also refused that she was pregnant. Abdominal examination revealed small for gestational age fetus. She was admitted to the inpatient unit, and initially, she was managed with tablet haloperidol, without much benefit. In view of poor oral intake and positive symptoms, she was considered for ECT. Pre-ECT evaluation (as done for the above-described patient) did not reveal any abnormality. Following this, she was treated with ECT, and she received six ECTs during the antenatal period []. With ECT, she showed significant improvement in her psychopathology, started accepting that she was pregnant. About a day after the sixth ECT, she developed uterine contractions; however, labor did not progress, even after waiting for 36 h. Following this, she underwent cesarean section and gave birth to a healthy female baby. However, in the immediate postpartum, she had relapse of symptoms, which led to reinstitution of ECT."
"A 25-year-old young male with paranoid schizophrenia for 3 years, presented to us with a history of uprolling of eyeballs with haloperidol 20 mg/day and without any respite on adding 6 mg of THP. Hence, he was shifted on olanzapine 10 mg in the view of good efficacy and less EPS potential. The dose was hiked from 10 to 20 mg/day after 15 days as the patient had partial improvement. However, within 5–6 days of hiking the dose, he again started reporting repeated episodes of uprolling of eyeballs with upward fixation, each episode lasted for 5–6 min, and continued despite adding oral anticholinergic medication. Naranjo algorithm[] indicated a probability score of 8, which clearly depicts probable association of oculogyric crisis with olanzapine. Thereafter, he was shifted on clozapine. At present, the patient is free from OGC and maintaining well on clozapine 500 mg for the past 5 months."
"A 25-year-old young female with paranoid schizophrenia for 3 years showed partial improvement in psychotic symptoms with olanzapine 10 mg/day, but due to excessive sedation, she was switched on aripiprazole. On aripiprazole 15 mg/day, she reported tremors in hands, change in gait, and rigidity, which were not improved even after adding THP. Later, she was put on amisulpride in the view of its less sedative and metabolic side effects, and the dose was gradually hiked to 300 mg/day, on which she had significant improvement in psychotic symptoms and functionality for nearly 9 months. Thereafter, family members started reporting her poor interaction, irritability, and lesser functionality, so the dose of amisulpride was hiked to 400 mg/day. After 1 month, she started having episodes of uprolling of eyeballs with upward fixation and marked anxiety, which were difficult to bring back to original position by the patient, and each episode lasted for 10–20 min. These episodes improved after discontinuation of amisulpride and switching on risperidone 3 mg and THP 2 mg combination. Naranjo algorithm indicated a probability score of 8, which clearly depicts probable association of oculogyric crisis with amisulpride. Now, the patient is stabilized on risperidone 3 mg and THP 2 mg and free from OGC episodes for the past 1 year."
"A 25-year-old male presented to Mid-Atlantic level 1 trauma center following a motor vehicle accident with complaints of severe neck pain and left-sided weakness of the upper and lower extremities.\nHis neurological examination showed 4 out of 5 strength in his right deltoid, biceps, wrist extensor, triceps, finger flexors, interossei, hip flexors, quadriceps, tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and gastrocnemius muscle groups. His left side, however, yielded 0 out of 5 strength of the previously mentioned muscle groups. He was sensory intact to light touch throughout all distributions tested. Pinprick and pinch testing, however, were diminished throughout his entire right side. Rectal examination demonstrated voluntary contraction and relief of the sphincter. In the perianal region, he was able to discriminate between sharp and dull sensations on the left side, but not the right.\nA computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine showed a C5 burst fracture with significant angulation deformity and retropulsion of fragments posteriorly [Figures –]. T2-weighted MRI at C5 showed a C5 burst fracture with spinal cord signal change at C3–C4 []. Because of the incomplete nature of the spinal cord injury, emergent operative decompression and stabilization followed. Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion from C4 to C6 was performed with structural iliac crest allograft and Depuy Skyline instrumentation. This was followed by C4–C6 posterior cervical fusion with Depuy Mountaineer lateral mass screws and autologous iliac crest bone graft []. On postoperative day number 1, the patient was ambulatory with assistance but still had profound upper extremity weakness. At 3-week follow-up, he was ambulating without an assist device, was writing with his left hand, and had 4 out of 5 strength in all groups tested. He still had persistent sensory changes, an inability to feel sharp pain, and distinguish hot versus cold water. At final follow-up, the patient was 4 out of 5 in strength in his left deltoid and subjectively diminished hot and cold sensation on the right arm as compared to the left arm."
"A 25-year-old man was referred to our hospital for the treatment of recurrent PH and CH. He had undergone T2 and T3 sympathetic ramicotomy for PH 11 years previously. He had developed CH 3 months after ETS and recurrent sweating on the palms 1 year after ETS. Because he had failed to respond to conservative therapy, surgical treatment was considered. Preoperative DITI showed decreased temperature on the palms, anterior chest wall, and abdomen, suggesting recurrent PH and CH.\nSurgery was performed using 5-mm trocars as part of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in the same manner as the first case. Bilateral T4 sympathetic clipping and reconstruction of the sympathetic nerve from a T5 to T8 sympathetic nerve graft was performed. He was discharged on the fourth postoperative day with decreased sweating on the hands and no sweating on the chest, abdomen, and back. Postoperative DITI showed increased temperature on the palms, anterior chest wall, and abdomen, suggesting improvement in hyperhidrosis (). Four months after ETS, there was no recurrent hyperhidrosis."
"A 25-year-old male presented with the complaint of progressively growing mass at the palatal region of 2 years duration. The growing mass was a size of the peanut which progressively increased to the present size []. He did complain of some difficulty in mastication and phonetic articulation but gave no complaints of the loss of sensation of the hard palate or the oral mucosa. His general and physical examination was normal, except for his suffused face. Blood investigations were requested, which rendered normal results. On intraoral examination, a large, well defined lobulated mass was seen on the hard palate. The growth was hard and was fixed to the underlying maxillary bone. The surface of the growth did not bleed on touch, and there was no associated lymphadenopathy. Keeping in mind the gradually progressive nature of the growth and the clinical appearance of the patient, we arrived at a provisional diagnosis of a lepromatous lesion on the hard palate. Incisional biopsy was performed, and a histopathological diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy was confirmed [Figures –]. The patient underwent excisional biopsy under general anesthesia."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a swelling in the anterior maxilla of 1-year duration. There were no associated symptoms and no history of trauma. His medical and family history was noncontributory. Extraoral examination revealed a bulging facial contour on the left side. Intraorally, a 3 × 2 cm enlargement was noted in the maxilla in relation to the left central and lateral incisor extending into the sulcus. There was no apparent change in color of the overlying mucosa []. Palpation divulged a well-defined, firm and nontender swelling. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy, and routine blood investigations yielded values within normal limits.\nA computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a well-delineated isodense mass causing expansion and thinning of the buccal cortical plate and slight palatal expansion. Also noted was diversion and resorption of the roots of the incisors []. Owing to the size of the mass, the lesion was removed in toto and sent for histopathologic examination.\nGross examination revealed a glistening white round mass measuring 2.5 × 2 cm in dimension. Microscopically, the connective tissue stroma showed delicate collagen fibers disposed in a myxoid matrix containing stellate-shaped fibroblasts []. A few nerve fibers and dilated blood vessels engorged with red blood cells were seen in the connective tissue []. At places, a few odontogenic epithelial rests and foci of calcification were present []. Distributed throughout the stroma were abundant mast cells [], and toluidine blue staining was performed for confirmation of the mast cells []. The lesion was signed out as COF, complex type."
"A 25-year-old man presented with severe neck pain without neurologic deficit after a traffic accident. The mental status of the patient was intact after admission. Physical examination showed tenderness and pain on the posterior aspect of the cervical spine. Neurologic examination revealed no deficit of motor power and sensation on all 4 of his extremities. Plain radiographs of the cervical spine revealed the C4 vertebral body slightly displaced anteriorly and increased interspinous space at the level of C4–5, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed a disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament on the level of C4–5 and severe injury to the soft tissues of the cervical spine (Fig. ). The patient underwent a posterior cervical reduction and fusion of C4–5 using pedicle screw fixation and allograft after admission. All pedicle screws were inserted by free-hand technique, that is, the pedicle was inserted according to the anatomical landmarks of cervical spine and self-medical experience without navigation. After creating a pilot hole and confirming no arterial bleeding or cerebrospinal fluid leakage, an appropriate pedicle screw was inserted (Fig. ), C-arm machine was used to confirm the pedicle screw had no obvious deviation. The patient was neurologically intact after wake-up. However, the patient felt weakness and numbness for both of upper and lower extremities (motor power Grade II–III) in the next morning. Computed tomography (CT) scans of C4–5 and MRI of the brain were performed orderly and immediately. The CT scans revealed bilateral occupation of the pedicle screws of the foramen of C4 and C5 (Fig. ) and the MRI displayed several areas of infarction of the brainstem and cerebellum (Fig. ). Given that the symptoms of cerebral infarction may directly be caused by the occupation of bilateral VA, a second surgery was immediately decided to remove all of the pedicle screws and place lateral mass screws instead (Fig. ). The patient felt better on his all of 4 extremities following revision surgery. Fortunately, he was neurologically close to normal at a 3-month follow-up.\nThe ethical committee was waived for this retrospective study. Informed consent was obtained by patient himself."
"AM was a 25-year-old female trader who\ndiscovered that she could no longer close her mouth\nafter yawning a day before presentation. She also had\npain in the preauricular region. This was her first\nexperience of such, and she had no comorbid\nconditions. On examination, it was noticed that she\nhad limitation in mouth opening and closure, her lip\nseal was incompetent and there was bilateral tenderness\nin the preauricular regions. TMJ movement\ntransmission was not detected bilaterally. Radiologic\ninvestigations revealed an anterior displacement of the\ncondylar head beyond the articular eminence. No other\nabnormality was seen. Patient had Hippocrates\nmanouvre done to reposition the head of the condyle\nback in the glenoid fossa and this was successful. Barrel\nbandage was applied to immobilize the joint. The\noutcome as at two (2) days post reduction was a\nsuccessful restoration of TMJ movement"
"A 25-year-old male presented with a 2-day history of sudden painless loss of vision in the right eye. On examination, the VA was 6/60 OD, and he was noted to have a central subhyaloid and sub-ILM hemorrhage which resolved after 3 months without treatment. His vision at discharge was 6/5 OD."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with fever with left-sided chest pain for 2 months. Fever was intermittent, low grade with evening rise of temperature. Chest pain was dull aching and pleuritic in nature. The patient had dry cough on and off along with complaints of weight loss, malaise, and lethargy. The patient was treated for these complaints outside by antibiotics and symptomatic treatment, but his symptoms persisted.\nOn examination, the patient was moderately built, nourished, conscious, oriented, hemodynamically stable, and maintaining 97% SpO2 on room air. Chest examination revealed coarse crackles in the left infrascapular area. His cardiovascular and neurological examination was unremarkable. His complete blood count [] showed anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia with blood picture showing dimorphic, macrocytic anemia. The liver and kidney functions were within normal limits. On further investigation, the patient was found to be HIV reactive. Chest X-ray revealed nonhomogeneous opacity with cavitation in the left upper and middle zone [] suggestive of tuberculosis. Sputum examination could not be done as patient was not expectorating. The patient was not on any drugs that could lead to thrombocytopenia. The patient was transfused blood and multiple units of platelets and were started on isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated 2 weeks after starting antitubercular treatment (ATT). Patient's hematological parameters slowly improved after blood product transfusions and starting appropriate chemotherapy. With recovery of the platelet counts, the patient was discharged on ATT and HAART and was asked to follow-up in the outpatient department."
"A 25-year-old male presented with visual decline following closed globe injury left eye, sustained 2 weeks ago, due to a firecracker-related accident. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 and 20/120 in the right and the left eye, respectively. Examination of anterior segment of both eyes and fundus right eye was unremarkable. Fundus examination of the left eye revealed an FTMH and horizontally oval area of subretinal hemorrhage underlying the macular hole and extending temporally []. A temporal circumferential choroidal rupture was also noted 1-disc diameters (DD) away from macular hole. Retinal periphery was normal. Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) (DRI, Triton Topcon Inc.,) revealed least hole diameter of 656 μ and submacular hemorrhage []. Dispersed vitreous hemorrhage was noted inferiorly.\nAfter informed consent, the patient underwent standard 3-port 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy under peribulbar anesthesia. Following core vitrectomy, posterior vitreous detachment was induced using Triamcinolone Acetonide crystals (Aurocort™, Aurolab, Madurai, India). Fluid air exchange was done, and 50 microgram (in 0.05 ml) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (Alteplase, Actilyse™, Zydus Cadila, German Remedies, India) was injected into the subretinal space, through the FTMH, using a soft tip cannula. This resulted in shallow retinal detachment at the macula and few clots of hemorrhage evacuated into the vitreous cavity []. After 5 min, air was replaced with fluid, and internal limiting membrane (ILM) was peeled after staining with 0.05% brilliant blue G dye (Ocublue Plus™, Aurolab, Madurai, India), using pinch and peel technique with Eckardt type disposable ILM forceps []. A large peel of around 2 DDs was performed. After completion of ILM peeling, subretinal hemorrhage was aspirated through the macular hole using soft-tip canula in passive suction mode [Fig. and ]. Any touch with RPE was avoided, and no attempts were made to aspirate blood outside the macula. A repeat fluid air exchange was done, and air was replaced with 25% sulfur hexafluoride. The patient was advised routine postoperative medication and prone position for 72 h.\nAt 1-week follow-up, BCVA in the left eye improved to 20/80 with Type I closure of the macular hole [Fig. and ]. Ellipsoid zone (EZ) and external limiting membrane (ELM) were discontinuous as seen on SS-OCT. At three months, BCVA improved to 20/30, and EZ and ELM were restored on SS-OCT [Fig. and ]. The patient was advised regular follow-up."
"A 25-year-old uniparous woman, presented with 1-month history of first episode of painful spontaneous bruises all over the body. There was no personal or family history of bleeding disorders. There was no history of trauma or significant drug history. Her medical history revealed recurrent depressive mood for which she had not received any treatment. She also complained of headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed multiple, irregularly shaped, tender ecchymoses of varying sizes over bilateral upper limbs and legs, forehead, neck, and right retroauricular areas. Autoerythrocyte sensitization test was positive. Routine laboratory parameters were normal; however, low hemoglobin (6.4 g/dl), altered iron profile (ferritin-4.3 ng/ml, Serum iron– 20 μg/dl, TIBC – 385 μg/dl) and a very high ESR (122 mm/1st h) was noted. Peripheral smear showed moderate anisopoikilocytosis and microcytic hypochromic anemia with a few elliptocytes and pencil cells. Transferrin saturation index was 5.1. Bone marrow examination showed ineffective erythropoiesis suggestive of iron deficiency anemia."
"A 25-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department complaining of left hip pain and difficulty walking since 3 days. She was diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome about 2 months ago and was taking prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy. She gave no history of trauma or surgery. On examination, she was afebrile with normal vitals. Her neurological examination was normal and her lower limb examination revealed mild tenderness over the left gluteal region; however, deep tendon reflexes and power were within the normal limits. Laboratory examination showed normal blood cell counts. Her CD4+ T-cell count was 300 (within normal limits). She was referred to Department of Radio-diagnosis for plain radiograph of pelvis, which did not reveal any significant abnormality. She was subsequently discharged with a prescription of antiinflammatory drugs.\nShe returned a week later with the same complaints. On examination, she was tachycardic and febrile with a body temperature of 38.2°C. Her lower examination revealed pain on flexion and extension of left hip joint. The lower limb pulses were within the normal limits.\nShe was then referred to Radio-diagnosis Department. Since her plain radiographs were within the normal limits in the initial visit, she was investigated with a CT scan of the lower abdomen. Multiple air locules were noted in the left iliac blade and acetabulum with multiple ill-defined hypodense areas in periarticular muscles of left hip joint with surrounding fat stranding [Figure –]. A possibility of emphysematous osteomyelitis was considered and she was subjected for a fine needle aspiration cytology, a specimen of which was also sent for culture and sensitivity tests. She was empirically started on metronidazole and piperacillin. Her gram stain revealed gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria. Culture and sensitivity revealed growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to piperacillin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. She was put on piperacillin and tazobactam, and metronidazole was discontinued. No complications were noted on follow-up."
"A 25-year-old male who presented with bilioptysis in the Department of Surgical Gastroenterology was referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine for cholescintigraphy. He gave a history of jaundice, for which he was diagnosed as a case of hydatid cyst with choledocholithiasis. He was initially managed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), common bile duct (CBD) clearance, and stenting of the bile duct elsewhere. He developed recurrent cholangitis due to stent block and later was managed surgically with open choledochotomy and extraction of hydatid cyst and T-tube drainage in other hospital. However, the stent was not removed. The patient remained asymptomatic for 4 years. Later, he developed recurrent episodes of fever and cough which was bile stained and was referred to our Center for Management. On examination, he had good body built and good performance status. Chest examination revealed crepitations in the right basal area. Abdominal examination was unremarkable except that a healed scar mark of the previous surgery. He was referred for hepatobiliary scintigraphy in view of high suspicion of BBF. Dynamic [] and static [] hepatobiliary scintigraphy by 185 MBq technetium-99m N-(3-bromo-2,4,6-trimethylacetanilide)iminodiacetic acid (99mTc-mebrofenin) and SPECT depicted tracer accumulation in the right lung []. Contrast-enhanced CT thorax and abdomen revealed misplaced stent with coiled tip in the right subdiaphragmatic region with small collection along in vicinity of the coiled stent tip, suggestive of pus. A linear defect in mid-portion of the right dome of the diaphragm was also noticed along with peripheral bronchus of anterolateral segment of the right lower lobe of the lung. Multiple calculi were also noted in the gallbladder. He was taken up for surgery and underwent dismantling of the biliobronchial fistula, closure of the diaphragmatic rent, open cholecystectomy, CBD excision, and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Operative picture [] reveals rent in the diaphragm. Operative specimen [] reveals displaced stent with granulation tissue. Postoperative course was uneventful. After 2½ years of follow-up, he is asymptomatic."
"A 25-year-old male Syrian refugee presented in our hospital with right-sided recurrent hip infections after hip arthroplasty which he had received in Turkey after being injured by shell splinters and gun shots during combats in the Syrian civil war. Following his treatment in Turkey, the patient had managed to undertake the wearing journey to Germany, and he got lodged in a refugee accommodation in Munich. At our institution, the patient underwent hip arthroplasty revision with implantation of an antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer in terms of a girdlestone arthroplasty. Microbiologically, an infection of the hip joint with gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and anaerobes (Solobacterium soolei, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides vulgatus) was detected. Because of this suspicious spectrum of bacteria, a CT-scan (Fig. a) with rectal contrast media (red arrow) was performed and did reveal a recto-acetabular fistula (white arrows). As a consequence, the patient underwent loop ileostomy formation to control the feculent fistulous discharge. Consecutively, the fistula was successfully closed by endoscopic over-the-scope clipping (OTSC®, clip 14/6 t, Ovesco, Tübingen, Germany; Fig. b and c). After three months, the stoma could be successfully reversed after endoscopic and radiological control had been found to be without any signs of recurrent fistula, rectal stenosis or necrosis. The clip had been found to be still in situ. Afterwards, definitive hip arthroplasty was performed after negative microbiological test results. Consecutively, the patient successfully underwent rehabilitation measures."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented to the outpatient department with a skin condition present since birth. Being initially smaller in size and localized, the distribution widened during puberty to the present pattern. The patterned lesion was clinically characterized by linearly arranged, grouped acuminate papules with central dark pigmented, keratotic plugs resembling comedones, but much bigger in size. It extended from left anterior chest to left upper back, and included the left axilla and left arm outer aspect. He had recurrent abscesses at multiple locations in the region of the nevus. His symptoms were particularly severe in the left axilla, which was his main complaint [Figures and ]. He had no family history of similar complaints. He had visited numerous dermatologists for the same, but their treatment, from keratolytics to lasers, was of no avail.\nThe rest of the cutaneous examination was found to be normal.\nGeneral physical examination and systemic examination were unremarkable. Special attention was given to ophthalmological, skeletal, and neurological examinations, to rule out NC syndrome, and these too were normal.\nAfter detailed preop workup, he underwent wide local excision of the left axilla skin and subcutaneous fat, down to the level of deep fascia. The resulting defect was resurfaced with a transposition flap from left posterior trunk, and the donor site was skin grafted [Figures , and ]. The surgical procedure was well tolerated and the flap remained fully viable on follow-up. The excised specimen was sent for a detailed histopathological assessment, which confirmed the diagnosis of NC.\nAfter a 4-month interval, he was taken up for surgery again, wherein he underwent excision of the remaining areas of NC. The anterior chest wall region was then closed primarily, while the posterior and lower axillary chest wall region was covered with a split-thickness skin graft harvested from the thigh []. Once again, he tolerated the procedure well, with the skin graft taking up completely. He was given compression garments and taught to massage the scar at frequent intervals, to optimize scar appearance. However, despite his compliance being suboptimal, his skin-grafted areas and axillary flap settled down well, and he is doing well on long-term follow-up of 2 years [Figures , and ]."
"A 25-year-old female presented to us with 1-week history of fever, malar rash, cough, streaky hemoptysis, and worsening breathlessness. Her history was significant for an intrauterine death 8 months back due to severe preeclampsia with positive anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL IgG = 60 GPL units) and then with no further evaluation following the pregnancy. Examination revealed hypertension, multiple petechiae, nonscarring alopecia, bilateral lung crepitations, and wheeze. Her blood picture showed normocytic normochromic anemia with normal reticulocyte count and normal bilirubin, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. She had 2.7 g proteinuria with an active urinary sediment and serum creatinine of 2 mg/dl []. Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates with computed tomography chest showing evidence of multiple areas of consolidation in both lung fields. Sputum culture grew Klebsiella. Antinuclear antibody was positive with anti-Sjögren Syndrome A, anti-ribonucleoproteins, and anti-ribosomal P being positive on immunoblot. Serum complement levels were low. Her activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was abnormal (patient 126 s, control 28 s) with a normal prothrombin time.\nA diagnosis of SLE with APS was made with cutaneous, hematologic and renal involvement. At the time of diagnosis, the patient was suffering with bronchopneumonia. The patient was started on methyl prednisolone pulse (1 g/day for 3 days) followed by 1 mg/kg prednisolone along with appropriate antibiotics and antihypertensives (amlodipine, furosemide, prazosin extended release). She was planned for plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin if clinical condition worsened. Her blood counts improved, creatinine normalized, and lung infiltrates recovered in the next 1 week. Telmisartan was added. A renal biopsy was done after her platelet count rose and APPT normalized. Renal biopsy showed enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli with increase in mesangial and endocapillary cellularity [], neutrophilic infiltration, and mesangiolysis []. Intracapillary fibrin thrombi [], ischemic wrinkling of a glomerulus with mild tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis were also noted with one small artery showing intimal endothelial cell swelling and near-total luminal occlusion. The pathological diagnosis was consistent with Class IV lupus nephritis with APS nephropathy. Based on this biopsy report, besides steroids, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin were also added. Three months after starting her treatment, the patient is in complete remission."
"A 25-year-old lady presented with a history of right side upper abdominal pain for 3 months, which was accompanied with progressive weight loss ~ approximately 10 kg during this period. There was no history suggestive of any adrenal dysfunction or family history related to familial syndromes. On physical examination, she was normotensive and functional workup for adrenal gland was also within normal limits. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen revealed a large heterogeneous mass in right adrenal measuring 20 cm × 15 cm with few cystic areas, fat content, and calcifications []. Hence, a differential diagnosis of adrenal myelolipoma (in view of fat contents) and malignancy (in view of large heterogeneous mass) was considered. Surgical resection was planned. Intraoperatively, the tumor was extending in the retrocaval area just below the liver and was difficult to mobilize. Right adrenalectomy was performed successfully []. The postoperative period was uneventful, and she was discharged on 6th postoperative day.\nThe specimen was sent for histopathological examination. On gross examination, the specimen measured ~ 19 cm × 15 cm. The outer surface was bosselated and congested. The cut surface showed a mass with a variegated appearance. The mass was solid and cystic in nature with predominance of adipose tissue []. Further, sectioning was difficult due to areas of marked calcification. Normal adrenal was not identified grossly.\nOn microscopic examination, a tumor was identified which was composed of ectodermal, endodermal, and mesenchymal elements characterized by presence of multiple cysts lined with squamous cells, and ciliated columnar epithelial cells, glands, cartilage, bone, bone marrow, muscles as well as large areas of glial tissue. Some normal adrenal gland tissue was also observed at the periphery in the form of nodule composed of cells with clear cytoplasm. No immature component was seen. Hence, the final diagnosis was given as primary mature adrenal teratoma []."
"A 25-year-old man presented to our institution with a 1-year history of progressive dyspnea with exertion. He had received multiple courses of radiation 9 years before our evaluation for a spinal tumor. He had multiple hospitalizations throughout the year for bronchopneumonia and bronchial asthma exacerbations. He had no family history of premature CAD. On echocardiography, a mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with estimated EF of 40% was identified as well as moderate aortic insufficiency with severe calcification of the aortic and mitral valves. Cardiac catheterization revealed 99% stenosis of the left main coronary artery []. The patient underwent coronary bypass grafting, but unfortunately died due to intraoperative complications."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian normotensive woman was admitted to the emergency department in June 2015 due to malaise, fatigue, myalgias, cramps, left hemiface and left upper arm paraesthesias. Head CT excluded intracranial lesions and blood tests revealed a low serum K+ of 2.9 mEq/L. She was referred to the Endocrinology clinic for evaluation of persistent hypokalaemia. She denied diarrhoea, abuse of diuretics, laxatives or ‘natural supplements’. Concerning her family history, she has no siblings, her parents are non-consanguineous and healthy. Physical examination revealed depressed humour, normal body mass index (22 kg/m2), blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, pulse rate 82 bpm, no stigmata of hypercortisolism and no focal neurological signs."
"A 25-year-old male presented in the outpatient department requesting for left ear lobule deformity correction for cosmetic reasons. He had no other functional difficulties including hearing on both sides. There was no positive family history and no significant drug intake by his mother during the conception period as elicited from the history.\nOn local examination, there was a wavy deformity [] of the lobule in the part that attaches the ear to the side of the face. Rest of the ear was normal. The surgical planning [] was done. Local flaps raised, hillock remnant excised and correction achieved. The post-operative appearance is as shown in ."
"In March 2019, a 25-year-old nonsmoking female was admitted to the hospital complaining of cough and severe dyspnea. A chest CT scan showed right pleural effusion with bottom pleural thickening and subtotal atelectasis of the right lung associated with multiple mediastinal nodal involvement (Fig. ). Transthoracic ultrasound and medical pleuroscopy findings were mirror-like to chest CT scan imaging (Fig. ).\nExudative citrine yellow fluid was drained by ultrasound-guided thoracentesis, and diagnosis of ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma was obtained on pleural fluid and confirmed on pleuroscopic pleural biopsies (Fig. ). Total body positron emission tomography with 18FDG confirmed a clinical stage IVA (cT3N2M1a, TNM version 8.0).\nThe chemotherapy with alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was performed, and the respiratory symptoms disappeared within 3 weeks. In 3 months, chest CT scan showed dramatic improvement of primary tumor with complete remission 15 months later (Fig. )."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with progressive blurring of vision in the left eye of two months duration. There was no history of any systemic illness or previous ocular trauma. Ocular examination revealed a best corrected VA of 20/20 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. The pupillary reactions as well as the slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment were normal in both the eyes. The posterior segment findings included bilateral, multiple, grayish, subretinal, linear branching streaks extending centrifugally from the peripapillary area and multiple areas of ""Peau d′orange"" pigmentary changes in the temporal midperipheral fundus. In the left eye one of these streaks passed through the fovea and was associated with a small, grayish, subfoveal lesion with a surrounding bleed .\nFundus fluorescein angiography showed transmission hyperfluorescence corresponding to the linear streaks and an area of expanding hyperfluorescence, with late leakage in the subfoveal location in the left eye . Optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed the presence of a subfoveal CNVM with a central retinal thickness (CRT) of 392 microns in the left eye .\nA detailed systemic workup revealed the presence of multiple hyperpigmented papules on the back of the neck with a highly elastic skin, suggestive of pseudoxanthoma elasticum.\nAfter an informed consent, 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin TM , Genetech INA, California, USA) was injected in the left eye under aseptic conditions. Post-injection, her best corrected visual acuity improved to 20/30 and the CRT on OCT reduced to 331 microns at one week and to 211 microns at six weeks. Fundus fluorescein angiogram confirmed reduction in leakage .\nA second dose of intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg) was repeated six weeks after the first injection. Two weeks after the second dose, her best corrected visual acuity improved to 20/20. Fluorescein angiogram confirmed total absence of any leakage with CRT of 190 microns on OCT ."
"A 25-year-old systemically healthy male patient presented\nwith complaints of severe photophobia, redness, discharge,\npain and severe swelling of the lids in the left eye, since two\ndays.\nPast history was significant for a boil on the lower\neyelid, two days ago. On examination, the best-corrected\nvisual acuity was 20/20 and 20/30, in the right and left eyes\nrespectively. Right eye examination was unremarkable. The\nleft eye showed severe lid edema with scales on the skin and\nassociated kerato-conjunctivitis []. The cornea showed\nmultiple marginal infiltrates. Photographic documentation\nof the anterior segment condition was impossible because of\nthe severe photophobia. Extraocular movements were full.\nA conjunctival swab and a periorbital skin swab were sent\nfor culture and sensitivity. The corneal infiltrates were also\ncultured on blood agar and Sabouraud′s dextrose agar. The\npatient was seen by our infectious diseases expert and started\non intravenous co-amoxiclav (Augmentin, GlaxoSmithKline)\n1 g twice daily, intravenous ceftriaxone (ceftriaxone sodium,\nSandoz, Novartis) 1 g twice daily and oral metronidazole\n(Flagyl, Searle) 500 mg three times daily, pending sensitivity\nreports. Topical loteprednol etabonate (0.5%) (Alrex eye drops,\nBausch and Lomb Incorporated) every three hourly and\nciprofloxacin (0.3%) (Ciplox eye drops, Cipla) six times a day\nwere started, in the left eye.\nOn follow-up two days later, the patient was symptomatically\nmuch better. The skin scabs had fallen off, revealing violaceous,\nsub-epidermal necrosis. The conjunctival inflammation had\nreduced and the corneal marginal infiltrates had almost\ndisappeared []. Culture and sensitivity results showed\nStaphylococcus aureus, sensitive to the administered medications.\nThe culture plates for corneal infiltrates showed negative\ngrowth and were discarded after three weeks. The patient was\nsero-negative for HIV.\nFive days later, the skin lesions had healed and the\nconjunctivitis had resolved. Intravenous antibiotics were\nstopped and the patient was started on oral co-amoxiclav\n(Augmentin, GlaxoSmithKline), 625 mg thrice a day, for a\nweek.\nOn final follow-up a month later, periocular skin discoloration\nwas the only sequalae noted []."
"A 25-yr-old female patient visited the habitual abortion clinic in Hanyang University Hospital because of her history of recurrent abortions. She had been pregnant 3 times and all pregnancies were resulted in spontaneous abortions during 8-10 weeks of gestation. All of the 30 metaphases analyzed showed karyotype of 47,XX,-11,+fis(11)(p10),+fis(11)(q10) (). Both arms of the broken chromosome 11 appeared to be telocentric chromosomes. Chromosome studies on all her family members (father, mother and a younger brother) revealed normal karyotypes.\nSix months later, she became pregnant. A prenatal cytogenetic test was performed by chorionic villus sampling at 10th week of pregnancy. The fetus had normal female karyotype, 46,XX, and she delivered a healthy female baby. The karyotype of the baby was reconfirmed by peripheral blood chromosome analysis.\nChromosome analysis of 72 hr lymphocyte cultures was performed with conventional GTG-banding techniques. To confirm the chromosome aberration of fis (), primed in situ labeling (PRINS) with the oligonucleotide primer specific for centromere of chromosome 11 () and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting probe for chromosome 11 (Chromoprobe TM-M11, Cytocell, Cambridge, U.K.) were studied. In all the metaphases scored (more than 30), 47 chromosomes were found. Chromosome 11 was divided into one smaller and one larger telocentric chromosome (). FISH analyses showed that no other chromosomes were involved (). It was evident that both fragments possessed centromeric heterochromatins in different amounts of the FISH positive band, i.e. the telocentric 11p has much larger centromeric heterochromatin than that of the telocentric 11q (). Centric fission of chromosome 11 has resulted in two stable telocentrics. There was no tendency to fuse again or to associate with acrocentrics as verified in 50 additional metaphases. Three distinct fluorescent spots were detected with the PRINS reaction in more than 100 interphase nuclei."
"A 25-yr-old female was admitted to our hospital with complaints of weakness and dizziness of one week's duration. She also complained of fever, vague abdominal pain, and dark colored urine. She did not have any significant prior medical history and there was no recent drug exposure. The initial blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, the pulse rate was 100/min, and the body temperature was 38℃. There was neither palpable abdominal mass nor other specific findings on the physical examination except for her pale appearance.\nAt the time of admission her hemoglobin level was 4.2 g/dL, and the reticulocyte count was 23.5% (corrected count: 5.74%). Marked polychromasia with spherocytosis and nucleated red blood cells were noted on the peripheral blood smear. The serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 1,842 IU/L (240-460 IU/L), total bilirubin, 2.73 mg/dL (0.4-1.3 mg/dL), haptoglobin, 38 mg/dL (70-380 mg/dL), and vitamin B12, 369 pg/mL (225-1,100 pg/mL). The blood group was A, Rh-positive. The direct and indirect antiglobulin tests were all positive. Serum autoantibody testing against red blood cells was positive, and anti-nuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody tests were negative. The abdominal computed tomography revealed a huge left ovarian cystic mass and hepatosplenomegaly ().\nWe started to treat her with prednisolone, 1.5 mg/kg/day. However the hemoglobin level gradually decreased to 3.3 g/dL, and she complained of resting chest discomfort 2 days after prednisolone. We performed transfusion with packed red blood cell in spite of the positive cross matching, and the persistent autoantibody. We stopped treating her with prednisolone after 7 days, and then resected the ovarian tumor. The tumor was 13×9×7 cm sized, well encapsulated mass and the mass was cystic and multiloculated. The cystic content was greasy, and composed of keratin, sebum, and hairs. Teeth were also present. Microscopically, the cyst was lined by mature epidermis with skin appendages, neural tissue and adipocyte (). After surgical resection of the teratoma, the hemoglobin level stopped decreasing, and it then gradually increased (). She was diagnosed as having AIHA induced by an ovarian teratoma. She did not have any evidence of hemolysis and anemia, but the direct antiglobulin test was still positive 4 months after the surgery."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a painless mass in the medial canthal area of the left eye. The mass had been present for 20 years (). An examination revealed a hard, non-tender, movable mass measuring about 1 cm located just inferior to the left medial canthal tendon (MCT). The size of the mass didn't change when the patient's position changed or when a Valsalva maneuver was performed. Best corrected visual acuity of the left eye was 1.0 and the anterior segment was normal. There was no epiphora, the height of the tear meniscus was normal, and irrigation of the lacrimal system revealed no abnormalities. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbit showed that a cystic lesion was lying just anterior to the lacrimal drainage system ().\nThe mass was suspected to be a dermoid and excision was performed. It proved to be a yellow, well-demarcated tumor that was adherent to the MCT and periosteum. The mass was dissected from the MCT and periosteum, but during subsequent dissection, it was impossible to dissect the posterior surface of the mass whilst maintaining visibility because of a deep, narrow surgical field. After completing the dissection of the posterior surface of the mass from surrounding tissues, lacerations of both the upper and lower canaliculus were found near the common canaliculus. Both cut ends of the canaliculi were sutured after a bicanalicular silicone tube had been placed. There was some epiphora immediately after surgery, but this resolved 1 month later. The silicone tube was removed at 6 months after surgery."
"A 25-yr-old nulliparous woman with unremarkable past medical history and no significant prenatal risk factor was referred to our department at 19 weeks' gestation for level II ultrasound examination, which revealed a fluid-filled structure in the thoracic cavity. Her previous medical history revealed that she had menarche at 16 yr of age and regular menstrual cycle before conceiving. She had a routine antenatal care. Maternal serum triple marker test was negative, showing 1.191 MoM (48.63 ng/mL) of α-FP, 0.368 MoM (14.37 IU/mL) of hCG, and 0.789 MoM (1.47 ng/mL) of uE3.\nOn ultrasonography a single fetus was present and fetal biometry was consistent with the patient's dates. Transabdominal ultrasonography showed a fluid-filled stomach in the left thorax with the heart displaced to the right in the axial scan (). Sagittal scan showed a defect in the left posterolateral diaphragm with herniation of stomach (). There was no associated anomaly in central nervous system, heart, both kidneys and extremities in ultrasonography. Neither polyhydramnios nor oligohydramnios was found. In order to rule out chromosomal abnormalities, we performed a cordocentesis at 20 weeks' gestation. Chromosome analysis was performed using the GTG band method (G-banding by the Trypsin-Giemsa technique). Fetal karyotype is 46,XY/46,X,-Y,+der(Y)t(Y;1)(q12;q12) ().\nThe couple was informed of the diagnosis and decided to have a termination of pregnancy at 21 weeks' gestation. A male fetus weighing 180 g was delivered vaginally. An autopsy after delivery demonstrated an isolated CDH of Bochdalek (). Her non-consanguineous husband was 29-yr old. Paternal karyotyping was done to assess whether the Y-autosomal translocation is transmitted from father, which subsequently revealed normal karyotype, 46, XY. Maternal karyotype was also normal."
"A 25-year-old woman with poor vision in her left eye since early childhood and high myopia in her right eye (refractive error; -11 D) presented with a history of sudden deterioration of vision in her left eye for two days. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable.\nFull ocular examination was performed. The best corrective visual acuity of her right eye was 20/20 with correction of -11 D, while that of her left eye was hand motion with correction of -19.75 D. Intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg in the right eye and 17 mmHg in the left eye. Slit lamp examination showed clear corneas in both eyes, with diameters of 13.5 mm in the right eye and 10 mm in the left eye. The left eye also had a coloboma of the iris, which manifested as a small notch in the inferonasal pupillary margin () and shallow chamber depth. Keratometry and A-scan ultrasonography were performed. Upon A-scan ultrasonography, axial length was 28.16 mm in the right eye and 29.65 mm in the left eye. Anterior chamber depth was 3.75 mm in the right eye and 2.34 mm in the left eye. Upon keratometry, correction was 43.38 D in the right eye and 40.0 D in the left eye. Fundus examination of the right eye showed a myopic tigroid fundus with tilted disc and peripapillary atrophy. Fundus examination of the left eye showed an inferior choroidal coloboma for about six disc areas, extending to the optic disc, macula and above the temporal arcade. Total bullous detachment of the retina was also observed, including detachment of the macula and the other areas of the retina. Findings suspicious for retinal break were visible in the inferotemporal margin of the choroidal coloboma ().\nThe patient subsequently underwent repair of the retinal detachment. Standard three-port of the pars plana vitrectomy was initially performed with sclerotomy sites 2.5 mm posterior to the limbus. By using the operating microscope, fluid-air exchange was performed with a tapered needle placed over the ecstatic abnormality of the colobomatous zone. A retinal break was noted due to the subretinal viscous fluid passing through the break. The retina was gradually flattened by evacuating subretinal fluid through the retinal break. An endolaser was applied over the flattened retina around the colobomatous area by diode laser. To achieve internal tamponade, 5,000-centistoke silicone oil was then injected into the vitreous cavity. The patient was encouraged to maintain a face-down position for two weeks.\nAt a six-month follow-up period, the patient had visual acuity of hand motion, and the retina remained attached."
"A 25-year-old man presented with increased IOP in the right eye. The patient had cataract extraction and an IOL implantation due to posterior subcapsular cataract one year ago. Subsequently, the eye underwent PPV with encircling buckling due to retinal detachment. The IOP was uncontrollable with MTMT after surgery. SLT had been repeated twice with at an interval of 1 month, but the effect was temporary. IOP was 32 mmHg at one month after the second SLT procedure, and the BCVA was 20/20. Slit lamp findings revealed normal open-angle on gonioscopy, and the C/D ratio was 0.6 with concentric cup enlargement. Limbus-based trabeculectomy was performed. During the surgery, the surgeon (JC) found that there was severe adhesion between the scleral buckle and overlying conjunctiva behind the conjunctival incision line. IOP measured at postoperative 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months was 11, 10, 14, 12, and 14 mmHg, respectively. A localized avascular bleb with moderate elevation was noted, but no serious postoperative complications were noted. The final BCVA was 20/20. No additional IOP-lowering medication was required ()."
"A 25-year-old woman developed intermittent left chest wall pain over a 4 month period. She suffered speaking induced dyspnea. She had no prior history of smoking or asbestos exposure. She had no known underlying systemic disease.\nRadiologic studies included a posteroanterior and lateral chest radiograph, ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT) and whole body bone scan (WBBS). The posteroanterior and lateral chest radiograph revealed a round mass lesion in the left anterior chest (). Sonography showed a well defined, oval shaped, hypoechoic mass involving a rib, which measured 4.2×1.9×4.5 cm (). CT demonstrated the presence of a relatively well defined, ovoid shaped mass at the anterior chest wall. Bony infiltration was suggestive of the tumor having a malignant nature. The mass showed heterogeneous weak enhancement (). The interface between the mass and the lung was smooth, and compression of the lung was observed. There was no mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Neither lung showed evidence of hematogenous or lymphangitic metastasis. The WBBS revealed markedly increased bony uptake with a central photon defect of the left 3rd anterior rib (). No other abnormal, significantly increased bony uptake was noted in the whole skeleton.\nResection of the left 3rd rib, partial resection of the left 2nd and 4th ribs, and chest wall reconstruction with Marlar mesh was done. The gross specimen showed a multilobulated pinkish-white solid mass which adhered to and infiltrated the inner surface of the rib (). One segment of the mass situated within the bony defect (). Histopathology showed a storiform arrangement of malignant cells, including a plump cytoplasm and a few mitotic figures, which was suggestive of storiform-pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma ()."
"A 25-year-old male presented with blurred vision in his left eye that had persisted for 5 days. He also complained of eyeball pain. He had no relevant general medical or ocular history, and took no medication. His best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in right eye was 1.0 and that of the left eye was finger count 50 cm. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 12 mmHg in the right eye and 2mmHg in the left eye. Slit lamp examination showed cells 3+ in the left anterior chamber, posterior synechiae and posterior capsular opacity in the left eye. Fundus examination () demonstrated shallow retinal detachment and choroidal folding in the left eye. No retinal breaks were found. Ultrasound examination () revealed thickened sclera and choroidal detachment in the left eye. Fluorescein angiogram and indocyanine green (ICG) showed diffuse hyperfluorescence in the choroid that appeared in the early phase (10 seconds) and had almost disappeared in the late phase.\nAdministration of high-dose oral steroid and NSAID was not effective, therefore, high-dose intravenous steroid was administered. Subsequent IOP was 1 mmHg in the left eye and slit lamp examination showed cells 3+ in the left anterior chamber. No improvement was noted in the fundus examination. To correct the IOP, 0.7 cc 100% SF6 gas was injected into the vitreous; however the postoperative IOP remained 1 mmHg. Surgical treatment was therefore performed on the left eye under general anesthesia.\nSubscleral sclerectomy was performed at two sites in the temporoinferior and nasoinferior quadrants. A half thickness scleral flap measuring 4×4 mm was made 8 mm from the limbus. Under the scleral flap, the remaining thickness of the sclera was excised in pieces measuring 2×2 mm, thereby exposing the choroid. The scleral flap was loosely sutured and C3F8 gas was injected into the vitreous. At postoperative 1 week, IOP in the left eye was 46 mmHg, and Diamox®, Cosopt®, Alphagan® and Xalatan® were administered. One week later the IOP in the left eye was 17 mmHg. At postoperative 2 months, fundus examination () revealed an attached retina and near complete resolution of the choroidal detachment. Five months after surgery, IOP was 11 mmHg and BCVA was 0.1 in the left eye. No surgery-related side effects were noted and cataract surgery was considered to improve visual acuity."
"A 25-year-old female presented to us with a history of painless, progressive dysphagia to both solid and liquid food for the past 4 years. Initially, she was evaluated elsewhere where barium swallow and oesophagal manometry were suggestive of achalasia cardia. She had undergone an LHM with posterior fundoplication. Post-LHM, she did not have significant relief.\nShe was reassessed at another centre and was found to have insufficient myotomy. Hence, they performed re-do LHM with the extension of myotomy. She had partial relief of symptoms for 3 months, but thereafter had a relapse of dysphagia. Her symptoms of dysphagia and intermittent episodes of vomiting persisted and progressed over 2½ years before she was referred to us for further management.\nAt the time of evaluation, her body mass index was 21 kg/m2. She was investigated with a barium swallow, a computed tomography (CT) thorax and an endoscopy. The barium study revealed a markedly dilated oesophagus with delayed emptying and axis deviation []. Endoscopy confirmed a fluid-filled mega-oesophagus with patent previous myotomy site. CT scan reinforced findings of mega-oesophagus (5 cm) with a deviation of axis []. Manometry was suggestive of aperistaltic oesophageal body. In view of persisting dysphagia even after two attempts at myotomy, dilated oesophagus with axis deviation and the absence of oesophagal peristalsis, we decided to proceed with oesophageal resection and gastric pull-up after discussing with the patient.\nThoracoscopic oesophagectomy was performed in prone position []. Oesophagus was found dilated with the thickened wall with increased vascularity. Thoracoscopy permitted safe dissection to tackle the peri-oesophageal adhesions and increased vascularity. The total operative time was ~330 min with ~100 ml of blood loss.\nThe abdominal procedure was performed by a limited upper midline incision. The cervical oesophagus was mobilised and divided through left neck incision. Gastric pull-up with end-to-side cervical oesophagogastric anastomosis was done in a single layer, with interrupted polyglactin 3-0 sutures. Resected specimen showed dilated oesophagus throughout its extent [].\nShe had an uneventful post-operative course. Feeding through jejunostomy placed intra-operatively was started on the 2nd post-operative day (POD). She was allowed orally on 5th POD after getting an oral contrast study which showed no evidence of leak. She was discharged on the 8th POD.\nHistopathology of the resected specimen was consistent with achalasia, revealing marked hypertrophy of the muscularis propria, and an absence of ganglion cells in myenteric plexus of Auerbach's. At 3 months of follow-up, her oral intake is good with the improved quality of life."
"We report the case of 25 year old woman with a 7 year history of an increasingly painful thigh lump. Pain was triggered after gentle touch of the lateral side of her right thigh across iliotibial band and felt like an electric shock through her femur. On physical examination the thigh was found normal in shape compared with the other side. Overlying skin had normal appearance and mobility. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was found.\nRadiographs of the involved area were non-significant, apart from the one taken 9 months prior to consultation, where a soft tissue lesion with peripheral and central calcification, without osseous continuity was evident (). This was confirmed on computed tomography scan (). Ultrasound scan of the mass revealed the lack of continuity with neighbouring structures and a homogenous, decreased echoic texture.\nAn MRI scan of the right hip followed; the lump demonstrated intermediate signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2, with marked enhancement after iv administration of Gadolinium (). A three phase Tc99 bone scan and a Selective Digital Angiography of the right external inguinal artery followed. On the bone scan the first two phases were negative, while the third showed slight enhancement in the soft tissue of the right thigh, without indications of high vascular infiltration or bone involvement. On digital angiography, neither evidence of arterial involvement was found, nor an outflow vein.\nExcisional biopsy was performed under general anaesthesia due to the benign features of the lesion, resulting from the imaging workup. The mass was widely excised with the superficial vastus lateralis fascia attached. Histological examination revealed irregular calcification, fascicular cell arrangement, with fusiform nuclei and thin nucleolus, without atypia, but with degeneration. No mitoses were present. The neoplasm included several vessels, most with well-marked walls and was excised with clear margins ().\nOn immunohistochemical evaluation, SMA and caldesmon were positive, few cells were S-100 positive, while EMA, CD68, CD34, CD99, bcl2 and ki-67 index were negative (). So the immuno-morphological diagnosis was angioleiomyoma with degenerative changes. The patient was followed regularly at the outpatient clinic, with the last visit being 4 years after the excision. No local recurrence or distant metastases were noticed."
"A 25-year-old G1P1 woman who had a cesarean section 14 days before at a private clinic was complaining of abdominal pain and abnormal vaginal discharge. Ultrasound showed a uterine dehiscence in lower uterine segment at the site of cesarean section with hematoma in utero vesical pouch about 5 cm communicating with fluid in the uterus through dehiscence []. The patient had no fever. She was in a generally stable condition. The patient received antibiotics therapy and was under observation. The patient was monitored for infection markers (C-reactive protein and leukocyte count) and underwent abdominal ultrasonography weekly. Over 3 weeks, the collection resolved with fibrosis of the dehiscence and the patient was discharged. The patient was monitored for 6 months with no sequels."
"A 25-year-old G1P1 who had a cesarean section 14 days before outside our hospital was complaining of abdominal pain and abnormal vaginal discharge. Ultrasonography showed fluid collection in the uterus with dehiscent uterine scar []. The patient was diagnosed with infected uterine dehiscence. She received antibiotics and followed conservatively. The patient was monitored as above. After 2 weeks, the patient was discharged."
"A 25-year-old primigravida, unemployed, was sent to our outpatient clinic at the 10th week of gestation because of gestational diabetes diagnosed during the first trimester of pregnancy and multinodular goiter with normal thyroid function. She was supplemented with 5 mg of folic acid and 200 μg of iodine per day.\nFirst trimester combined screening revealed reduced risk for aneuploidies: trisomy 21 (1:16,185), 18, and 13 (1:100,000) with pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A = 3 MoM and free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin = 0.92 MoM. At ultrasound there was a live fetus with a cephalocaudal length of 65.9 mm (gestational age of 12 weeks and 6 days) and a nuchal translucency of 2.8 mm (above the 95thcentile), normal Doppler of ductus venosus, and normal nasal bones. Skull, brain, spine, abdominal wall, stomach, kidneys, bladder, both hands, and feet were scanned and no abnormalities were found. The placenta was located on the anterior wall of the uterus and the amniotic fluid was normal.\nAt the mid-trimester, US scan performed at 20 weeks and 5 days of gestation, she had a live fetus in breech position. The amniotic fluid was slightly increased. The fetus had a head circumference of 203 mm and a biparietal diameter of 55.8 mm, both above the 95th centile for gestational age []. The skull had a frontoparietal narrowing in transverse view (“lemon sign“), with no apparent intracranial abnormalities including cystic structures, midline shift, or ventricular dilatation []. The cerebellum diameter was appropriate for gestational age (21.6 mm).\nThe face had no apparent dysmorphism, with full integrity of the upper lip, inner-palate, and nose, as well as normal crystallins. Fetal facial profile was normal, with no apparent mandibular hypoplasia and nasal bones had an adequate size (7.15 mm).\nIn a cross-section view of the trunk, there was an increased cardiothoracic ratio []; in the sagittal section, there was a clear disproportion between the thoracic and the abdominal diameter conferring a “keel” or “bell” shape to the trunk, suggesting shortening of the ribs []. There were no other intrathoracic abnormalities, including lung, heart, or the mediastinum. The stomach, both kidneys, bladder and external (male) genitalia were normal.\nThe spine was normal with no signs of deviations or myelomeningocele. Concerning the limbs, the fetus had obvious shortening of the long bones, with a humerus of 16.6 mm, ulna of 19 mm, femur of 9 mm and fibula of 16.5 mm, all below the 5th centile for gestational age. Both the femur and humerus had a slight curvature with a “telephone receiver-like appearance” [Figures –].\nPostabortion face and profile radiographies confirmed these findings [Figure and ]."
"A 25-year-old white man, the only child of non-consanguineous parents, student, reported that with four years old he had noticed mild weakness and amyotrophy of hands and feet. He said never presenting tears and five years ago he referred change in timbre of his voice as well as difficulty in speech and deglutition. The neurologic examination showed atrophy and paresis (MRC 4) of the intrinsic of the hands and orsal flexor of feet, tongue fasciculations and atrophy (). The deep reflexes were abolished in the lower limbs and normal in upper limbs. Superficial and deep sensitivity are normal. The tongue was atrophic with fasciculation. There were orthostatic hypotension and increased heart rate. Electroneuromyography showed generalized denervation with normal sensory and motor conduction. Alacrimia was reported by his mother and later confirmedin Schimmer (below 1 mm) test. The biomicroscopy tests with fluoresce in and green his amy revealed: keratoconjunctivitis sicca, keratitis and accumulation of mucus on the corneal surface without impregnation by green his amy and absence of tears. Oesophageal manometry was characterized by normal basal pressure in lower sphincter with incomplete relaxation, absence of peristalsis in swallowing in the oesophageal body (achalasia). Gastricoesophageal junction showed diaphragmatic clamping with slight resistance to the passage of the apparatus in the presentation. The blood and the endocrine tests were normal: cortisol, 13.8 mmg/dL; FSH, 3.64 mmUI/mL; LH 3.8 mmUI/mL; Testosterone, 593.8 nanogram/dL; ACTH, 1.5 picogram/mL. The patient underwent whole exome sequencing and two known pathogenic variants in the AAAS gene were found. The first c.938T>C (HGMD: CM023869) is a missense mutation that leads replaces the aminoacid Alanine for Valine in the residue 313 of the protein. The second variant c.1144_1147delTCTG (HGMD: CD024030) is a small deletion that disrupts the open reading frame and results in a premature stop codon (p. S382Rfs*33) ()."
"Patient 1 is a 25-year-old male with ESHL (Stage IA), presenting with cervical nodal involvement. Our analysis assumes he has favourable characteristics at diagnosis (Raemaekers et al, ; Radford et al, ), including absence of B symptoms, mediastinal bulk or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (favourable)."
"Patient 2 is a 25-year-old female with ESHL (Stage IIA), presenting with right cervical, hilar and bilateral axillary disease. Her disease has an unfavourable classification, due to the number of involved nodal groups (four), although she, like Patient 1, has no evidence of B symptoms, elevated ESR or bulky disease (unfavourable)."
"A 25-year-old male presented with 7-year history of recurrent pain and swelling in right thigh with no systemic features. Examination revealed a diffuse firm swelling in the right thigh posteriorly and a small scar from past incision and drainage. He did not respond to multiple courses of antibiotics and surgery. Bone biopsy was normal. MRI revealed an area of altered signal intensity with enhancement in the mid portion of diaphysis of right femur with evidence of cortical thickening, suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis. Tc99m-MDP bone scan showed mildly osteoblastic lesion with cortical thickening in the same area. He showed good response to 500 mg twice daily naproxen."
"A 25-year-old woman underwent resection of advanced thyroid cancer and tracheostomal creation. Following a surgical site infection, the neck skin surrounding the tracheostoma became necrotic and the carotid artery was eventually exposed. To cover the carotid artery and to reconstruct neck skin surrounding the tracheostoma, a 15.5 × 6 cm IMAP flap was transferred based on the second perforator (Fig. ). Approximation of the donor site was possible, and the postoperative course was uneventful."
"A 25-year-old Han Chinese woman presented to the emergency department of our hospital with abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and emesis for 3 days. She could pass stool and flatus but with significant reduction. She denied bloody stools, fever, chills, or weight loss. In the past decade, she had experienced abdominal pain that would disappear after rest without any treatment. There was no known precipitating factor for the abdominal pain. She reported no other symptoms, such as constipation or diarrhea. There was no significant family history of genetic disease or cancer. Her antenatal history was unremarkable. Physical examination showed abdominal distension, tenderness, and rigidity. Routine laboratory values were unremarkable. After ultrasonography revealed an expanded intestinal lumen, we performed abdominal computed tomography (CT), which showed abnormal dilatation of the intestine (). A nasogastric tube was inserted, and approximately 300 mL of dark green fluid was drained.\nBecause of the peritoneal irritation and CT scan result, exploratory laparotomy was performed. The dilated intestine was intraoperatively identified as a duplicated tube volvulus of the distal part of the descending and proximal part of the sigmoid colon. No intestinal adhesions or coexistent congenital anomalies were found. The anomalous segment had separate intestinal walls. There was only one connection between the anomalous and normal lumens at one end of the duplicated colon; that is, a Y-shaped tubular duplication. Partial colectomy of the descending and sigmoid colon was performed, followed by end-to-end anastomosis without ostomy. Postoperative pathology findings confirmed colonic duplication (). Grossly, the duplicated colon was approximately 72 cm long and measured 15 cm in greatest diameter. Microscopically, the duplicated colonic segment showed muscular hypertrophy. No gastric heterotopy or adenocarcinoma was found; 10 lymph nodes were identified and all were unremarkable. The patient developed fever postoperatively, which was responsive to an antipyretic and was categorized as a grade I surgical complication according to the Clavien–Dindo classification system. She was discharged on postoperative day 14 and followed for 2 years without specific events or complications.\nThis report was reviewed and approved by the Peking Union Medical College Hospital Institutional Review Board. The patient provided written informed consent for publication of this case report."
"A 25-year-old male with multiple swellings all over the body since childhood presented with history of headache of 1-year duration. On examination, multiple neurofibromas were evident. Imaging revealed a peripherally placed right frontal lesion that was hyperdense on computed tomography (CT); on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the lesion was hypointense on T1-weighted (T1W), hyperintense on T2-weighted (T2W), and enhanced homogeneously on gadolinium []. Right frontal craniotomy was performed intraoperatively; a superficially located unencapsulated lesion involving the leptomeninges with a well-defined plane of cleavage was seen. Histopathology suggested PXA with interlacing fascicles of spindle cells and occasional giant cells. On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, Ki-67 proliferation was 2% []. Histology of subcutaneous nodule was suggestive of neurofibroma. Postoperative course was uneventful. Since there were no atypical cells, high cellularity, or necrosis, radiotherapy was not administered. The patient remained asymptomatic for next 2 years and then presented again with complaint of headache for 15 days. Repeat MRI revealed a recurrent lesion with heterogeneous enhancement, necrosis, and edema. Craniotomy this time revealed an infiltrating vascular lesion with evidence of necrosis intraoperatively. Histology turned out to be glioblastoma with palisading cells, necrosis, and nuclear pleomorphism. Giant cells were occasionally seen and mitoses were 8–10 per high-power field. Adjuvant focal radiotherapy (60 Gy) was administered. At 3-year follow-up, the patient continues to remain asymptomatic while repeat MR did not show any recurrence.\nA proper informed consent was obtained from the patient."
"A 25-year-old male was evaluated in another hospital for nonspecific neck pain, MRI scan was showing fusiform enlargement of the cervical cord by an intramedullary lesion at C2 vertebral body level, which was hyperintense on T1 and intense contrast enhancement. He underwent C2 laminectomy and excision of the lesion. There was a blackish pigmented lesion on the surface of the cord going deep intramedullary. Histopathology showed cells with cytoplasm rich in melanin positive for S100 and HMB-45, nuclear pleomorphism and prominent nucleoli suggestive of melanotic schwannoma. He is on follow-up for the last 5 years, and there is no evidence of recurrence on follow-up imaging [Figures –]."
"A 25-year-old primigravida was sent to the hospital due to gestational diabetes. First trimester ultrasound (US) scan and combined screening revealed reduced risk for aneuploidies as follows: trisomy 21 (1: 16,185), 18, and 13 (1: 100,000), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A = 3 MoM, free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin = 0.92 MoM, and a nuchal translucency of 2.8 mm (above the 95th centile for gestational age). At the mid-trimester US, the amniotic fluid was slightly increased, the fetus had a head circumference (203 mm), and a biparietal diameter (55.8 mm) above the 95th centile []. The skull had a frontoparietal narrowing (“lemon” sign) [], with no apparent intracranial abnormalities. There were an increased cardiothoracic ratio and a clear disproportion between the thoracic and the abdominal diameter (“keel-shaped” or “bell-shaped” trunk) suggesting shortening of the ribs [Figures and ]. There was an obvious shortening of the long bones below the 5th centile, including the humerus (16.6 mm), ulna (19 mm) [], femur (9 mm) [], and fibula (16.5 mm); both the femur and humerus had a slight curvature (telephone receiver shape) []. Face, lungs, heart, abdomen, genitalia, and spine were normal."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Conservative and Endodontics with a chief complaint of discolored maxillary left central incisor and pain in relation to maxillary right central incisor. The medical history of the patient was noncontributory. The patient has noticed color change [] and it increased over 5–6 months. Review of dental history revealed a trauma 8 years back and teeth remained untreated. Intraorally, the periodontal probing depths were physiological at all sites except for distopalatal surface where sinus tract and necrosed material were present. Preoperative radiographs revealed an irregular and mottled appearance in the cervical third of the external root surface at distal aspect of 21 [] and widening of the periodontal ligament is seen in relation to 11 []. To locate the exact position and extension of the defect, CBCT was advised. On interpretation of CBCT, the lesion was supraosseous []. A diagnosis of pulp necrosis with external cervical root resorption (Heithersay's class III) was made for 21 and chronic apical periodontitis for 11, and therefore, root canal therapy for 11, 21, and surgery for sealing the resorptive defect was planned for 21. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. Rubber dam was placed. Under local anesthesia (2% lignox, with adrenaline 1:80,000, Indoco Remedies Ltd., Mumbai), access cavity was prepared on lingual surface. After working length determination of both the teeth [], chemomechanical preparation was done till F5 ProTaper universal rotary system and irrigation was performed with normal saline (Baxter Pvt Ltd., Aurangabad) solely, due to the presence of the root canal perforation for 21 and 5 ml of 3% NaOCl (Vishal Dentocare Pvt., Ltd., Ahmedabad, Gujarat) for 11. Both the teeth were obturated using lateral and warm vertical condensation technique []. The periodontal reparative surgery was performed immediately after the completion of root canal treatment.\nA full mucoperiosteal flap was reflected to remove granulomatous tissue which was excavated from the resorptive area []. The resorptive area was treated with 90% trichloracetic acid (Organo Biotech Laboratories Pvt Ltd., Mayapuri, Delhi) for 30 s. and the resorptive area was filled with biodentine (Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fosses, France) and contoured properly and allowed to set for 15 min to achieve initial setting and relative hardness. After radiographic confirmation [], the flap was repositioned and sutured.\nClinical examinations were performed for treated teeth after 6 months. The patient was completely asymptomatic and probing depth was within normal limits, indicating that repair of resorption defect was successfully performed with biodentine [ and ]."
"A 25-year-old woman with overt Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome suggestive of a right posteroseptal AV-AP and a history of syncope associated with sustained paroxysmal palpitations was referred for RF ablation.\nThe electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm (SR) showed a PR interval of 0.11 s and a QRS duration of 0.12 s with a negative delta wave in the inferior leads and lead V1 as well as a R/S transition between V1 and V2 (Figure ).\nProgrammed atrial and ventricular stimulation revealed fast non-decremental conduction over a unidirectional anterograde right posteroseptal AV-AP and retrograde dual AV nodal pathway conduction. The effective refractory periods (ERPs) of the anterograde AV-AP and the AV node were 270 and 230 ms, respectively. With incremental atrial pacing, a maximum pre-excitation pattern at a cycle length (CL) of 400–353 ms (Figure ) and anterograde conduction block over the AV-AP followed by 1:1 conduction over the AV node-His-Purkinje system axis at a CL of 333 ms were demonstrated. Mapping the right posteroseptal region, the shortest AV interval (45 ms) with the earliest ventricular activation preceding the delta wave (−15 ms) were found inferior to the coronary sinus ostium (Figure ). Two applications of RF energy at the mapped posteroseptal site resulted reproducibly in prompt transient AP conduction block. A third RF application abolished ventricular pre-excitation (Figures and ).\nPost-ablation, incremental atrial pacing, and atrial extra-stimulation performed during non-preexcited SR revealed a marked slow and decremental AP conduction resulting progressively in a marked to nearly maximum pre-excitation pattern similar to that before ablation (Figures and ).\nThe ERP (240 ms) and the longest atrial paced CL with conduction block of the AV-AP (353 ms) were similar to those before ablation. This was suggestive of conduction over the same short AV-AP, showing the earliest ventricular activation at the level of the tricuspid annulus.\nIntravenous administration of adenosine during non-preexcited SR resulted in unmasking latent ventricular pre-excitation due to slow decremental AV-AP conduction (6 and 12 mg; Figure ) and transient complete AV block (18 mg; Figure ). The maximum pre-excitation pattern (Figure ) was identical to that during atrial pacing techniques pre-ablation. Complete permanent elimination of AV-AP conduction was achieved by delivering additional nine RF applications during atrial pacing within the same right posteroseptal region (Figure ), which was verified by intravenous adenosine and programmed stimulation before and after isoproterenol."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented to the emergency room with dyspnea and markedly reduced effort capacity. Medical history was notable for an uneventful pregnancy and normal delivery of a healthy baby 1 week prior to presentation. Dyspnea on exertion started on the 2nd postpartum day, progressed, and the patient reported paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for 3 nights. Her admission vitals were normal except tachypnea and a relatively low oxygen saturation (93%). Physical examination revealed general pallor, bibasilar rales, and S3. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. Ventricular dilatation, increased ventricular filling pressure, moderate systolic dysfunction, and moderate mitral regurgitation were found on TTE, together with an sPAB of 40 mmHg. A hypoechoic mass with irregular borders concurrent with a thrombus was apparent in the left ventricle (). Liver and kidney function tests were within normal limits; brain natriuretic peptide and D-dimer levels were high. Autoimmune panel and thyroid function tests were normal.\nPatient was admitted to the coronary care unit with presumed diagnoses of peripartum cardiomyopathy and an apical thrombus. Diuresis and heparinization were initiated. Cardiac tomography scan (CTC) was planned to investigate the accompanied cardiac anomaly causing ventricular thrombus development, and apical cardiac thrombus was confirmed (, ). On the 3rd day of admission, a control TTE showed that the embolus had diminished in size. To exclude coronary heart disease, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) was scheduled, and ICA performed on the 5th day revealed a normal coronary artery () concurrent with peripartum cardiomyopathy. Patient was maintained on diuretics and coumadin and was discharged on the 10th day of admission. Control TTE in the 1st month showed improvement of ventricular diameters, absence of embolus, and an EF of 50%. Patient was maintained on anticoagulation and 1st year TTE was within normal limits. Patient was counseled for further pregnancies and increased risk of cardiac and thromboembolic events."
"A 25-year-old female, diagnosed with hemoglobin E (HbE)-beta thalassemia at 4 years of age by genetic testing, requiring monthly packed red blood cell transfusion (transfusion dependent) had Xmn1 polymorphism +/-genotype. At 24 years of age, hydroxyurea was initiated, but she responded partially to hydroxyurea therapy (HU), requiring less frequent packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions. After 1 year on HU, she developed irregular, involuntary, twisting, and writhing movements in the left upper and lower extremities which were subacute in onset and developed over 10 days. No past medical history of infections, rheumatic fever, or family history of any movement disorder was noted. Physical examination suggested choreoathetoid movements in the left upper and lower extremities. Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal range except hemoglobin was 8.2 g/dl. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain [] showed loss of normal flow void signal in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) with multiple flow voids in the region of lenticulostriate branches. Diffusion-weighted imaging did not reveal abnormal restricted diffusion ruling out an acute basal ganglia stroke. She was started on aspirin and tetrabenazine for chorea. Since her symptoms persisted, a multislice, multiplanar computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the circle of Willis [] was done, suggesting mild narrowing of petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of the right internal carotid artery (ICA). The M1 and M2 segments of the right MCA were thin in caliber with paucity of its distal branches, and multiple collaterals were noted in the lenticulostriate region suggestive of moyamoya vessels. Other medical conditions associated with MMS such as vasculitis, autoimmune conditions, infections, thrombophilias, and connective tissue disorders were ruled out on history, physical examination, and relevant blood investigations. PRBC transfusions were reinitiated and aspirin was continued. She has continued to remain asymptomatic without neurological deficits. After 5 months, follow-up 3.0-Tesla MR angiography of cerebral vasculature using a three-dimensional time-of-fight sequence [] showed further narrowing of bilateral anterior cerebral arteries and its branches, namely callosomarginal and pericallosal arteries."
"A 25-year-old man presented to attention with progressive intermittent abdominal and back pains. The patient had a history of antiphospholipid syndrome, who 10 years ago developed a recurrent pulmonary embolus (PE) and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) despite therapeutic anticoagulation. He was treated with daily Rivaroxaban therapy and a retrievable Gunther Tulip (Cook, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) IVC filter was placed in his infrarenal IVC. At the time of presentation, the patient had an unremarkable exam, but a CTA demonstrated a segmentally occluded distal infrarenal IVC (Fig. A). The IVC filter limbs were protruding out of the small atretic IVC, and extending into the infrarenal aorta, L3 vertebral body and right psoas muscle (Fig. ). The IVC filter limb protruding into the aorta was also piercing the aortic backwall, and was a nidus for partial thrombosis and stenosis of the aortic lumen (Fig. B and C). Given the patient’s symptoms and severity of filter limb injury into the aorta, the patient was offered an open explantation of the IVC filter and repair of the infrarenal aorta (Fig. ).\nOperative repair was performed through a ventral mid-line laparotomy incision, left lateral mobilization of the right colon by dividing the white line of Toldt, and Kocher maneuver mobilization of the duodenum. The underlying infrarenal vena cava and aorta were each visualized and exposed along their lengths to facilitate proximal and distal control of the area involving the IVC filter. The atretic chronically occluded distal IVC was proximally and distally ligated and transected. The IVC filter was mobilized with care and a wire cutter was used to dissociate it from the limbs embedded in the aorta and lumbar spine. The filter limb embedded in the lumbar spine was highly fibrosed and was left in place in the bone. The infrarenal aorta was proximally and distally clamped and a ventral arteriotomy was made to facilitate removal of remaining filter leg. Dorsal aortic luminal thromboendarterectomy and ventral wall patch angioplasty with bovine pericardium was performed. The patient recovery was unremarkable, and he was maintained on therapeutic anticoagulation. Postoperatively, a CTA at 3 months demonstrated a stable repair and patent infrarenal aorta (Fig. )."
"A 25-year-old male was admitted to Neurosurgery ward with head injury. He had no loss of consciousness, vomiting, and seizure but bleeding from nose present. His GCS was 15/15, there were bilateral black eyes with per orbital swelling, and hence, his vision and pupil could not be assessed. Except anosmia no other cranial nerves, motor, and sensory deficit detected. A plain noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) head revealed a fracture of Left frontal bone involving the sinus with depression of posterior wall of the sinus, underlying multiple contusions of the frontal lobe and no pneumocephalus []. He was kept on antibiotic and anticonvulsant and strictly in the supine posture. He was made to sit up after 48 h and checked for CSF rhinorrhea, which was not present. He was discharged on the 10th day in a stable neurological condition. A month later, he was readmitted in an altered sensorium with repeated vomiting. He was drowsy, irritable, and confused, his GCS was 13/15, pupil right side was normal, left moderately dilated and sluggishly reacting to light, and no other deficit was detected. The patient had MRI from outside [] which revealed a large left frontal intraparenchymal tension pneumatocele causing a mass effect. He was operated in emergency. Left frontal craniotomy, evacuation of tensed air, duraplasty, and exteriorization of frontal sinus was done. Postoperatively, he becomes fully conscious, and there was no neurological deficit. After 48 h, a repeat CT head [] was done, which showed minimal left frontal pneumatocele with no mass effect. The patient was discharged on the 10th day without any neurological deficit or CSF rhinorrhea. At his 6-month follow-up, he has no neurological deficit and no signs of rhinorrhea and meningitis."
"A 25-year-old female, with no significant medical or familial history, presented with rapidly growing right forehead mass beginning 2 months prior to admission. She had been followed for a diffuse forehead bulging since early in her second decade of life at a neurosurgical center in Kazakhstan. She underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess the soft bulging in her right frontal region 2 months prior to admission. The mass grew rapidly and she began to feel pain when the mass reached the size of a tennis ball. The patient was transferred to our hospital for definite diagnosis and treatment. The physical examination was normal except for a bulging, soft mass measuring 5.5 cm on the right forehead. She was free of neurological symptoms, and routine laboratory examinations were within normal limits. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed characteristic findings of FD with a heterogeneous ground-glass appearance of both the frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones, as well as a discrete cystic mass in the right frontal bone (). MRI also showed findings of FD in the bilateral craniofacial bone and indicated multi-septated fluid-fluid levels suggestive of ABC (). We performed a preoperative ophthalmological evaluation, in which visual acuity was 1.0 in both eyes, and there were no visual field, fundus, or eye movement abnormalities. For evaluation of the vascularity of the cystic mass and embolization of feeder arteries prior to surgery, a trans-femoral cerebral angiography was done. The angiography demonstrated moderate vascularity along the rim of the cystic mass and embolization via the right middle meningeal artery and right superficial temporal artery was performed. After embolization, the vascularity of the mass was markedly reduced ().\nThe patient underwent right frontal craniectomy with gross total resection of the brownish soft-tissue mass with multiple septated, brownish fluids and sediment-filled, cystic cavities followed by simple cranioplasty. The outer table thinned out as fine as paper, and the inner table was nearly absent. The histopathological findings of the skull lesion indicated FD with degenerative changes, forming typical ABC-like areas (). There was no evidence of malignancy in the surgical specimen. The FD was partially removed around the ABC, and after surgery (), the patient's cranio-facial deformity was dramatically improved (). No recurrence of the ABC nor progression of the FD was found at 6 months postoperatively."
"A 25-year-old girl presented to our outpatient department with sudden and severe loss of vision in both the eyes since 3 days. She was admitted in the medicine department 15 days before with a history of fever, severe malaise, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting of 5 days duration. She had also developed maculopapular rash over the trunk, limbs, and face on the sixth day of fever. She denied any history of visual disturbance during the course of her systemic illness. On investigation, the peripheral smear was negative for malarial parasite, and all other routine investigations were within normal limits except for thrombocytopenia with platelet counts of 9,000/μL at the time of admission. A diagnosis of DF was made after she was found positive for IgM, IgG, and dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS-1) antigen. She was started on supportive therapy and platelet transfusions, following which there was an improvement in platelet count. She was recovered and discharged from the hospital after a week.\nOn ophthalmic evaluation, the vision in her both eyes was no perception of light. External ocular examination revealed bilaterally symmetrical normally placed eyelids. Ocular movements were full and free on both sides. Anterior segment evaluation of the right eye revealed total yellowish white opaque cornea mimicking corneal abscess, thinned out inferiorly near the limbus. Left eye showed ciliary flush, mild corneal edema, medium to large sized keratic precipitates, and 360° posterior synechiae with complicated cataract precluding fundus view. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was high in the left eye. Penetrating keratoplasty was planned in the right eye (RE) to preserve corneal integrity and for the removal of inflamed corneal tissue. Intraoperative findings revealed edematous opaque cornea [], inflamatory pupillary membrane [], and complicated cataract []. Corneal graft was sutured with twelve interrupted bites using 10-0 nylon []. The specimen was sent for histopathology and microbiological examination. Preoperative B-scan ultrasonography of both eyes showed vitreous hemorrhage, total retinal detachment, and choroidal effusions [Fig. and ]. The patient was started on medical therapy for raised IOP along with topical corticosteroids and lubricants in both the eyes. Histopathological examination of corneal tissue revealed stromal breakdown with myxoid change and neovascularization. Stroma also showed mixed inflammatory infiltrate comprising neutrophils and lymphocytes []. There was no evidence of neutrophilic abscess or micro-organism. Overlying epithelium was unremarkable. Microbiological examination was unremarkable. The vision remained no perception of light in both the eyes after about 6 months of follow-up [Fig. and ]."
"A 25-year-old gentleman presented to us with an unstable prosthesis on the right side. He was diagnosed to have right eye secondary glaucoma with ciliary staphyloma at the age of 8 years for which he underwent an enucleation with 18-mm PMMA implant. Six years later, he developed post-enucleation socket syndrome with a shallow of inferior fornix. He was operated for fornix formation over three sittings in the postoperative period over the next 11 years; however, he had recurrent shortening of the fornix. On examination, there was lower eyelid laxity with shallow inferior fornix and a grade 2 SSD. The implant was migrated in the inferotemporal quadrant and palpable anterior to the inferior orbital rim. He underwent a PSI placement in the inferotemporal quadrant. This was followed by a fornix formation suture with mucus membrane graft for surface expansion. A COP was fabricated and dispensed 6 weeks thereafter. Over the next 20 months, both the implants remained stable and so did the inferior forniceal depth. There was a posterior movement of the spherical implant in the z-axis along with its centration in the orbit following the placement of PSI []."
"A 25-year-old male diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago, who begun antiretroviral therapy (ART) with emtricitabine/tenofovir/ritonavir/atazanavir, only 2 months before his visit to the dermatology clinic, presented with long-standing perianal condyloma acuminata and an 8-month history of a steadily enlarging tumor involving the nail bed of the ring finger of his right hand. The tumor occupied the entire nail bed, distal matrix, and peripheral nail folds, thus producing anonychia; it had irregular borders and a keratotic hyperpigmented surface with focal areas of red discoloration. The extension of the brown pigment to periungual skin folds additionally created a pseudo-Hutchinson's sign []. Dermoscopy of the tumor showed a scaly, hyperkeratotic, and pigmented tumor with underlying small dotted and comma vessels and a regression-like area, although the absence of pigment network was observed. With a clinical suspicion of subungual acral melanoma, a longitudinal biopsy of the nail apparatus was performed revealing a highly atypical keratinocytic proliferation involving the full thickness of the subungual epithelium and extending from the hyponychium to most of the proximal nail matrix. Neoplastic keratinocytes were highly pigmented and scattered monomorphous highly pigmented dendritic melanocytes were appreciated in the basal layer of the neoplasm (pigmented subungual SCCis). At the time, the patient had a total CD4+ T-cell count of 8 cells/μL (10% of all circulating T-cells) and a viral load of 14,636 copies/μL (log 4.17). The patient underwent complete resection of the nail apparatus including a 5 mm margin of uninvolved skin with immediate reconstruction through a full-thickness skin graft. Four months later, the skin graft had successfully healed, but two new similar lesions on the periungual area of the thumb and little finger of the left hand were present. At this time, the patient already had an undetectable viral load with 76 CD4+ cells/μL. Biopsies of such new lesions showed pigmented SCCis and complete excisions followed. A couple of months after both surgeries, viral load was undetectable with 127 CD4+ cells/μL. There was no recurrence of the lesions during a 3-year follow-up."
"A 25-year-old Saudi female with a known case of autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) presented to the emergency room in stuporous condition. For the past 7 years, she had been treated at a different hospital and prescribed irregular thyroxine replacement to regulate her menstrual cycles. The patient presented with fever, sore throat, vomiting, abdominal pain and confusion of 2 days duration.\nA blood sugar test by glucocheck revealed a blood sugar level of 1.7 mmols/l (30.6 mg/dl). The patient was resuscitated with intravenous glucose and her cognitive function promptly improved. Previously, she had experienced similar episodes of hypoglycemia following flu-like symptoms. The patient had a history of nausea, occasional vomiting, abdominal pain and weight loss of 20 kg over the past 2 years. There was no history of headache visual disturbance, galactorrhea, polyuria and polydipsia. The patient had a 6-year-old daughter and had been unsuccessful in conceiving since her daughter's birth. Following delivery, she had no history of postpartum hemorrhage but had experienced irregular menstrual cycles. There was no family history of autoimmune disease. Upon physical examination, the pulse was 102/min and the blood pressure was 100/64 mmHg. There was no hypo- or hyperpigmentation of the skin, hyperpigmentation of the buccal mucosa. The rest of physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The radiological imagings were normal; MRI of the pituitary fossa showed a partially empty sella with asymmetry of the residual pituitary gland [].\nThe patient was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, celiac disease (PAS III) and partial empty sella syndrome with hypopituitarism. Corticosteroids were initiated, followed by adjustment by adjustment of the Thyroxine. A gluten-free diet was advised by the dietician. The patient's symptoms improved and blood sugars were maintained within the normal range. Her thrombocytopenia responded quickly with steroid treatment []."
"A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency department after a fall from a chair onto her outstretched left hand. Due to mild alcohol consumption, communication with her was unsatisfactory. She complained of pain and inability to use her elbow, while no other injuries were found. She had a clear medical history, with no comorbidities, except smoking. Physical examination revealed swelling and “dinner fork” deformity of her left wrist, tenderness over her left elbow without any bruises or open wounds, while no obvious neurovascular injury was recognised. Frontal and lateral plain roentgenograms of her left forearm revealed a type-1 Bado Monteggia lesion accompanied with an ipsilateral type 1 Frykman distal radius fracture (Colles’ fracture) with dorsal comminution (, ). Fortunately, no other fractures were found around her elbow, such as coronoid process or radial head fracture. Presence of such associated injuries compromises the final outcome. The patient was operated on within 8 h after admission, under general anesthesia and tourniquet. At the operating room, the neurological examination was repeated, but no neurological disorder was indicated. The ulna was anatomically reduced and fixed through the classical lateral approach between flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris. Osteosynthesis was performed using a dynamic compression plate (3.5 mm limited contact dynamic compression plate [LC-DCP]). Intraoperative, fluoroscopy showed a spontaneous reduction of the anteriorly dislocated radial head after the ulna’s fixation. Subsequently, through a Henry approach, the distal radius fracture was reduced and fixed with a 3.5 mm T-shaped buttress locking plate (). Intraoperatively, after the fixation of both fractures, the elbow was found to be stable in all directions with a full range of motion of wrist, elbow, and forearm. The post-operative course was uneventful, and our patient was discharged 2 days after surgery with a dorsal plaster splint. The cast was removed 2 weeks after surgery, and then gradually the mobilization began. The range of wrist (arc: 108°) () and elbow (arc: 0—°) () motion, as well as the supination and pronation (overall arc: 175°) of the forearm recovered completely 2.5 months postoperatively (). Roentgenograms and clinical evaluation showed completed bone union of both fractures’ sides 3.5 months after surgery (, ). The patient returned to her daily routine within 4 months following injury. At last follow-up, 6 months postoperatively, the Broberg and Morrey (98/100) and Quick Dash scores (2.27% of disability) were excellent, without any decline in motion, strength, and stability, accompanied by no pain."
"A 25-year-old woman with cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis was referred for ERCP. Cholangiogram demonstrated a stone of about 1.2 cm in size in the bile duct. Sphincterotomy was performed. The patient developed oxygen desaturation, abdominal distension, and SCE soon after the sphicterotomy. The procedure was abandoned, and the patient was shifted to the ICU. CT scan showed bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, SCE, pneumoperitoneum, and pneumoretroperitoneum (Fig. c,d). The patient developed signs of peritonitis. Laprotomy and repair of a rent (2 cm) located in the posterolateral wall of the second portion of duodenum (Stapfer type 1 perforation) was performed. The patient was subsequently discharged in healthy condition."
"A 25-year-old man presented to our institution with painless gross hematuria for two days. He had no prior urologic disease history and no other medical problems. Complete blood count revealed the hemoglobin level of 104 g/L. Ultrasonography revealed a 46 mm × 25 mm hyperechoic mass in the bladder. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a mass of 26 mm × 18 mm in size on the left bladder wall. The hemoglobin level continued dropping to 88 g/L before surgery.\nAfter receiving the bladder irrigation and transfusion, emergency surgery of TURBT was performed because of persistent hematuria and continued dropping hemoglobin level. Cystoscopy revealed a broad-based mammillary tumor located on the left rear wall of urinary bladder. Postoperative histological examination of the resected specimen suggested the diagnosis of IMTUB (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), Vimentin, but negative for smooth muscle actin (SMA), S-100, P63, desmin, GATA3, CD34, myogenin, and β-catenin. No recurrence or progression was observed during the 2-year follow-up time."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with a tooth that showed a Miller class I gingival recession defect in the FDI tooth #41 area with a CAL of 1.5 mm. After undergoing the periodontal biotype modification technique described above, complete coverage of the defect was achieved and well maintained for 3 months ()."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted with trichoblastoma in the nuchal area with frequent recurrences since birth. The mass gradually increased to walnut-size, and the first excision surgery was performed in a local medical center (LMC) 3 years ago. The mass recurred at the same location and the patient underwent a second excision surgery at the LMC and was diagnosed with trichoblastoma after biopsy. After excision, the mass recurred with an increased size, and a third excision was performed in the LMC. However, when the mass recurred at the same site for the fourth time, the patient was transferred to our department (). The patient’s history, family history, and results of the laboratory study were unremarkable. A palpable lymph node was found in both, the internal jugular and popliteal cervical areas, and ultrasonography-guided aspiration was performed, but no metastasis was observed. The pathological diagnosis after the third excision surgery in the LMC was adnexal tumor with hair follicle differentiation with nonmalignant potential with involvement of the base. Immunohistochemistry results were positive for cytokeratin (+), p53 (−), and Ki-67 (1+). For accurate diagnosis, we requested for the specimen to be examined again in our pathology department. The specimen was identified as a skin adnexal carcinoma, of hair follicle origin and lowgrade malignancy (). The preoperative neck magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed lobulated soft tissue lesions involving superficial fascia and infiltrating into both proximal trapezius muscles (). Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed three hypermetabolic mass lesions about 4 cm in size on the subcutaneous layer of the posterior neck, and no distant metastases was observed. In the plastic surgery department, wide excision including a 1.5-cm safe margin and reconstruction with a free anterolateral thigh flap were performed. After extensive excision, histological examination revealed skin adnexal carcinoma, originating from the hair follicles, and low granular malignancy, consistent with trichoblastic carcinoma, with clear resection margin (). Even though partial flap necrosis had occurred, it was treated with debridement and split thickness skin graft. Neck MRI performed at 6 months postoperatively and PET-CT at 1 year postoperatively showed no remnant mass, recurrence, or distant metastasis. There was no palpable mass 5 years postoperatively, and there was no recurrence on follow-up of 5-year neck CT and PET-CT ()."
"A 25-year-old female patient with keratoconus attended our clinic in February 2017.\nUDVA was 3/10 on the right eye (OD) and 2/10 on the left (OS). CDVA was 7/10 (8/10\nwith pinhole) and 6/10 (10/10 with pinhole). Refraction OD was −0.75/−4.00/87° and\nOS −4.25/−3.50/122°. Corneal topography showed Kmax\n58.5 D OD and 58.9 D OS, while the thinnest point of corneal pachymetry was measured\nat 465 and 468 µm, respectively (). The patient had undergone bilateral corneal collagen\ncrosslinking (CXL) for progressive keratoconus in 2014, resulting in a stable\ncornea. For visual improvement purposes and due to contact lens intolerance, we\ndecided to proceed with a femtosecond laser-assisted ICRS implantation on the right\neye. In regard to our nomogram, we recommended an implantation of one Keraring with\n210° length and 300 µm thickness. The patient agreed and provided her written\nconsent for the scheduled procedure in March 2017.\nBriefly, after topical anesthesia with proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%, the corneal\napex was marked with ink under a surgical microscope Zeiss OPMI LUMERA 700 (Carl\nZeiss Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany). A suction ring of 9.5 mm was applied, and after\napplanation a corneal tunnel of 1.3 mm width was created with the Leonardo da Vinci\nFemtosecond Laser (LDV Z6; Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems AG, Allmendstrasse,\nSwitzerland) in the 5-mm zone with 80% corneal depth, as well as a single, radial,\n2.7-mm corneal incision at the tunnel starting point. The corneal tunnel length was\nequal to the ring segment arc length plus 10°. However, the intracorneal ring was\nnever introduced, due to corneal perforation at the incision site resulting in air\nbubbles in the anterior chamber and termination of the procedure.\nPostoperatively, regimen for the next 2 weeks four times per day included\nchloramphenicol 0.5% and ofloxacin 0.3% eye drops. Fluorometholone 0.1% eye drops\nwere administered four times per day for 4 weeks. A bandage contact lens was also\napplied (PureVision; Bausch & Lomb Inc., Rochester, NY, USA).\nOn postoperative follow-up 1 month after the procedure, UDVA was 8/10 and CDVA was\n10/10. Refraction was measured at −1.00/–3.00/80°. Corneal topography showed\nKmax of 57.3 D with the thinnest pachymetric point\nat 469 µm ().\nAnterior segment ocular coherence tomography revealed a full-thickness corneal\nincision, resulting in corneal microperforation (). On slit lamp, anterior chamber was\ndeep and quiet with negative Seidel sign. The patient maintained stable refraction\n(–1.0/–3.25/88°) and stable CDVA (9/10) at 6 months of follow-up postoperatively.\nCorneal topography showed Kmax of 57.7 D with the\nthinnest pachymetric point at 459 µm at 6 months postoperatively ()."
"A 25-year-old woman sought medical attention complaining of chest pain, with characteristics of pleurisy, at the base of the left hemithorax, which had progressed over the last 6 months. Initially, the symptom was intermittent and of variable duration. She denied fever or weight loss. Her past medical history included asthma and a papillary thyroid carcinoma, which was resected 8 years ago, with no evidence of relapse to date. The physical exam was normal except for the presence of a central neck scar. A chest radiograph () showed a round opacity (coin lesion) at the base of the left pulmonary inferior lobe, which, on the thoracic computed tomography () was revealed to be a peripheral lesion in close contact with the pleura, measuring approximately 2.5 cm in its longest axis.\nThe initial working diagnosis was a neoplastic lesion because of the prior thyroid disease. The patient was submitted to a thoracotomy, and a wedge pulmonary resection was performed. The specimen was analyzed by frozen sections, which ruled out malignancy. The post-operative recovery was uneventful and she was discharged on day 5 after surgery, and was kept off medications.\nGrossly, the lesion was round, measured 2.5 cm, and was surrounded by a dense and thick fibrous capsule with a softened and pearly-colored core, which contained concentric whitish layers resembling an onion (the latter was most evident after the formalin fixation) with few interspersed calcifications ( and ). Histopathology showed a sharp single nodule limited by a fibrous capsule. The center showed coagulative necrosis with concentric lines of mild calcification. The periphery showed palisaded histiocytes and moderate inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and some multinucleated giant cells. The Gomori-Grocott with silver methenamine (GMS) stain showed numerous rounded to oval clustered 2-4 µm yeast-like forms, consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum. The Ziehl–Neelsen staining failed to demonstrate acid fast bacilli. No malignancy was evidenced ( and ).\nRetrospectively, after the diagnosis had been made, the patient was quizzed about any risky exposure to histoplasmosis. She reported that, because of her work, she had been visiting caves and charcoal mines, and she had been working in a laboratory that was eventually inhabited by bats."
"A 25-year-old female without any significant pathological history, presented with a painful mass on the posterior side of her left thigh, with no history of trauma or septic inoculation, evolving for 15 months. She was suffering from pain and hyperesthesia of the underlying skin exacerbated by movements. The mass gradually increased in size becoming uncomfortable at rest. Physical examination revealed a soft immobile mass with tenderness to palpation and a normal overlying skin without inflammatory signs. Amyotrophy of the muscles of the tight was obvious compared to the opposite side. The left hip and knee range of motion were within normal limits. Ultrasonography showed a fluid mass consisting with an hydatid cyst of the soft tissue of the thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a rounded formation well-demarcated, developed in the biceps femoris muscle, measuring 3 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, and having a liquid-liquid level. This lesion is regularly enhanced on the edge, consisting with an abscess of the biceps femoris muscle ( and ). Facing diagnosis difficulties, an excisional biopsy was performed. The histological study of the resected mass revealed a GT without malignant features and with negative margins (, , ). Postoperatively, the patient was immediately relieved from pain, and she has been pain free for the last year."
"A 25-year-old man was involved in a cutting machine accident, resulting in complete amputation of his left middle and ring fingers at the base of the distal phalanx and at the shaft of the distal phalanx, respectively. The stumps of both affected fingers were severely crushed. Both fingers were replanted. At 3 weeks post-replantation, the middle finger had survived but the nail bed of the ring finger had necrotized. After removing the necrotic sterile matrix, we found the distal phalanx bone to be viable, so we covered it with a thenar fascial flap. In this particular case, skin and subcutaneous tissue were also carried over to cover a fingertip defect. Two weeks later, the flap was divided and nail bed grafting was performed. At the 9-month follow-up, one minor variation of the transverse groove was observed, and the new nail was graded as “very good” ()."
"A 25-year-old female patient presents with acute appendicitis. She is 30 weeks pregnant and no problems related to pregnancy were revealed during prenatal care. She is healthy, non-smoking, without anything notable in her past medical history (correct answer: ASA-PS IIE).\nWe considered Case 1, Case 6, and Case 8 as emergency clinical case and for this reason the respondents were asked to assign a score from IE to VIE."
"A 25-year-old female presented with right lumbago without palpitation, chest distress, and headache for 12 mo. On physical examination, palpation showed a giant mass without tenderness on the right upper abdomen; signs such as purple striae, moon face, and central obesity were not observed. The patient’s blood pressure was stable (120/80 mmHg).\nThe renal function and metabolism of electrolytes were normal. Tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (3.14 ng/mL), alpha-fetoprotein (1.54 ng/mL), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125 (12.8 U/mL), and CA199 (0.7 U/mL) and adrenal endocrinological examinations such as cortisol (7.56 µg/dL), aldosterone (162.7 pg/mL), metanephrine (34 pg/mL), and normetanephrine (69 pg/dL) were normal except for elevated serum β2-microglobulin (3986 ng/mL). The abdominal ultrasonography indicated a spherical solid mass (150 mm in diameter) in the right adrenal with a clear border and little blood flow signal. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a huge right adrenal tumor (181.5 mm × 115.0 mm × 107.2 mm), with diffused intralesional hemorrhage; the right lobe of the liver, right kidney, and inferior vena cava were significantly compressed (Figure ).\nSurgery was performed under general anesthesia via a transabdominal L-shaped incision. The hypervascular tumor was adherent to the liver and tightly connected to the right kidney and inferior vena cava. The tumor was successfully removed and vital signs remained stable during operation. Macroscopically, the tumor was 200 mm × 160 mm in diameter and 1262 g in weight (Figure ). The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 2000 mL. Severe complications were not observed and the patient was discharged 12 d after surgery."
"A 25-year-old man presented with complaints of decreased vision in the left eye, which he accidently noticed on covering the other eye. There was no history of systemic comorbidities, seizures, or retarded mental development. The best corrected Snellen visual acuity in the right and left eyes were 6/6 and 6/24, respectively. Examination of the anterior segment was normal in both the eyes and so was the vitreous cavity. The optic disk and retinal examination in the right eye were normal. In the left eye, fundus examination demonstrated an elevated lesion in the superior aspect of the optic disk accompanied with marked neovascularization on the surface with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema [Fig. and ]. Systemic examination revealed the presence of adenoma sebaceum, ashleaf spot, dental pits, and subungual fibromas [Fig. -]. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed tortuous and telangiectatic vessels with slow/no fill in the early phase [Fig. and ], whereas the late phase showed filling up of vessels within the lesion associated with exudation [Fig. and ]. B-scan ultrasonography showed focal calcification, acoustic shadowing behind the lesion []. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) over optic disk showed a hyperreflective mass with posterior shadowing []. OCT over the macula showed retinal disorganization with fluid-filled spaces and vitreous traction []. Computed tomography of the orbit to confirm the extent of the lesion showed multiple cortical tubers [Fig. and ], which had similar attenuation values as compared with the optic disk lesion [].\nPatient was diagnosed to have tuberous sclerosis as he fulfilled the diagnostic criterion and an aggressive variant of a retinal hamartoma was suspected. An intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab (Avastin) was administered and resulted in a three-line visual improvement (approximate early treatment diabetic retinopathy study [ETDRS] letter score of 21) with drastic reduction in macular edema []."
"A 25-year-old young woman was admitted to hospital in December 2017 complaining\nof left vulvar recurrent swelling for 10 months. The mass was painless, but\nprogressively growing in size. She had a previous history of vulvar breast\nfibroadenoma, which was surgically removed 4 years ago. She was free from\nrecurrence until a swelling of the same location was discovered during\npregnancy.\nA physical examination showed a 5 × 2 × 2-cm mass located beneath the scar at the\nleft lip of the labium majus. The mass was soft, movable, and well-defined. No\nabnormalities were found by abdominal and gynecological examinations. Neither\nfine-needle aspiration cytology nor computed tomography was used because\nultrasonography indicated a benign lesion. At this stage, tumor recurrence was\nnoted and we decided to proceed with broad tumor excision. The operation went\nsmoothly under local anesthesia. Frozen sections of tumor tissue were cut and\nshowed vulvar fibroadenoma. The incision was routinely closed. The patient was\ndischarged the next day after surgery. The patient was free of detectable\nlesions at a 6-month follow-up."
"The present case report is about a 25-year-old male, who had suffered a fall from a height in jungle and traumatic amputation of his left hand with remains of forearm amputated stump.\nPatient had no any past medical or surgical history. Patient had no similar family history.\nSuspecting the involvement of wild animals, patient was given anti rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin according to the WHO protocol. He also had suffered a sub arachnoid hemorrhage and was managed conservatively as advised by our neurosurgery department.\nAs for the amputated hand, high end prosthesis was advised for the patient but being from very poor background it was far beyond his budget. A man who depends entirely on daily wages and manual labor to feed himself and his family, losing the functionality of one hand was devastating and depressing for him. The main problem that presented before us was not only to stabilize him, but also allow him to get back into the society with gratitude and without having to depend on others for his daily chores and financial needs. Considering all these factors, Krukenberg operation was planned for him. Although this surgery is seldom done and even not recommended by many surgeons but it was currently the best available option for him. He was explained in detail about the procedure and extent of functionality he could attain. Videos and photographs were shown to further elucidate the whole process. Earlier the patient and relative were reluctant for the procedure but they had given the consent for the same.\nThe classical procedure described by Swanson and Swanson was followed with few modifications. A longitudinal incision was made on the flexor surface of the forearm. A similar incision on the dorsal surface slightly toward the ulnar side was made. The forearm muscles were separated into two groups and were resected in order to reduce the size of the stump.\nPronator teres was conserved as it is the main operating muscle. Hence all precautions were taken to maintain the integrity of the muscle. Hemostasis was secured. Skin edges were opposed and sutured. Post operative period was without complications. Regular dressing was done and physiotherapy was given so that the patient started using the pincers. Patient was regularly motivated. Help from the psychiatry department was taken to help him cope with his depression."
"A 25-year-old woman, with a three-year history of high-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy for connective tissue disease, was referred by the rheumatologist for the work-up of acute severe left knee pain. Her medical history included Raynaud’s disease, perionyxis, myositis, pulmonary hypertension, two episodes of pericarditis, and positive anti-nuclear antibodies: anti-RNP (anti-Ribonucleoprotein). Recently, the steroid dose had been increased because of exacerbated arthralgias and myalgias, and for the last six months, the patient was on up to 32 mg of oral methylprednisolone per day with one intravenous dose of 1 g of Solu-Medrol per month. Her physical exam was normal, especially demonstrating normal joint mobility and no joint effusion.\nIn this clinical context, corticosteroid-induced disorders (avascular necrosis, stress fracture, etc.) were suspected and a left knee MRI exam was requested ().\nThis initial MRI examination performed one week after pain onset showed no abnormality ().\nOne week later, because of persisting symptoms, a second MRI examination was obtained, showing subtle ill-defined “intriguing” dotted high signal abnormalities of the bone marrow of uncertain significance on proton density fat-saturated (PDFS) images, on the proximal tibial meta-diaphysis. Almost nothing was seen on the T1 images (). One week later, although the patient’s symptoms had almost completely resolved spontaneously, a third MRI was performed as a follow-up, as the prior imaging result was non-specific and did not bring a definitive diagnosis. It showed a more evident lesion with confluence of the high PDFS signal “dots” into a more continuous serpiginous line, giving a geographical appearance to the lesion, also becoming evident on the T1W MR image as a low signal line, corresponding to the typical MRI presentation of “established” bone marrow infarcts (). A seven-week follow-up MR examination was performed to document the evolution of the disease and showed the stability in size of this bone marrow infarct, but more evident confluence and thickening of the peripheral T1 and PDFS signal abnormalities ().\nKnowing the multifocal skeletal presentation of “systemic” ON, a whole-body MRI examination was performed for all skeleton screening. This examination revealed multiple bone marrow infarcts in femoral and tibial diaphyses and metaphyses, in line with systemic avascular necrosis; no epiphyseal involvement was observed ()."
"A 25-year-old female, known case of cardiac atrial septal defect, presented with sudden painless diminution of vision in OS for past 3 days following transesophageal echocardiography. OD was normal. OS best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/400 with normal anterior segment. Fundus [] and swept-source optical coherence tomography [SSOCT, ] showed premacular hemorrhage. Patient was diagnosed as OS Valsalva retinopathy following transesophageal echocardiography and kept on close follow-up. At 6 weeks, BCVA OS improved to 20/60. Premacular hemorrhage decreased in size [arrow, ]. Small area of hyper-reflectivity was persisting on SSOCT [arrow, ]. At 6 months, BCVA improved to 20/25. The hemorrhage resolved clinically []. The patient reported metamorphopsia that could be attributed to internal limiting membrane thickening visible on SSOCT []. In view of good visual acuity, the patient was not keen for surgical intervention."
"A 25-year-old male with past medical history of sickle cell disease with very few admissions for sickle cell pain crisis, low grade glioma that was resected 5 years ago presents to clinic with lump in his left neck for few months. A CT scan showed bilateral cervical adenopathy with a 7 cm predominant lymph node in the left cervical area. The pathology of excision biopsy was reviewed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as Epstein-Barr Virus positive Reed-Sternberg cells, and read as classical Hodgkin lymphoma, mixed cellularity type. The patient underwent PET scan showing confluent bulky lymph nodes centered in the posterior triangle of the entire left neck measuring up to 7.4 × 3.1 cm in total axial cross section, with maximum SUV range measuring up to 8. In the right neck, similar appearing hypermetabolic lymph nodes were seen individually measuring up to 1.5 cm with maximum SUV 4.9, much less extensive compared to the left side. No hypermetabolic nodes seen below the diaphragm.\nThe patient was followed up in clinic and started on treatment with ABVD regimen on day 1 and 15 of each cycle. On day 7 the patient followed up in clinic for labs and administration of IV fluids and blood transfusions as needed to keep hemoglobin above 7. He completed 4 cycles with significant decrease in size of neck lymph nodes with left internal jugular lymph node measuring 2.3 × 1.2 cm and standard uptake values ranged from 1.9–2.3. After completion of chemotherapy patient underwent consolidative radiation therapy with 30 Gy radiation to the involved site and additional 6-Gy boost sequentially administered to the PET- avid jugular nodes bilaterally. The patient was never admitted to the hospital during the entire course of treatment."
"A male baby, referred from outside, was born out of spontaneous vaginal delivery at 33 weeks of gestation to a 25-year-old primigravida. The birth weight was 2.3 Kg, and a history of consanguinity was present. The echocardiography revealed 6.8 mm OsASD with left to right shunt. The parents refused treatment."
"A 25-year-old female, known case of papillary carcinoma of thyroid, was posted for total thyroidectomy. She gave a history of multiple drug allergies with a history of angioedema after consuming diclofenac. Skin allergy test revealed allergy to almost all antibiotics, general and local anesthetic drugs. She used to take oral paracetamol when febrile."
"On May 10, 2017, a 25-year-old woman came to our hospital for a further treatment of 1 tumor of pancreatic head found by ultrasonic inspection in 1 other hospital. On June 13, 2017, she was admitted to our department. Our computed tomographic's saw a 2.0 × 2.1-cm lesion located in the head of pancreas and its diagnosis was nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography scan demonstrated a solitary 1.6 × 1.7-cm lesion located in the head of pancreas, and its diagnosis was tumor. The patient's condition was good and symptomless, without any disease history. Physical examination and routine blood investigations were normal. All pancreatic malignant tumor markers were negative. On July 2, 2017, a total laparoscopic duodenum and common bile duct-preserving pancreatic head resection were performed (Fig. ; with operation video in the supplementary file). The patient was placed in a supine position. After successful pneumoperitoneum with CO2 gas insufflated until the abdominal cavity pressure reached 10 to 12 mm Hg and 4 trocars were placed, a high-definition laparoscopy was inserted. The proposed line of parenchymal incision was circumferentially scored with a sewing a stitch, maintaining an approximate 10 mm margin away from the tumor. The tumor was sharply excised by ultrasonic knife. The diagnosis of intraoperative frozen pathology was SPN. Roux-Y pancreaticojejunostomy was done, and a drain was left nearby pancreaticointestinal anastomosis. The blood loss was 150 mL. The patient's recovery was smooth after surgery. Postoperative pathology confirmed the diagnosis of SPN with a negative margin. At the end of 20 months follow-up, she was well and showed no signs of recurrence."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to the Alexandria University Hospital ENT clinic complaining of bilateral parotid swelling and right parotid sinus. The condition started 4 months prior by right parotid abscess, which was treated elsewhere by incision and drainage. The patient received medical treatment with partial improvement. Although partial improvement was noted, there was right parotid sinus formation with persistent pus drainage and no response to medical treatment. On admission, complete physical examination was done. The patient was conscious and alert with toxic look and fever. Standard ear, nose, and throat examination revealed bilateral parotid and submandibular gland swellings. The right parotid was tender with pus-draining sinus (). There was grade IV facial palsy on the right side. Examination of the external nose demonstrated supratip nasal depression (saddling) (). Nasal endoscopy revealed nasal crustations, inflamed mucosa, and 2 posterior septal perforations. Rheumatoid factor and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) were negative with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein. Both chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Histopathological assessment of parotid open biopsy revealed heavy chronic suppurative granulomatous inflammation with fistula formation. Histopathological assessment of nasal biopsy revealed heavy chronic lymphoplasmacytic granulation tissue with granulomatoid lesions, vasculitis, and superadded heavy suppurative necrosis, featuring GPA ( and ). The patient was referred to the rheumatology department to start the definite treatment of GPA: corticosteroids and immunosuppressant."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Neurology with the symptoms of acute onset of sensory disturbance and numbness for 7 d. He was homosexual and exposed to unprotected intercourse. A neurological examination revealed hypalgesia below the T6 level. The other physical examinations were normal. Laboratory tests revealed the treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) were positive, and the serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) was 1:16. The antibody against HIV was negative. The levels of homocysteine, folic acid, and vitamin B12 were 26 μmol/L (0-15 μmol/L), 2.59 ng/mL (>5.4 ng/mL), and 325 pg/mL (211-911 pg/mL), respectively. The results of cerebrospinal fluid test (CSF) showed a higher level of cells (110/μL) and protein (148 mg/dL). The immunological tests of aquaporin 4 (AQP4)-IgG were negative both in serum and CSF. The other inflammatory, immune, and infectious biomarkers both in CSF and serum were also unremarkable. The cranial MRI yielded normal findings. However, the spinal cord MRI showed abnormal longitudinally extensive T2 weighted hyperintensities involving the posterior columns from C7 through T6, with characteristic ""flip-flop sign"" on cervical spinal MRI (Figure , Figure ). Focal contrast enhancement was observed in the dorsal aspect of the thoracic cord on T1 weighted gadolinium-enhanced images at T3-T4 level (Figures and ).\nWith the treatment of penicillin (24-million IU/d) for 2 weeks, the symptoms of sensation almost disappeared 3 months later. The abnormal hyperintensities of spinal MRI also resolved at the 3-month follow-up (Figure ). Moreover, the laboratory data of CSF showed reduced cells (24/μL) and protein (65 mg/dL). The findings of TPPA and TRUST (1:8) in serum were still positive. The examination of CSF showed that TPPA was positive and TRUST was 1:1. The diagnosis of syphilitic myelitis was established according to the history of homosexuality, clinical manifestations, MRI findings with typical ""flip-flop sign"", also with the favorable prognosis after the penicillin treatment.\nOur study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this case."
"A 25-year-old female was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, BVDU, Dental College and Hospital, Pune, India, with a chief complaint of swelling and pain located at the posterior body and ascending ramus of the right hemimandible. In the clinical examination, facial asymmetry was absent. Intraorally, mild swelling was present in the right mandibular third molar region. The overlying mucosa appeared normal on color and texture. There was no involvement of lymph nodes. The patient was evaluated radiographically by panoramic radiography. The imaging revealed a unilocular radiolucency extending from the mid-ramus to the right second molar [].\nFine-needle aspiration yielded thick white “cheesy” material. Under local anesthesia, an incision extending from the mandibular ramus distal to the right third molar was carried anteriorly around the crevices of the anterior mandibular teeth till right first molar and a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised. Extraction of the right third molar was done. The lateral cortical plate adjacent to the cyst was removed. The cystic cavity was curetted from the right mid-ramal area to right second molar. The resulting cavity was packed with povidone iodine gauze. The packing was replaced, during the recall visits, three times in a week for 4 months following the initial surgery. The patient was reviewed radiographically every 6 months during the follow-up period. At the end of the follow-up period, no evidence of recurrence was noticed [Figures and ]."
"A 25-year-old man had a fall during a football match where his right leg was trapped under his body. He had pain over the ankle and especially proximally in the leg. Inspection revealed a prominent fibular head (). Stability testing of the right knee showed no instability and the peroneal nerve was intact. X-rays (of both legs/knees) showed an anterolateral dislocation in the proximal tibiofibular joint (). The dislocation was treated with closed reduction under spinal anesthesia. The joint was then stable when tested. He avoided weight bearing for 2 weeks. At 6 months follow-up, the patient played football at the same level as before the injury."
"The third patient was a 25-year-old woman, with a long history of DED (for at least 6 years) unsuccessfully treated with ocular lubricants and topical steroids. Clinically, she showed a PED in the lower quadrant of the right eye. She also referred recurrent episodes of acute pain (more than three times per month) in the left eye due to RCEs episodes despite the use of bandage contact lens. During anamnesis, patient reported suffering type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), anemia, numerous food allergies, and autoantibody positivity (ANA and ANCA)."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with fevers and Streptococcus anginosus bacteraemia. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a markedly dilated right coronary artery (RCA) with a fistula entering the basal inferior LV with turbulent Doppler flow across the mitral valve (MV) (FigureA). Transoesophageal echocardiography confirmed the dilated RCA (FigureB and D) and revealed a strand-like echodensity associated with the posterior MV leaflet tip, consistent with infective endocarditis. The patient was treated for infective endocarditis with a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics.\nThe case was presented at a multidisciplinary heart team meeting. Given the significant rupture risk that her dilated RCA-LV fistulae posed, the decision was made for elective percutaneous closure 6 months after clearance from infection. A cardiac CT was performed (FigureC) and a 3D model of the coronary arteries and LV was printed (FigureE and F). The model clearly demonstrated the dilated RCA fistulating with the LV, with an attractive distal target for percutaneous closure (FigureE and F). On presentation to the patient, the model clearly highlighted the anomalous artery, improving the understanding of the proposed procedure and overall informed consenting process.\nThe patient is currently completing a prolonged 6-month course of antibiotics prior to planned percutaneous intervention."
"A 25-year-old Afrodescendant male patient presented at the oral medicine service with a large, fluctuant, painless swelling with resilient consistency in the submental and left submandibular region (). Intraorally, there was a small, smooth surfaced, normochromic and movable mass in the floor of the mouth, adjacent to the lingual frenulum.\nUltrasonography (US) of the left submandibular gland showed a well-defined, homogeneous, round, and hyperechoic mass with a diameter of 6.8 × 4.7 cm localized between the geniohyoid and mylohyoid muscle that extended to the medial region of the neck. Also, ductal dilatation and lithiasis were discarded. Computed tomography (CT) showed a well-defined cystic lesion in the submental and submandibular space without peripheral enhancement ().\nThe aspiration puncture was performed and demonstrated a content of friable and white material. The diagnostic hypotheses established by the dentist were plunging ranula, dermoid cyst, or epidermoid cyst. Surgical excision of the lesion was performed through an extraoral incision () under general anesthesia and nasotracheal intubation.\nThe surgical specimen was submitted to histopathologic examination. Gross examination revealed a well-circumscribed, solid oval mass, with a firm consistency and a yellowish surface (). On the cross-section, the tumor showed a cystic structure varying in color from gray to dark brown, contained a keratin-like yellow material. Microscopic examination revealed a cystic cavity lined by orthokeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, exhibiting acanthosis, and hypergranulosis. The cystic capsule was composed of dense fibrous connective tissue containing cutaneous adnexa, such as sebaceous and sweat glands. Additionally, discrete chronic inflammatory infiltrate was observed ().\nBased on these findings, the histologic diagnosis was DC. The patient is under follow-up without signs of recurrence two years after the surgery ()."
"A 25-year-old lady, Mrs. G, P1L1, 6 months postpartum, presented with a 1-year history of hallucinatory behavior, hostility toward family members, disorganized behavior, and poor bonding with a physically healthy infant. During 6 months of the postpartum period, she became socially aloof, muttering to self, not sleeping at nights, and holding a false belief that her face has turned ugly, in the absence of any visible facial skin changes. On mental status examination, poor cooperation, difficulty in establishing rapport, poverty of speech, second person auditory hallucinations, which patient refused to elaborate, and dysmorphic delusion were established. She was diagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia and treated by a psychiatrist with risperidone 6 mg/day for 3 months, without much improvement. When she came to our hospital, considering a failed response to treatment, risperidone was cross tapered with oral olanzapine up to 20 mg per day over 1 week. During 3 weeks of inpatient care, an improvement was noted in hallucinations, self-care, and bonding with the infant.\nHowever, there was development of non-pruritic, non-erythematous, self-limiting papulopustular (acneiform) skin eruptions over the face, which worsened with increasing dosage of olanzapine. Despite reduction in other psychotic symptoms, the patient continued to hold the dysmorphic delusion that her face is ugly, and unfortunately, it appeared self-validating because of the recent development of acneiform eruptions.\nThere was no history of self-mutilation, skin excoriation, hair picking, or exposure to known allergens, and hence, diagnoses of self-induced dermatosis (acne excoriation) and hypersensitivity reaction were ruled out. Her blood glucose level, autoimmune workup, thyroid, liver and renal functions were found to be within normal limits. Her menstrual cycles were regular.\nThe diagnosis of olanzapine-induced acneiform dermatosis was considered after a dermatology consultation. A cognitive behavioral therapy approach was used to tackle dysmorphic delusion. The patient was reassured about probable cosmetic adverse effects of olanzapine. Her belief was shaken slowly through a course of five therapy sessions targeting overgeneralization as a main cognitive distortion. This was accompanied by disproving her beliefs by comparing pictures and mirror reflections, reassuring about the reversibility of acneform eruptions, and video feedback with the infant. Olanzapine was continued after risk-benefit analysis and shared decision-making with patient and caregiver."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred from a secondary hospital following a major uterine rupture at 40 + 6 gestation resulting in stillbirth and bladder injury. She was expected to deliver by vaginal birth after caesarean as she already had one child that was delivered by straightforward C-section. Labour was induced at 40 weeks due to high blood pressure, but during this process, the patient reported a tearing sensation in her lower abdomen and was taken to theatre for an emergency C-section and was discovered to have a uterine rupture and intrauterine foetal death. The C-section resulted in bladder injury and right ureteric transection. Subsequently, she developed a residual vesicovaginal fistula associated with ureteric obstruction at the level of the repair, and required nephrostomy and indwelling catheter drainage (Figures and ).\nShe had vaginal VVF repair under our care. Intraoperatively, cystoscopy revealed a large oblique VVF extending over 5 cm with the right ureteric orifice not identifiable. Intraoperative nephrostogram suggested restricted drainage of contrast at the level of the right vesicoureteric junction. Via a vaginal approach, the distal ureteric orifice was circumscribed and the distal ureter mobilized. The ureteric stricture was then incised and the distal ureter resected, spatulated and reimplanted into the bladder. An anterograde guidewire was inserted through the nephrostomy into the bladder and a ureteric catheter placed over this wire to the renal pelvis. The fistula was closed with continuous polyglactin 910 3/0 suture in two layers, and modified Martius fat pad was mobilized on its posterolateral pedicle and sutured over the repair.\nAt a 1-year follow-up, the patient was complaining of flank pain, so an technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine renography (MAG3) was performed, showing good drainage but mild to moderate reflux into the reimplanted ureter. Normal bladder and sexual function were restored, and she was discharged from routine follow-up after 18 months. Following successful conception, she had a specialist obstetric review and was planned to have an elective C-section at between 37 and 38 weeks to avoid labour. Unfortunately, she had a premature vaginal delivery due to chorioamnionitis at 23 + 4 gestation complicated by sepsis with features of shock from which she and her baby made a full recovery (Figs. and ).\nAt the latest follow-up, 11 months after delivery (49 months postoperatively), she had no urinary symptoms of note and in particular none suggestive of fistula recurrence."
"A 25-year-old man brought from drug rehabilitation centre in cardiac arrest. The chest rise was poor during bag-valve-mask ventilation and extraglottic airway. Attempts to intubate the patient during chest compression by senior medical officer (experience more than 2 years) revealed Cormack-Lehane 3B. Due to the longer time it takes to intubate during cardiac compression (two attempts by same person), we applied the LeHeR manoeuvre to ventilate and intubate the patient. The vocal cord was clearly visualised with Cormack-Lehane 1, and intubation was easy during chest compression (intubated by the same person who failed to intubate on the first two attempts). However, patient did not survive."
"We present a case of a 25-year-old male who presented with complaint of clawing of his left great toe. The patient had sustained a left-sided distal tibia fracture treated with open fixation of the tibia fracture 3 years ago. The implant was removed 18 months after the procedure due to the patient’s preference. After 6 months, the patient initially noticed clawing of his left great toe when he climbed stairs barefoot. He also complained that he had started to find it difficult to sit cross-legged, squat, as well as ride his bicycle due to the tightness he felt in his toes with certain ankle movements on examination, the patient walked with a normal bipedal unassisted gait. He had well-healed surgical scars and a plantigrade foot. Active dorsiflexion of the ankle joint produced an exaggerated flexion of the great toe. With the ankle held in dorsiflexion, it was not possible for the patient to actively or passively fully extend any of the toes (Figs. and ). The diagnosis of checkrein deformity of the left great toe was made and attributed to the previous fracture of the distal tibia resulting in scarring or ischemic injury to the toe flexors. The possible patterns of injury could have been an isolated injury to FHL muscle or tendon causing fixed flexion of the great toe. The patient elected for surgical intervention and surgical exploration of FHL tendon at the level of the midfoot was planned. Exploration at the midfoot would give easier access to both tendons free from scar tissue making correction easier. The patient was suitably consented and the exploration was performed under spinal anesthetic with an inflated tourniquet at 250 mmHg. The tendon of FHL was identified (). Subsequent z-plasty of FHL tendon gave a full correction of the great toe flexion contracture (). The patient made an uncomplicated post-operative recovery and after final review, 3 months post-surgery had maintained the full range of movement in all toes (). Weight-bearing photograph is also shown before surgery () and after surgery ()."
"A 25-year-old male presented with complaints of a sudden loss of vision in his right eye (OD) since 20 days with no history of ocular trauma in the past. There was no history of retinal detachment among the family members. His best correct visual acuity (BCVA) OD was finger counting close to the face and in the left eye (OS) was 6/6. The refractive status of the left eye was –0.25 D sphere. Fundus OD showed total rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with corrugations. A nasal peripheral pigmentary CRD was evident which had wavy margins extending almost 6 clock hours resembling a coastline []. On Indentation, superior-nasal retinal dialysis was seen spanning 1 clock hour. Enclosed oral bays (EOBs) were also visible on the temporal periphery OD []. Clinically, there was no evidence of any vitreous abnormality. Fundus OS showed a similar type of CRD on the temporal periphery [Fig. and ]. On indentation, there was no evidence of any retinal dialysis. He also had a twin brother, who on fundus screening did not show any similar lesion. The patient underwent OD scleral buckling surgery. A 276 silicone tire was used during the surgery. Six weeks postoperatively OD retina was attached with a BCVA of 6/24."
"Male, 25 years old, repeated left occipital headache for half a year. Diagnosed as an\nAVM in the left parietooccipital lobe. Spetzler-Martine grade IV. We used endovascular\nintervention to embolize the nidus, which was adjacent to the visual cortex and the\nperipheral AVM nidus. This shrunk the AVM nidus and facilitated surgical resection. The\npostoperative visual field was not damaged. He scored 0 on the mRS at follow up ()."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported with a history of discomfort and pain in the left lower tooth region for the past 3 months along with difficulty in closing his mouth. On examination, there was a large yellowish hard mass extending from the distal of first molar to the retromolar region with an approximate size of 3 cm × 2 cm in diameter, which was associated with inflammation and purulent discharge [].\nOrthopantomograph [] revealed a radiopaque mass involving the embedded tooth (tooth 38) along with incomplete eruption of tooth 28. After routine blood investigations, the calcified mass was surgically removed [] under local anesthesia and sent for histochemical and biochemical study. Histochemical and biochemical examination of the specimen and salivary examination revealed the presence of calcium (42%), phosphates (18%), and calcium phosphate (70%), which was suggestive of dental calculus. The patient was recalled and educated for proper maintenance of oral hygiene and advised to report for regular follow-up []."
"Patient C was a previously healthy 25-year-old Korean woman who had palpable masses on her left breast. Ultrasonography and MRI revealed multiple infiltrative masses in her left breast that measured up to 3 cm (). Positron emission tomography revealed multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the left breast and axillary lymph nodes.\nUltrasonography-guided needle biopsy of the breast mass was performed. The lesion consisted of loosely cohesive small round cells showing solid sheet or cord-like growth patterns. The cells had scant amounts of cytoplasm and round-to-polygonal shaped hyperchromatic nuclei (). On IHC examination, these cells showed nuclear positivity for myogenin and negativity for desmin (, ). The tumors were diagnosed as embryonal RMS (eRMS) based on histological and IHC findings.\nThe patient received 5 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide) and radiation therapy; however, 8 months post-diagnosis, multiple metastatic lesions were found in bone and left upper lobe of the lung. She received additional chemotherapy but died due to adriamycin cardiotoxicity 18 months post-diagnosis."
A 25-year-old male presented with an inferior DM macroperforation (4 mm at graft–host junction) that was observed during the excision of deep stromal layer after successful big bubble formation. Fibrin glue was applied over the area of perforation prior to suturing the graft. Localized DM detachment was noted on the 1st postoperative day and reattached spontaneously within 2 days.
"A 25-year-old female with no previous medical or family history, abdominal surgery, injury or peritonitis presented to the clinic complaining of recurrent intermittent abdominal pain with dyschesia, nausea and constipation. The pain has started 2 years ago and did not respond to medication.\nPhysical examination revealed mild abdominal distension, mild tenderness in the periumbilical region, tympanites in the left side of the abdomen and no loss of weight. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a mild amount of serous fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, the abdominal X-ray (AXR) showed air-fluid levels within the transverse colon and absence of gases in the pelvis (), chest X-ray and laboratory tests were normal.\nThe patient was kept under conservative treatment (intravenous fluids, anti-vomiting and nasogastric tube) and was diagnosed with subacute intestinal obstruction.\nAfter 24 h of conservative treatment, the abdominal pain escalated with rebound tenderness in the umbilical region and no bowel movements.\nDiagnostic laparoscopy with three trocars (10-mm trocar across the umbilicus, 5-mm trocar across the right hypochondrium and 5-mm across the left hypochondrium) was performed in the front abdominal entrance under general anesthetization, and the findings were serous fluid in the pelvic cavity (100 mL).\nLaparoscopic surgery was excluded for technical and anatomical difficulties; we switched to open surgery. During intraoperative, we found malrotation (90° counterclockwise), where the small intestine was on the right side and the colons were on the left side (), and small intestine was slightly dilated and entrapped within a congenital hernia in the mesentery of the transverse colon ().\nWe extracted the small intestine from the hernia orifice and reversed it to the normal anatomical position using Ladd’s procedure. After we repositioned colons and cecum, we closed the orifice of hernia. Finally, we fixed the right colon and performed an appendectomy.\nOn the first day after surgery, there were normal intestinal movements, positive abdominal gas and an absence of nausea and vomiting. The patient was kept under intravenous fluids, analgesics and H2 histamine receptor antagonists for the first day. After 2 days of following up, the patient was doing well, and her AXR was normal."
"A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department with sudden onset paraplegia and pain in the lower extremities. His medical history included Crohn’s disease, managed with sulfasalazine. He was otherwise healthy, worked as a tradesman, and was competing in fitness championships. There was no history of trauma to the back or abdomen. Earlier in the morning, while lifting a 10 kg object at work, he experienced sudden onset of bilateral leg pain and felt the urge to defecate. While in the bathroom, he lost power in his lower extremities and was found on the floor by his coworkers. Vital signs were stable upon ambulance crew arrival. The patient presented with abdominal and bilateral leg pain in addition to numbness and paralysis of the legs. He had faecal incontinence and had soiled his clothes and the floor. During ambulance transport, he received intravenous crystalloid fluids, ondansetron and a total of 25 mg of intravenous morphine.\nOn arrival to the resuscitation room at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, the patient was still complaining of pain, now primarily localised to the perianal region, and persistent paraplegia. His vital signs were within normal range, except blood pressure that was elevated at 180/90 mm Hg. His legs were pale, cold and numb with flaccid paralysis. Femoral and distal peripheral pulses were impalpable. Sensory loss extended distally from the umbilical level, whereas examination above the umbilical level was normal. Bedside ultrasonography revealed no free intra-abdominal fluid and the aorta appeared normal. On log-rolling, there was no sign of trauma or midline tenderness on palpation of the spine. Rectal examination revealed total loss of sphincter tone and sensation in the perianal area. Bedside arterial blood gas showed metabolic acidosis with pH 7.2, base excess −13 mmol/L, lactate 6.2 mmol/L, an elevated creatinine at 155 µmol/L and otherwise unremarkable. More analgesia was given."
"Case 2: A 25-year-old female who reported a history of a sudden onset of decreased visual acuity in both eyes in January 2004. On August 12, 2017, this patient presented at our hospital for consultation. Ophthalmologic examination revealed the following: visual acuity OD 20/500 OS 20/333, a pale optic disc, sharp border, and a normal foveal reflex. LHON gene testing was positive for mtDNA G11778A (+). Final diagnosis: LHON.\nThe patient attended regular follow-up and was selected to enroll in a gene therapy trial, as she met the selection criteria [, ]. Her visual acuity was stable at OD 20/500 and OS 20/333. On January 26th, 2018, the patient underwent unilateral intravitreal injection of rAAV2-ND4 at 0.05 ml (1010vg) in the right eye. Within 2 days of undergoing gene therapy treatment, the visual acuity of the injected and uninjected eyes of the patient increased to 20/333 (1.2 LogMAR) and 20/200 (1.0 LogMAR), respectively. Within 4 days of undergoing gene therapy treatment, the visual acuity of the injected eye increased from 20/200 (1.0 LogMAR) to 20/166 (0.9 LogMAR), whereas no significant increase was observed in the uninjected eye.The patient was followed up for the first month(Right eye 20/200,Left eye 20/166) after injection. However, she was not followed up on time at the third month (Fig. )."
"25-year-old female with a previous diagnosis of NT1 presented with worsening EDS. She was previously well controlled on modafinil 100 mg twice daily. Her cataplexy episodes had already reduced in frequency and she did not require any specific treatment for it. Recently, she started working in the corporate sector and living independently. In the interim, she was diagnosed with depression and started on fluoxetine. Since then, her EDS had worsened. She also gained 10 pounds in the past 2 years. Her sleep routine was consistent, with 7 to 8 hrs of sleep, though she was unable to nap now. Her caffeine intake had also increased, and her ESS during the clinic visit was 14/24 which was up from 9/24 one year ago. On further questioning, the patient had been told that she started snoring. On physical exam, her BMI was 30 and her Modified Mallampati score was III with 2+ tonsils. The rest of the exam was unremarkable. The patient was screened for OSA with a PSG. She was diagnosed with moderate OSA and was initiated on CPAP while she continued on modafinil. After 3 months of CPAP usage, she returned to clinic for re-evaluation. She had excellent compliance with > 4 hrs usage of 90% and residual AHI of 1/hr. Her EDS had improved and her ESS was 8/24. This case demonstrates that other causes of EDS should be re-evaluated in patients presenting with worsening of the previously well-controlled symptoms of narcolepsy. Note: This case is a mock case used to highlight points raised in the review."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with high-grade fever (38.9°C) and flank pain for 3 days. She did not have dysuria. She had been treated with oral antibiotics for the same complaints several days earlier. She had costovertebral angle tenderness. Her laboratory investigations demonstrated leukocytosis (12 800/µL), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 215 mg/L) and positive nitrites in the urine with 40 to 50 leukocytes per high-power field. The admission diagnosis was APN. Abdominal ultrasound () demonstrated a hyperechoic area at the upper pole of the right kidney with mild perinephric fluid and hypoperfusion in the same area by power Doppler (). Based on these imaging findings and the prolonged febrile period, AFBN was suspected and subsequently confirmed by CECT which revealed a wedge-shaped area with decreased enhancement (). The patient’s condition improved with meropenem treatment. Urine and blood cultures isolated an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli. Therefore, we deescalated to ertapenem. The advantages of the latter include its convenience as a single daily-dose outpatient therapy and its excellent perfusion in the kidney. shows the gradual improvement after 2 weeks and 24 days of antibiotic therapy ().\nA 27-year-old woman presented with high-grade fever (39.4°C) and back pain with dysuria for 5 days, headache, and nausea. Clinically, she had mild right costovertebral angle tenderness.\nHer laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated CRP (275 mg/L), leukocytosis (20 400/µL), and pyuria. The admission diagnosis was APN, and the patient was started on ceftriaxone. Kidney ultrasound showed a right renal upper pole mass-like lesion with mild perinephric fluid. A CECT was obtained after 48 hours of persistent fever with rising CRP (303 mg/L), revealing multifocal wedge-shaped lesions (). Urine and blood cultures were negative. The patient’s condition improved rapidly after starting meropenem. The typical CECT lesions in a highly septic patient and the fear of ESBL-producing pathogen confined to the kidney justified the use of meropenem which was followed by ertapenem as outpatient therapy. Complete resolution of the lesions was obtained after 3 weeks of treatment ()."
"A 25-year-old female presented with itching in the left eye. She was referred as a case of fungal corneal ulcer and was on treatment for the same. There was a history of trauma to left eye 10 years ago and she had undergone an ocular surgery 5 years ago, but details of procedure were not available. On examination, the visual acuity in the right eye was 6/6 while the left eye had no perception of light. In the left eye, the lids and adnexa were normal with presence of diffuse blackish pigmentation over the cornea admixed with multiple yellowish deposits []. Anterior-chamber details were not visible. Posterior segment could not be evaluated. The right eye was grossly within normal limits."
"A 25-year-old male with a 7-year history of atopic dermatitis was referred to our dermatological service because he had developed a big size bald circumscribed patch on the scalp for the past 10 months. Atopic dermatitis was treated with topical steroids, narrow-band ultraviolet B, and oral corticosteroids, without lasting response. Dermatological examination revealed atopic dermatitis (eczema area and severity index [EASI] 7) and bald patches with yellow dots in the dermoscopy in the parieto-occipital area that made us consider the diagnosis of AA monolocularis (SALT 7,6). Treatment with oral apremilast off-label was started. After 8 weeks of treatment, complete hair regrowth was observed with a significant improvement in atopic dermatitis (EASI 3,5)."
"A 25-year-old female underwent an attempted big bubble DALK to treat keratoconus in her left eye. Intraoperatively, an unsalvageable perforation occurred and the procedure was converted to a penetrating keratoplasty (PK). At the 6-week postoperative follow-up, a well-defined anterior stromal scar was detected in the donor cornea upon slit lamp examination [], which was subsequently confirmed by anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) []. As the patient's left BCVA was 6/9, the decision was made to manage conservatively and observe. Initial screening of the donor, including a donor risk assessment interview, did not reveal any significant findings nor did a review of the donor's medical history. The endothelial cell density of donor cornea was 3200 cells/mm2 and was PK Grade tissue with donor age being 21 yrs."
"A 25-year-old unmarried male laborer presented with fever, dry cough, exertion dyspnea, and left-sided chest pain for the last 6 months. The fever was of low grade and relieved by antipyretics. The cough was gradually progressive and lacked any associated expectoration. The left-sided chest pain was localized and dull-aching and responded favorably to analgesics. His medical history was unremarkable for major illness or surgery as was his personal history negative for any addiction. His general examination was within normal limits. Chest inspection revealed right-sided tracheal shifting while palpation additionally demonstrated shifting of the apex beat to the right side. A stony dull note was appreciated on percussion over the left hemithorax along with decreased air entry. As such, a Stony dull note is indicative of pleural effusion.\nRoutine blood investigations were within normal limits, and the chest X-ray revealed a homogeneous opacity left hemithorax with contralateral shifting of the mediastinum []. Chest X-ray posteroanterior view and examination findings were suggestive of massive pleural effusion. Differential diagnoses of massive pleural effusion are bronchogenic carcinoma, metastatic malignancy, mesothelioma, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism, etc.[] Thoracocentesis was performed under aseptic precaution, which revealed a purulent aspirate. A provisional diagnosis of left-sided empyema was made, and empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated. Presence of dyspnea, mediastinal shifting to opposite hemithorax, and aspiration of pus all mandated intercostal drainage (ICD) was aptly performed. The microscopic examination of pus (Gram stain and AFB) was negative, while cultures also were sterile for any organisms. Neither was any abnormal parasitic cyst reported.\nThe patient's dyspnea responded well and the output from the ICD became minimal without considerable change in the appearance of the chest X-ray. A computed tomography (CT) thorax was done which showed a single, large rounded cyst in the left lung surrounded by multiple small, rounded cysts that appeared like a necklace []. ICD was clamped and taken out. An ultrasound-guided thoracocentesis revealed a clear aspirate which on microscopic examination revealed hooklets of Echinococcus []. A diagnosis of left-sided multiple hydatid cysts with superadded infection was entertained. The diagnosis was further confirmed by the demonstration of raised serum IgG for Echinococcus. The patient was started on albendazole 15 mg/kg/day twice daily and referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon for removal of the cyst."
"A 25-year-old female was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology Department of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, Iran) for evaluation of the painless expansion on the right side of the face. Intraoral examination revealed a swelling in the posterior area of right mandible. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy and the laboratory data was unremarkable. The panoramic radiograph revealed a well-defined corticated multilocular radiolucent lesion with coarse and curved internal septa in the right side of the mandible from first premolar to ramus with root resorption of 45, 46 measuring 5cm×2cm (). Given the radiographic feature, the diagnosis of ameloblastoma was considered. To make a final diagnosis, incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia.\nThe specimen demonstrated a cystic white and homogenous cut surface. It was processed for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histopathologic study.\nMicroscopic examination showed a cystic lesion lined by granular cell epithelium. The fibrous wall of the cyst is infiltrated by multiple islands, nests,\ncords, and sheets of neoplastic epithelial cells with abundant, finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei embedded in a densely\ncollagenized stroma. Cystic changes in solid nests were also evident. Mitotic activity or cellular atypia was not found\n(-).\nAt first glance, these microscopic features reminiscent of oncocytic neoplasm such as intraosseous oncocytic mucoepidermoid carcinoma. However,\nsome peripheral cells of the oncocytic nests revealed reverse polarity and there was a subtle stellate reticulum in some islands. Serial sections showed\nthe presence of conventional follicular ameloblastoma. Immunohistochemical staining for P63 and Ki-67 was performed. All the peripheral and central cells\nof the neoplastic islands were positive with P63 (). The Ki-67 cell proliferation index was found to be\nabout 1-2% (). Due to these microscopic features, diagnosis of granular cell mural ameloblastoma was performed.\nThe patient referred for enblock resection. Clinical follow-up was done after radical surgery and the patient was free of tumor for 1 year postoperatively."
"A 25-year-old female student started to have right knee pain while jumping and landing in flexed knee 3 months ago. Thermotherapy, electrotherapy, therapeutic ultrasound, therapeutic exercises, and medicine had been prescribed but not satisfactory. She still felt some pain, weakness, and give-away sensation while walking or climbing stairs at the time she came to our clinic. Physical examination demonstrated positive findings of Lachman test and anterior drawer test. Right knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) partial tear with poor collagen alignment but still consistent between femur and tibia insertion. Several small enhancements and irregular architecture over ACL tibial plateau insertion and its main trunk, which indicated partial ACL tear [Figure and ].\nFour months after the insult, three times of Regenlab platelet-rich plasma (PRP) (Regen Lab SA, Switzerland) injection through ultrasound guidance were applied over ACL torn region, including ACL insertion site and its main trunk []. In each course, 2.5 cc PRP (3400 rpm centrifugation, 3–4 times concentrated platelets without the red blood cells) was prepared. The patient lied in the supine position with right knee flexion at 90°. The 10 MHz linear transducer was placed parallel to patellar tendon with the proximal end rotated counterclockwise in 30° to clarify the insertion of both anteromedial and posterolateral bundles over tibial plateau. The three times of injections were performed by the same physician through out-of-plane approach with frequency of once per 3 weeks []. During intervention, the patient kept thermotherapy, electrotherapy, and exercise training. Six months after finishing PRP injection, postintervention MRI revealed decreased enhancements of ACL tear in the tibial plateau area and its main trunk [Figure and ]. The patient felt less pain with visual analog scale of pain decreased from 10 to 2, and the stability was improved while walking."
"A 25-year-old male reported to the hospital with an alleged history of road traffic accident and history of loss of consciousness and nasal bleed. The patient was conscious, stable, and oriented. The patient presented with a laceration wound measuring approximately 5 cm × 3 cm in the left forehead region running parallel to the eyebrow [], which was debrided immediately and sutured to control bleeding. Diffuse edema of the left upper and middle third of the face was evident along with circumorbital edema and subconjunctival hemorrhage of the left eye. The patient's mouth opening was adequate with bilaterally stable occlusion. Assessment of the computed tomography [] revealed an incomplete and undisplaced Le Fort I fracture and a left frontal bone fracture which was approximately 3 cm × 2.5 cm × 1 cm. The frontal bone fracture involved both the cortices without involvement of the frontal sinus, and there was no evidence of dural tear as discussed with the neurosurgical team. The patient was observed for any neurosurgical deficit and was found to be devoid of the same. Since the patient's mouth opening was adequate, occlusion was stable with no mobility of the maxilla, and the Le Fort I fracture was decided to be managed conservatively. The frontal bone was minimally depressed without involvement of the frontal sinus; therefore; bone cement was used as an alternate to the standard approach based on esthetic concerns.\nThe existing laceration was utilized to approach the fracture site []. The fracture site was exposed [] and isolated. A calcium phosphate-based cement[] (HydroSet™) which is a synthetic bone graft substitute was used in the reconstruction of the depressed frontal bone fracture. The bone cement [] consisted of powder and liquid components, was mixed to attain a flowable consistency and then was applied over the defect and was manipulated. The cement was designed to set in the presence of water, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Once the cement had set, closure was done in layers with Vicryl 3-0 and ethilon 4-0 [].\nThe patient was assessed postoperatively [] for any pain, edema or bleeding at the surgical site. A postoperative computed tomography [] was done to evaluate the adaptation and contour of the bone cement placed over the defect."
"A 25-year-old man attends your department after a crush injury to his left foot sustained at work. X-rays reveal undisplaced fourth and fifth metatarsal neck fractures. The orthopaedic team advise a walking boot and to allow partial weight bearing as tolerated until outpatient review later that week. On further assessment, the patient has no other medical history and no family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). He takes no medications. Despite analgesia in the department, he remains unable to put any weight through the affected limb."
"The second patient was a 25-year-old white female with a history of anxiety disorder, and TTM first diagnosed. The patient presented to the pharmacy care clinic for baseline assessment of her TTM. A review of her prescription medications included only trazodone 50 mg by mouth daily. Her baseline labs included a thyroid function study, general chemistry, and urinalysis, all of which were unremarkable. Her 25-hydroxy vitamin D level was under 5 ng/mL indicating a severe vitamin D deficiency due to unknown cause. She was subsequently started on vitamin D3 1000 IU and clomipramine 25 mg by mouth daily. The patient was followed over the course of 3 months, and the MGH Hair-Pulling scale was administered at each visit. The clomipramine was not titrated and remained at a dose of 25 mg during the 3 months. Over the course of 3 visits, the patient demonstrated marked improvement based on MGH Hair-Pulling Scale scores, specifically with a reduction in the urge to pull hair (C) and improved hair regrowth in the occipital ridge of the scalp ( and B). Her 25-hydroxy vitamin D level increased to 32 ng/mL, 3 months after baseline visit."
"We report a case of a 25-year-old man complaining of primary infertility for 2 years. He had a history of two failed attempts of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) utilizing surgically retrieved sperms through testicular sperm aspiration. The patient was known to have asthma; otherwise, no significant medical history was reported. Examination revealed that he was obese with a body mass index of 41.29 kg/m2. He had a normal-sized left testis (18 mL) but no vas deferens. He had an atrophied right testis (10 mL) with a palpable vas deferens.\nRenal ultrasound showed left renal agenesis. Semen analysis was performed, which showed low semen volume (0.5 mL) with azoospermia.\nTo increase the sperm count, we planned scrotal exploration and a transseptal vasoepididymostomy[] to relocate the vas deferens to the left testes with intraoperative sperm retrieval. During the scrotal exploration, the left testis was exposed, it was normal in size with no vas deferens, and the epididymis was hypoplastic. The left mini-microsurgical sperm retrieval was performed, and the specimen was sent to the in vitro fertilization laboratory; the specimen was positive for the presence of sperms. The right testis was then exposed, which was small in size with a small epididymis, and was detached (dissociated from the testis). The vas deferens was palpated and transacted at the area of the straight vas deferens. We pulled the vas through the right-sided tunica vaginalis, through the dartos intertesticular septum, and through the left tunica vaginalis as we opened the window using the diathermy.\nThe patient was then discharged home after 24 h in good and stable. He was prescribed augmentin 1 g tablet every 12 h orally for 7 days and acetaminophen 1 g orally every 6 h for the pain for 10 days. After 3 months, semen analysis showed a picture of cryptozoospermia and the sperms were utilized in a cycle of ICSI. After 6 months, the sperm concentration reached 5 × 106/mL with good motility (40%) and volume (1.5 mL). Twelve months later, the patient had his first child."
"A 25-year-old, gravida 2 nulliparous woman was referred to our center for fetal detailed evaluation at 12 weeks of gestation, following routine ultrasound screening because of progressive early grow restriction detected in the first trimester (Fig.).\nThe patient and family history were negative for genetic syndromes or congenital malformations, and there was no history of medication use during pregnancy.\nThe combined test revealed low risk for Trisomies 21, 18 and 13 (1:440, 1:3500 and 1:1900, respectively), 0.22 multiples of median (MoMs) of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCGb) and 0.07 MoMs of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), normal nuchal translucency thickness, nasal bone present, normal tricuspid and ductus venosus flows (Fig.) and increased fronto-maxillary angle (86°).\nUltrasound transabdominal visualization of the fetus anatomy was severely impaired because of the oligohydramnios and vertical and hyperflexed position of the fetus (Fig.).\nThus, the completion of the structural protocol was achieved only using transvaginal approach.\nOn detailed examination, it was noted asymmetrical severe growth restriction less the 3rd percentile, with increased ratio between the head parameters and abdominal circumference, ventriculomegaly, a posterior fossa cyst with abnormal posterior brain appearance, single umbilical artery and pyelectasis, short limbs with clenched fists and overlapping fingers, clubfoot, and cranio-facial dysmorphism with enlarged head, low-set ears, hypertelorism and micrognathia (Fig.).\nChoroid plexus cysts were not present.\nEchocardiography showed normal segmental anatomy of the heart and great vessels, but reduced ventricular contractility and unusually large, irregular and multiple echogenic foci in both ventricles (Fig.).\nDoppler imaging demonstrated normal functional parameters (atrio-ventricular and ventriculo-arterial flows, tricuspid, mitral and ductus venosus flows and heart rate).\nSince the first trimester scan revealed anomalies, invasive genetic maneuver was proposed and accepted after counseling, although the combined test yield low genetic risks.\nChorionic villus sampling was performed at 13 weeks+5 days.\nThe blood tests showed normal parameters, including a negative TORCH screen. The karyotype results revealed triploidy, and pregnancy was terminated at patients request following genetic counselling.\nThe pathology evaluation confirmed ultrasound findings (Fig.).\nA written informed consent of the patient was obtained for publication of all the data."
"The present case report is about a 25-year-old female patient who reported to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery with swelling in the right lower third of face below the lower border of mandible since 6 months []. Recently, the swelling had suddenly increased in size with severe pain from the past 3 days. On examination, it was associated with infected molar, which was assumed to be the etiology of the swelling, for which extraction was carried out. After extraction, the pain subsided, however, the swelling was persistent and had not completely resolved even after a month. During the follow-up visit, the lesion was soft, non-tender and compressible and it measured 5 × 4 cm in size approximately. The skin over the swelling had normal texture and consistency. No bruits were heard on auscultation. The patient informed us that the swelling intermittently increased and decreased in size and has reached the present size. The growth although painless was cosmetically disfiguring.\nOn investigation, needle aspiration yielded a blood-tinged clear fluid which resembled lymphatic fluid, which was examined in light microscopy. After a routine blood investigations, the patient was advised an orthopantomograph which failed to reveal any bony changes. Later on, the patient was advised to undergo an ultrasonographic scan which revealed a multicystic lesion with internal septations. A computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast was carried out, which revealed a multicystic, homogeneous, non-invasive lesion with low attenuation.\nThe lesion was provisionally diagnosed as a lymphatic malformation and incisional biopsy was planned. A 5-cm extraoral incision was placed in the first cervical crease. Blunt and sharp dissection was carried out to free the lesion from the overlying platysma muscle. Once the lesion was identified, aspiration of some content of the cyst was carried out to reduce the size of the lesion. Blunt dissection was carried out to protect vital structures of the neck. The medial part of the lesion extended up to the pharyngeal wall as per ultrasound and blunt dissection was carried out until the lesion was free from surrounding tissue []. The lesion was excised fully and the floor was examined for any perforations of the pharyngeal wall []. The surgical wound was cleaned and debrided and sutured in layers. After the surgery, the patient recovered well without any complications.\nThe lesion was sent for histopathologic examination which revealed large dilated lymphatic vessels filled with light eosinophilic proteinaceous fluid which confirmed the final diagnosis as lymphangioma. Post-operative follow-up after 1 month showed a good cosmetic healing of the surgical scar []."
"A 25 y/o single woman with chronic hepatitis B diagnosed from 1 year ago presented with symptoms of depression. She had complaints of malaise, hopelessness, sadness, loss of energy, and social withdrawal. Beck depression inventory revealed moderate depression (score of 36). She underwent individual solution- focused therapy for 5 sessions, each session 1 hour once a week. At the end of therapy, she got better and stated decreasing of pretreatment symptoms, including hopelessness, insomnia, sadness, anhedonia, loss of energy, crying and aggression. Beck depression inventory showed mild depression (score of 20)."
"A 25-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Periodontology, H.K.E's S. Nijalingappa Institute of Dental Sciences and Research, Gulbarga (India) with a chief complaint of a excessive display of gums. There was no significant medical or family history and the patient was medically sound and fit for the surgical procedure. On clinical examination extraorally, the face was bilaterally symmetrical with incompetent lips. A severe gingival display was seen during smiling which extended from the maxillary right second premolar to the maxillary left second premolar []. A diagnosis of moderate vertical maxillary excess with hypermobility of upper lip was made. As the patient preferred a less invasive procedure to address her chief complaint, an informed consent was obtained after discussing the alternate treatment modalities, benefits, and possible complications for a lip repositioning procedure.\nComplete extraoral and intraoral mouth disinfection was carried out, and the surgical site was anesthetized between the first maxillary molars. The local infiltration was administered in the buccal vestibule, with additional infiltration for hemostasis purposes. The surgical area was demarcated with sterile pencil on dried tissue []. The partial thickness incision was started at the mucogingival junction extending from right first molar to left first molar. A second parallel incision was made at the facial mucosa at approximately 13-15 mm distance from the first incision. The two incisions were connected to create an elliptical outline []. After these incisions were made, the epithelium was excised [] leaving the underlying connective tissue exposed [].\nThe tissue tags were removed. The mucosal flap was advanced and sutured at the mucogingival junction. First, interrupted suture was placed at the midline to ensure proper alignment of the lip midline with the midline of the teeth [], then continuous interlocking sutures were used to approximate both flaps []. Due to short anatomical crown length, crown lengthening was not advisable. Pressure pack was applied for hemostasis []. Postoperative instructions included placing ice packs over the upper lip for several hours, limited facial movements for 1 -week, no brushing around the surgical site for 14 days. The patient was advised to rinse gently with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate twice daily for 2 weeks. Postoperative pain was managed with analgesics.\nAt 1-week post operative, uneventful healing pattern was seen []. After 2 months of healing, a scar formation was observed []. Follow-up examinations revealed reduced gingival display [Figures and ]. Our results indicate good stability at the 1-year follow up."
"A 25-year-old male presented to us with asymptomatic dark-colored lesions on his hands and feet and light-colored skin lesions involving the trunk since three years. The dark-colored lesions increased progressively in number to involve other parts of his body. There was no history of similar complaints in the family and he was not a product of consanguinity.\nDermatological examination revealed mildly atrophic, hyperpigmented macules in a reticulate pattern involving the dorsa of the hands and feet [Figure and ], front and sides of neck, and axillae [Figure and ]. In addition, he had similar lesions on the periorbital region [], groin, and scrotum []. He also had multiple hypopigmented macules widely distributed over the trunk and anterior aspect of both legs []. Multiple pits were present over both palms, with breaks in dermatoglyphics. He also had multiple nonacne facial scars predominantly on the nose and malar areas [].\nSkin biopsy from a hyperpigmented lesion on the dorsum of the hand revealed filiform elongation of rete ridges with hyperpigmentation of basilar keratinocytes and clusters of melanocytes at the tip of the rete ridges. Histopathology axillary lesion was also similar except for features of follicular plugging [Figure and ]. Melan-A stain confirmed increased melanocytes []; skin biopsy from hypopigmented lesion on left leg revealed decreased melanocytes []."
"A 25-year-old woman (G3P0L0) with 39 weeks amenorrhea, diagnosed with SLE was scheduled for elective caesarean section in view of cephalopelvic disproportion. Her obstetric history revealed that she had two consecutive abortions and had no live issues. Because of secondary infertility and cervicitis, intrauterine insemination was done 9 months back. Patient had a history of easy fatiguability. On examination, she had mild pallor and pedal oedema.\nDuring antenatal checkups, she was investigated in view of bad obstetric history and a diagnosis of SLE was made. She was found to be ANA (antinuclear antibody) positive but negative for antiphospholipid antibody, although there was no history suggestive of any systemic involvement. Her complete blood count (CBC), blood sugar, urine examination were normal. Liver and renal function tests (LFT, RFT), electrocardiograph (ECG) were further ordered to rule out any systemic involvement and were found to be normal.\nTo improve the foetal outcome, she was receiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 2500 IU subcutaneously twice daily. She was being monitored by serial bleeding time (BT), clotting time (CT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) measurements. In view of bad obstetric history and precious pregnancy, an elective caesarean section was planned at term. Injection LMWH was withheld 24 h prior to surgery. Preoperative investigations revealed a normal BT, CT, APTT and PT, INR.\nPatient was shifted to the operation theatre. In view of normal coagulation profile, regional anaesthesia was planned. 18G iv line was secured and patient was preloaded with 500 ml of Ringer lactate. Vital monitoring was carried out through oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure and ECG and Foleys catheter was placed to measure hourly urine output. Subarachnoid neuraxial block was performed using 2 ml of 0.5% Bupivacaine (heavy) in lateral position with 25G Quincke needle under aseptic precautions. Blockade was achieved at T6 dermatome level. Baby cried immediately after birth with normal APGAR score and no signs of neonatal lupus. Inj. oxytocin 20IU in 500 ml DNS was started. The surgery was uneventful with minimal blood loss. After full recovery patient was shifted to the ward and LMWH injections were restarted after 24 h."
"A 25-year-old male was referred to us with a 10-day history of decreased vision in the left eye after cataract surgery elsewhere. There was no history of diabetes or ocular trauma.\nInitial examination revealed a visual acuity of counting finger close to face in left eye and 20/30 in right eye. The anterior segment in right eye revealed aphakia after being operated for steroid-induced cataract elsewhere and in left eye showed 3 mm hypopyon and intraocular lens. Cornea was clear. Vitreous cavity was hazy with no view of the retina in left eye. Ultrasonography showed multiple moderate to high reflective echoes with attached retina.\nHe was a known case of bronchial asthma and was on irregular treatment of steroids. He was diagnosed to be a case of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis at our institute on the basis of diagnostic criteria for diagnosing ABPA.[] His total white blood cell count was 19000/cmm. Differential leukocyte count revealed raised eosinophil count. Serum Ig E levels were 145 IU/ml.[] ESR was 58 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein was 1 mg/L. Wheal-and-flare skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen was positive. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Serology for HIV and VDRL was negative. Chest X-ray revealed wedge-shaped pleural-based densities.\nDiagnostic and therapeutic pars plana vitrectomy was done on the second day of presentation. Vitreous aspirate showed moderate number of neutrophils, branching septate hyphae and no bacteria on Gram stain []. KOH mount revealed brancing septate hyphae. Intravitreal voriconazole 50 microgram/0.1 ml was given. The culture for bacteria was negative, but Sabouraud's agar grew A. flavus.\nHe was put on topical voriconazole (10 mg/ml) drops one-hourly, and oral Itraconazole 200 mg twice-a-day was given for 6 wks. Oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/bodyweight and topical prednisolone 1% were started in tapering doses. Two weeks post-vitrectomy BCVA in left eye was 20/50, anterior segment showed no activity []. Retina was attached. One-month postoperative visual acuity improved to 20/30 in left eye. Fundus examination showed posterior vitreous detachment and a horseshoe tear in superonasal quadrant. Barrage laser was done for the same. After 1 month, his vision dropped to 20/70 and fundus showed a partial rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. He underwent revitrectomy with Belt Buckle with 360 degree Endolaser with silicone oil insertion. One-week post-operative showed attached retina []. Two months post-surgery vision improved to 20/30. He was followed every month for 1 year, during which no complications developed. After Silicone oil removal, his BCVA is 20/30."
"A healthy 25-year-old Caucasian female presented 2 months postpartum complaining of a mass above her right eye. She first noticed it when she was 6 months pregnant and it had progressively enlarged. The patient reported mild tenderness to palpation. The forehead and scalp had normal sensation to touch. It was the patient's first pregnancy and she was breastfeeding. The patient denied a history of trauma. Examination revealed a freely mobile 1 × 1 cm firm, solitary nodule above the superomedial aspect of the right orbital rim. The surrounding tissue was not adherent and the overlying skin was unremarkable. There were no other lesions or lymphadenopathy. A computed tomography (CT) scan examination of the orbits showed a rounded, soft-tissue mass in the subcutaneous soft tissue at the right supraorbital notch []. There was no associated osseous defect and no intraorbital, sinus or other extension identified.\nThe nodule was completely excised and the surgical site closed primarily. Histopathological examination revealed a slightly irregular unencapsulated mass with monomorphic spindle-shaped cells. They were arranged in interlacing fascicles with occasional storiform pattern in a myxoid stroma []. Mitoses were infrequent and scattered throughout the lesion with no atypical mitoses. There were numerous fine capillaries with scattered collections of extravasated lymphocytes and red blood cells present. The tumor cells stained positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and vimentin. They stained negative for S100 and estrogen and progesterone receptors."
"The present case report is about a 25-year-old Hispanic female with a history of depression since age of 12 years, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, purging type bulimia and history of suicide attempts at age 12 was admitted to the intensive care unit after attempted suicide by consuming an unknown number of VPA pills. This patient had recently started taking VPA (Depakote®) as a mood stabilizer at a dose of 250 mg at bed time about 3 days earlier, after a failed therapy. VPA was started 4 days after she discontinued topiramate. Patient was taking paroxetine 20 mg for depression; this was incremented to 40 mg at the time VPA was started. She reported that the change to VPA made her listless, “lowered” her mood, decreased her motivation, worsened her depression and caused suicidal thoughts. She overdoses herself on VPA which she took with alcohol. After ingesting the pills she notified her family who then brought her to the emergency room. On admission, her vitals were stable (blood pressure: 118/72 mm Hg; temperature: 98.7°F; pulse: 82 beats/min; oxygen saturation: 99% on room air). On initial examination she looked disheveled, although drowsy, was oriented to person, place and time. No focal neurological deficits, abnormal cardiologic or respiratory signs were found. Her abdomen was soft, non-distended and non-tender. Her electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel that was recorded initially and subsequently were unremarkable []. The initial VPA and ammonia levels were elevated []. Patient was administered activated charcoal and one dose of haloperidol 5 mg intramuscularly. Subsequently, she was administered oral lactulose once and then 1400 mg of levocarnitine orally every 6 h for the next 2 days. Her VPA levels which peaked after admission continued to trend down over the next 4 days, the ammonia levels also peaked subsequent to admission then showed an initial dip followed by a very slow down-trend []. The normalized log-linear plot of VPA serum concentration over time showed a down-trending linear first-order kinetics with a calculated t½ =15.08 h [] (expected t½ for Depakote®: 9-16 h following oral dosing regimens of 250-1000 mg.[] The serum ammonia normalized log-linear plot in contrast showed two different decay kinetics: initial sharp down-trend for VPA levels greater than 90.9 μg/mL but much slower downtrend for VPA levels less than 90.9 μg/mL down into the subtherapeutic range of 8.5 μg/mL. Patient continued to complain of lethargy for the next 4 days which subsequently alleviated. At 14 days the patient was asymptomatic and her ammonia levels found to be normal (<35 μmol/L)."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to our ophthalmology clinic with a long history of progressive protrusion of bilateral eyes and periorbital swelling without vision changes. Her symptoms started when she was 9 years old, but she had no history of treatment or operation because of poor conditions of her country. She denied history of a blow or other injuries to the orbit. She had intermittent attacks of retrobulbar pain and headache. Clinical examination revealed protrusion of both eyes with bilateral conjunctival congestion, restrictive eye movements, and periorbital and facial swelling, more so on the right. Anterior chambers were clear and vision was normal. Routine laboratory and hematologic investigations including T3, T4, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were normal. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. Doppler ultrasound (USG) showed increased soft-tissue thickness in the periorbital region with arterial and venous flow inside. A vascular malformation was suspected and patient underwent routine and contrast-enhanced orbital MRI []. Exophthalmos and hypertelorism were present. Edematous contrast-enhancing soft-tissue thickening was noted in both orbits as well as in buccal and zygomatic regions. In the orbits, pre- and post-septal structures were extensively affected, sparing the optic nerve dural sheaths and bulbi oculi on both sides. Extraocular muscles were thickened and enhancing brightly. Infiltrative changes were more prominent on the right. Due to multispatial appearances, vascular malformation Graves’ disease was suspected. However, hypointensity seen on T2 image indicated infiltrative changes and ruled out Graves’ disease. Additional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences were taken. Diffusion restriction was noted in the massively infiltrated areas. Extensions into paranasal sinuses, middle cranial fossa, and cavernous sinuses were not present. Massive orbital and maxillofacial infiltrating disease with T2 hypointensity, diffusion restriction, and multispatial appearance were suggestive of either lymphoproliferative diseases (orbital pseudotumor, eosinophilic tumor, histiocytic tumor, Langerhans cell tumor, periorbital xantogranulomatous diseases) or sarcoidosis. A biopsy was taken from the left upper eyelid for definitive diagnosis. Histopathologic examination showed a chronic lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with orbital pseudotumor. Patient was treated with oral corticosteroids in tapering dose for 3 months. At the end of treatment, periorbital swelling and redness, and proptosis of eyes resolved to a great extent."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with fever and bleeding gums of three weeks duration. The clinical examination was normal except for a body temperature of 38.5°C. Systemic examination revealed no abnormality.\nHematological investigations showed hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dl, platelet count 200000/mm3; white blood cell count of 2900/mm3, differential count 30% blast cells, 6% neutrophils, 64% lymphocytes. Coagulation profile was normal. D-dimer was 10000 ng/ml. Serum biochemistry showed lactate dehydrogenase 566 U/L, peripheral smear showed normocytic normochromic anemia, reduced total count with predominant lymphocytes with atypical cells and adequate platelet count. Bone marrow examination showed 84% blasts which were peroxidase positive with moderate cytoplasm indented to bilobed nuclei with immature chromatin. Flow cytometry was suggestive of acute myeloid leukemia – M3 with CD13, CD33, CD64, CD117, CD45 positivity and negative HLA DR. Real time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) qualitative analysis revealed the presence of typical fusion transcript PML-RARa (bcr1type) in the cells. Chromosomal analysis carried out using bone marrow showed 50% with 46XX; t (15;17) and 50% with 46XX. Detection of translocation t (15;17) by FISH using bone marrow showed PML-RARA fusion signal in 90% of interphase cells.\nThe patient was started on treatment with ATRA 45 mg/m2 p.o. (80 mg/day) plus daunorubicin 100 mg/day for four days. After three weeks of induction chemotherapy, the patient started complaining of headache and diplopia. Neurological examination was non contributory. Fundus examination showed bilateral papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal. Cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal except for an elevated CSF pressure. Thus a diagnosis of PTC was made. ATRA was stopped and the patient was started on anti cerebral edema measures and steroids. Headache and diplopia subsided in two weeks. ATRA was restarted after one week. The patient achieved complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy without any neurological sequela."
"A 25-year-old young man presented with recurrent right upper abdominal pain for 18 months. Abdominal sonography revealed cholelithiasis, a normal biliary tree, cavernous transformation of the portal vein, splenomegaly and significant peri-portal and peri-pancreatic venous collaterals. Upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy showed grade 2 oesophageal varices. Haematological, coagulation and liver profiles were normal except for raised serum alkaline phosphatase (437 IU/L) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase - 1329.3 U/L levels. Magnetic resonance cholangio pancreaticograpy (MRCP) revealed mild extrinsic compression of the mid common bile duct (CBD) and no biliary dilatation."
"A 25-year-old, gravida 3, para 2, pregnant woman, presented with a painless mass over left labia majora since 3 months. The patient’s history revealed menarche at the age of twelve years with regular menstrual cycle of 3-4 days duration having an average flow. Her family and past history was not significant. Local examination revealed a non-tender, pedunculated mass measuring 8×6×5 cm, attached to left labia majora by a 2.5 cm long stalk. Ultrasound abdomen showed single live fetus with gestation age of 18 weeks 4 days. The mass was clinically presumed to be lipoma and was completely excised under caudal block and was sent for histopathological examination.\nOn gross examination of the specimen, skin covered oval pedunculated mass measuring 8×6×5 cm in size, with the stalk measuring 2.5 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter was identified (). The cut surface was solid, gray-white, glistening, and soft in consistency with no areas of necrosis and hemorrhage ().\nMicroscopic examination revealed a non-encapsulated but relatively well-circumscribed, hypocellular neoplasm composed of widely dispersed, uniform population of spindle to stellate cells with round to oval bland nuclei in abundant loose myxoid matrix. The blood vessels of variable caliber were seen throughout the tumor (). No cellular pleomorphism, mitosis or necrosis was observed. Resection margin was free of tumor. Based on histopathological findings, final diagnosis of an aggressive angiomyxoma of vulva was made."
"The present case report is about a 25-year-old male patient who reported to the dental clinic for a routine dental check-up. The patient's medical history was non-contributory. No abnormalities were noted on general examination. On intraoral examination, a TC was seen projecting from the facial surface of the crown of mandibular left central incisor extending from the cervical aspect of the crown to the incisal edge [].\nBrownish extrinsic stains with stagnation of the debris were noticed on either side of the TC. It was not associated with caries and there was no evidence of loss of vitality of the tooth. No periapical changes were noticed intra-oral periapical radiograph revealed an inverted V-shaped radiopaque structure originating from the cervical third of the root, superimposed over the crown of the mandibular left central incisor []. Since the patient was clinically asymptomatic except for the stagnation of debris and the stains it was decided to do a prophylactic enameloplasty of the TC to avoid the future complication. This was followed by topical application of desensitizing agent (potassium nitrate in the paste form) and fluoride to reduce the sensitivity and stimulate reparative dentine formation for pulp protection respectively. Regular clinical and radiographic follow-up was advised."
Case 4: A 25-year-old female presented with headache with no focal deficits on examination. Imaging showed PIVH and DSA revealed bilateral MMD with posterior circulation affection [].
"A 25-year-old lady with no significant medical history including allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma was admitted to a tertiary care hospital of South India because of recalcitrant erosive lesions on her oral mucosa and lip that had begun 3 months earlier. The patient was treated for Steven Johnson syndrome in a private hospital with steroids prior to the admission. On admission, there were extensive erosions in the oral mucosa and tongue with thick hemorrhagic crusts on the lip [] and erosive lesions over labia majora. Cutaneous and conjunctival lesions were not evident at that point of time. Histological examination of a biopsy taken from a violaceous, indurated lesion of the lower lip showed a band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes throughout the papillary dermis, hydropic degeneration of basal keratinocytes, and necrotic keratinocytes within the hypertrophic epidermis. Skin biopsy was suggestive of interface dermatitis suggestive of pemphigus vulgaris []. Anti Nuclear Antibody was negative. HIV was non-reactive by ELISA. Biopsy from un-involved buccal mucosa for direct immunofluorescence was negative for antibodies. During hospital stay, she developed respiratory paralysis and thus need ventilator support. Electrolytes and thyroid profile were normal. Workup for respiratory weakness with limb weakness with preserved deep tendon reflexes was done with neostigmine test. Positive response to the test was suggestive of myasthenia gravis; hence, pyridostigmine and steroids were started with which she was off ventilator in next 48 hours. Ultrasound abdomen and subsequently computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen done revealed a solid tumor of 8.5 × 4 × 5.5 cm of size in right paraspinal area near the hilum of right kidney []. Workup for pheochromocytoma prior to surgery was done which showed normal urinary metanephrins. Physical examination revealed slightly decreased breath sounds in both lungs with no crackles. Mild hyperinflation without infiltrates was visible on chest radiographs, but conventional CT of the chest showed no remarkable abnormalities. She underwent surgery for the retroperitoneal tumor and highly vascular tumor of 8 × 6 × 5 cm was removed without any intraoperative and post-operative complications. Histopathology revealed Castleman's disease of hyaline vascular variety [Figures -]. Skin lesions improved at the end of 2 weeks post-operatively [] and she was discharged with an advise to tapper her steroids and to continue pyridostigmine for myasthenia gravis."
"A 25-year-old female was admitted to our department because of pain and numbness in both arms, as well as neck pain. Upon cervical MRI, a Chiari malformation was discovered (). The patient underwent uncomplicated suboccipital craniectomy, C1 laminectomy, and duraplasty for decompression (). During the early postoperative period, the patient had trigeminal neuralgia at the second division of the right trigeminal nerve. Carbamazepine therapy was applied with a step-by-step dose increase up to 1 200 mg per day, and the pain resolved 4 months after surgery."
"A 25-year-old woman diagnosed as having nodular sclerosing HL from the left axillary lymph node biopsy almost 2 years ago presented to our clinic for evaluation of a 1 month history of a palpable left breast mass. At the time of initial diagnosis, she was staged at stage 2B. However, she was noncompliant with treatment with the chemotherapy regimen containing adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastin, and dacarbazine (ABVD), receiving a total of only 2 cycles and was then subsequently lost to follow-up. She never received any radiation therapy. She had received her last course approximately 6 months ago. In addition to the left breast mass, the patient denied any weight loss and night sweats in the 1 month duration. On examination, she had a hard 2 cm diameter fixed mass proximal to the left nipple. No lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was detected. Full blood count revealed a mild lymphocytosis for her age (total leukocyte count, 9.53 × 109/L; lymphocyte count, 5.01 × 109/L; neutrophil count, 7.04 × 109/L). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 35 mm/h and biochemical screening tests (including urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, lactate dehydrogenase, and immunoglobulins) were within normal limits. Ultrasound studies revealed an asymmetric hypoechoic density above the left nipple, with moderate distortion of the surrounding breast tissue, but no evidence of calcifications []. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was suspicious of malignancy. A core biopsy with the aid of ultrasound was then taken. The histopathology demonstrated nodular sclerosing HL with neoplastic Reed-Sternberg cells [] that were positive for CD30 [] and CD15 [], and negative for CD20, CD3, and CD79a. No abnormal cell populations were identified on flow cytometry study. She had a fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography FDG-PET/CT scan for restaging, which revealed FDG-avid hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy in the left cervical, left axillary, and left inguinal regions. Because the patient was never adequately treated with the first chemotherapy regimen (ABVD), because of her noncompliance issues, we have opted to resume the same regimen this time."
"The patient is a 25-year-old woman, gravida 0, who was referred to the gynecology oncology division at Chonnam National University Hospital with lower abdominal pain and abdominal mass. Her gynecologic history was unremarkable. Physical examination was notable for abdominal mass that was near at xiphoid process. Pelvic ultrasound revealed about more than 20 cm cystic mass. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis revealed about 23×21×9 cm sized serous borderline cystic tumor in the right ovary and 2.2 cm corpus luteum of the left ovary. There was no remarkable findings in the uterus and no abnormal pelvic lymphadenopathy. The tumor marker profile was as follows: CA-125 38.2 U/mL (0-35). Another tumor markers and the result of hematological analyses were within their normal ranges.\nExploration of the abdominopelvic cavity revealed about 23 cm sized brownish fluid contained cyst located within the right fallopian tube. Its surface was clear and on cut section, it had multiple papillary growing in inner surface (). The left ovary had about 1 cm sized whitish nodule. A right salpingectomy, left ovary wedge biopsy, appendectomy and cytology were performed. A frozen section of the right fallopian tube revealed a serous borderline tumor. And a frozen section of the left ovary revealed a fibroma. Exploration of the right ovary and left tube was unremarkable, and, in view of patient's age and desire for future fertility, no further surgical procedure was undertaken. Histologically, right tubal mass was serous borderline tumor and appendix uninvolved by tumor cells and cytology of peritoneal washing fluid was negative for malignant cells. Tumor had cystic change and papillary nodules. On microscopic examination the papillae were covered by serous type of epithelium (), displaying stratification and budding with focal nuclear atypia (). There was no invasion of the supportive stroma of the papillae or into the fallopian tube wall. Micropapillary pattern of the tumor was absent and there was no papillary tubal hyperplasia in the fallopian tube. In general, the histology of the tumor was similar to that of an ovarian borderline serous tumor. Pathologic diagnosis was serous borderline tumor of the right fallopian tube. Close follow-up was recommended and currently, the patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful."
"A 25-year-old male, known case of healed peripheral SC in the left eye, was noted to have a small yellowish macular lesion of SC [], hyperautofluorescent on FAF []. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/6, N/6.\nThe patient was started on tapering course of oral prednisolone, at 1 mg/kg body weight. At 2 weeks, the fundus lesion had enlarged []. BCVA was 3/60, N/36. On FAF, the lesion appeared hyperautofluorescent, with hypoautofluorescence along the superior border []. On careful evaluation, faint hyperautofluorescence extended over a wide area toward the disc []. At 3 weeks, clinical picture remained the same []. On FAF, the area of beginning of the lesion had become hypoautofluorescent and the wide area of faint hyperautofluorescence toward the disc was more prominent now [].\nAt 5 weeks, the fundus lesion had enlarged exactly along the area of faint hyperfluorescence as indicated on FAF in early stage []. On FAF, the border had become hyperfluorescent, whereas the rest of the lesion showed speckled hypo- and hyperfluorescence []. On weekly follow-ups, the border of the lesion appeared less active [Figures and ]. FAF showed a pattern of healing. First, there was sharpening of entire border as a distinct well-defined zone []. Next, the border showed a decrease in the width of hyperautofluorescence [].\nSubsequently, the lesion started healing [Figures , , ]. On FAF, the border gradually became less distinct with increasing hypoautofluorescent patches [Figures , , ]. On 2 weekly follow-ups, fundus examination showed the healed lesion [Figures , , ]. On FAF, the lesion including border was largely hypoautofluorescent, with the presence of few hyperautofluorescent specks [Figures and ]. The area of beginning of the lesion was still noticeable as the most hypoautofluorescent part []. At last visit, the patient was on the maintenance dose of Tab. prednisolone 10 mg/day, with BCVA of 6/60, N/36."
A 25 year old male with high voltage electric burn injury was admitted with the complaints of raw areas on the left upper arm with exposed shoulder joint []. The patient was a manual labourer by occupation and the sole earning member of his family. On examination there was a raw area over shoulder and arm along with exposed shoulder joint. It was decided to cover the exposed shoulder joint by a local flap and rest of the raw areas to be skin grafted.\nDoppler study was done prior to surgery to locate the position of perforator in the deltopectoral groove. The surgery was performed under general anaesthesia. Territory of the flap marked []. Dissection of the flap done over deltopectoral groove and the perforators present there are identified []. Then flap is raised along its entire margin. Flap is completely islanded around the perforator for better reach of the flap []. Suturing of the flap was done to the margin of a defect around the shoulder joint. Rest of the raw areas over lateral arm and the donor site of flap covered with split thickness skin graft [] and light compressive dressing along with limb splint age was done. In the Immediate post-operative period venous congestion of flap was encountered. A few flap insetting sutures were removed and immediately the colour of flap improved. 2 days later flap margins were resutured. It has been 12 months since surgery and the patient is satisfied with the results [].
"A 25-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Periodontology, Gian Sagar Dental College and Hospital, Ramnagar, Rajpura with a chief complaint of swelling in the lower right front region and receding gums in lower anterior tooth. On examination the swelling was found to be bony hard, extending from distal surface of right mandibular central incisor to the mesial surface of right mandibular canine. The recession was present in relation to 31 and was grade II according to Miller’s classification (Figures and ). On measurement with a periodontal probe the recession was 4 mm and the width of attached gingiva was approximately 3 mm in the adjacent teeth. The patient was examined for the etiology of recession, and it was found that the patient had a deep bite, so slight incisal grinding was done.\nHistory and blood investigations showed that the patient was fit for surgery. An informed consent was taken from the patient prior to the surgery. The patient was educated and motivated to observe strict plaque control measures and scaling and root planning was done. Patient was recalled for weekly plaque control assessment and was called for surgery after 4 weeks. The periodontal surgical procedure was done under local anesthesia. A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated by giving an internal bevel incision extending from mesial surface of 31 to distal surface of 43 (). Bleeding surface was created on the distal surface of 31 with BP blade no. 11. The area was debrided of granulation tissue and root planning was done (). Osteoplasty was done using a carbide round bur. After this root surface biomodification was done using cotton pledgets soaked in a saturated solution of citric acid (pH of 1.0) for 2-5 min and the root surface was profusely irrigated with water (). The flap was shifted laterally () and sutured using 3-0 mersilk sutures () and pack was placed (). The patient was prescribed with systemic antibiotics capsule Doxycycline 200 mg for the 1st day followed by 100 mg for next 4 days; anti-inflammatory analgesic tablet combiflam (ibuprofen 400 mg, paracetamol 325 mg) thrice daily for 5 days and were instructed to rinse with 0.2% Chlorhexidine digluconate twice daily for 1 week. The patient was then discharged with post-surgical instructions. The patient was recalled after 1 week and sutures were removed, and the area was irrigated.\nThe patient was instructed to maintain strict plaque control measures and was put on regular recall checkups. After 3 months, the recession was completely covered and the gingiva showed no signs of inflammation and also there was no recurrence of exostosis ()."
"Patient 2 was a 25-yr-old man with lifelong history of intractable seizures secondary to serious posterior left head trauma sustained at the age of 4 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presented posterior left hemispheric atrophy, a prominent area of tissue loss and gliotic lesion over the lateral temporoparietal region and ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy plus temporal horn enlargement (A). Surgical treatment involved extensive resection of the lateral temporo-parieto-occipital area, including the principal gliotic region and the lateral-inferior occipital region, sparing the medial temporal area (B), and achieved seizure freedom."
"A 25-year-old male ASA I, weighing 70 kg, presented for left parietotemporal craniotomy and resection of temporal lobe tumor. He underwent a successful tumor resection and was admitted in the neuro-intensive care unit (NICU) post-operatively. On post-operative day 2, the patient's level of consciousness deteriorated and he became unresponsive (Glasgow coma scale [GCS] 5/15). Computed tomography showed a large intracranial hematoma in the left temporal lobe with the midline shift. Patient was intubated in NICU and positive pressure ventilation was instituted at a higher rate and then transferred to the operating room for emergency decompression and hematoma evacuation.\nEndotracheal tube (ETT) was connected to the anesthetic machine (Aisys Care station (GE Health Care, Madison, WI. USA) ventilator and hyperventilated to keep end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) at 30-33 mmHg. Entropy electrodes were attached on the forehead opposite to the side of surgical incision and were connected to transducer and the module. His baseline entropy (response entropy (RE)/state entropy (SE) values were 37/33 without any sedation. Since his GCS and baseline entropy value were low, received only 100 mcg of fentanyl and 50 mg rocuronium. 2% xylocaine with adrenaline infiltration for head pin fixation followed by scalp flap infiltration with 0.5% bupivacaine + adrenaline (1 in 200,000) was done to reduce the pain thereby the anesthetic requirement. No other anesthetic agents were given for craniectomy because of the low entropy values. Entropy values remained low until the cranial decompression. Immediately following the removal of the bone flap, entropy value suddenly increased to (RE/SE) 94/83. Patient then received 50 mg bolus of propofol and sevoflurane was started. Entropy temporarily decreased to below (RE/SE) 40/40 but rebounded to 90/80 within 30 s. Sevoflurane concentration was then increased and additional doses of propofol were given. Entropy decreased to (RE/SE) 37/32 and remained low for the remainder of the procedure [].\nFollowing the procedure, patient was transferred to NICU. He was on mechanical ventilation for 8 days and transferred to rehabilitation center."
"A 25-year-old woman visited Department of Internal Medicine, Kyungpook National University Medical Center due to multiple colon polyps that had been detected incidentally. She had been healthy and had no remarkable medical history. According to her family history, her mother had colon cancer, and her brother had undergone a prophylactic colectomy for the treatment of FAP. The results of physical examination and laboratory data, including complete blood count and serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, were all within normal limits. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a normal mucosa finding. Colonoscopy examination revealed hundreds of polyps carpeting the entire colon and rectum, consistent with FAP (). Histologically, these polyps were all proven to be tubular adenomas. Because the standard therapy is a prophylactic total colectomy, we recommended that she undergo a prophylactic surgical treatment. However, the patient was fully aware of the unfavorable effect that a total colectomy had had on her brother. In addition, she was 25 and single. She had no large-sized polyps and no colon cancer. Her family agreed with our second proposal, which was not to perform surgical treatment until the subject was in her late twenties, if there was no apparent development of colonic cancer. Therefore, we delayed the prophylactic colectomy and decided on a treatment with oral sulindac, 100 mg twice a day.\nAfter the sulindac medication had been taken for 5 months, colonoscopy showed that the number and the size of polyps had been drastically decreased and that the polyps had almost completely disappeared (). Sulindac was found to have a sustained effect on the complete regression of colonic adenomas without the need for a polypectomy. Mild nausea was a side effect of the medication. However, after a few days, symptoms had disappeared without treatment. After the sulindac medication had been taken for 25 months, colonoscopy showed several sporadic, tiny polyps (). Thus, the effect of sulindac on the regression of the colonic adenomas had been maintained. We had been continuously treating her with oral sulindac, 100 mg twice a day. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were scheduled at regular intervals of one year."
"A 25-year-old, short stature (130 cm), apparently normal female was admitted to neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit with complaints of inability to move both lower limbs and bladder and bowel incontinence immediately following cesarean section under CNB 6 days back at the periphery hospital. The details of perioperative events were not documented. The patient was non-diabetic, normotensive. Patient had a history of surgery for swelling over lower back in infancy which was present since birth. Her antenatal period and pre-operative investigation were normal.\nOn examination, there was a transverse paramedian scar mark of about six inch over her lumbar area but there was no obvious spinal abnormality externally. Neurological examination revealed complete motor, sensory and autonomic loss of sensation below L2 level with involvement of bladder and bowel. An urgent X-ray lumbosacral spine and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord were done, which revealed congenital absence of L3-5 lumbar vertebrae with low lying spinal cord at L2 level, with myelitis and arachnoiditis []. L2 vertebrae were directly fused to the sacrum without any other deformity at that level. A probable diagnosis of chemical myelitis or direct injury to the cords was suspected. Patient was treated conservatively on rest and high doses of steroid (methyl prednisolone) to which she responded partially after 6 weeks in the form of motor recovery. There was no improvement in bladder and bowel function after 2 years."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian female with genital warts was treated with imiquimod 5% cream\nthree times weekly for 12 weeks .The treatment was well tolerated .At 4-month follow-up\nafter discontinuation, the patient was noted to have some residual condylomata and\nmarked depigmentation at the site of application.\nAt 8-month follow-up she was noted do have developed halos of hypomelanosis around four\npre-existing nevi of the trunk . At 18 months follow-up the genital depigmentation\npersisted and the halo nevi of the trunk were still present. Personal and family history\nfor melanoma, vitiligo and thyroid disorders were negative .Laboratory investigations,\nincluding a panel of auto-antibodies, were performed without any significant abnormal\nfinding."
"The present case report is about a 25-year-old female patient, already a known case of Arteriovenous malformation of oral cavity and she underwent embolization of the lesion, presented with incidental detection of bilateral multiple pulmonary nodules on CT scan. CT showed round or oval pulmonary nodules, with smooth margin associated with marked enhancement. She was referred for whole body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for detection of primary site and to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. PET/CT showed an intense uptake in the bilateral pulmonary nodules [] with largest nodule located in right lower lobe with a standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 10.5. Some of the lesions did not show FDG uptake patient underwent minithoracotomy and wedge biopsy of the lesion [] and biopsy confirmed PSH []. A diagnosis of bilateral multiple PSH was made and she was advised follow-up."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of facial pain and limited mouth opening associated with a 3-week history of swelling of the right cheek. Radiographic analysis revealed a loculated, fluid-filled, well-demarcated lesion destroying and expanding the ascending ramus, extending out into the soft tissues, from the condyle down to the angle (Fig. ).\nIncisional biopsy and histological examination revealed KCOT.\nA decision was made to decompress the lesion to try and shrink the cystic space, encouraging bony infill. Over the following 3 months the patient underwent a further three re-packing procedures with irrigation of the cavity. The site of the cyst and difficulty of access necessitated general anaesthesia. The patient was admitted on one occasion for intra-venous antibiotics following an acute infective episode affecting the area. During the third operative procedure a split nasopharyngeal tube was inserted into the cyst cavity and sutured in position (Fig. ). The patient was encouraged to flush the cavity clean through the tube drain.\nRadiographic examination over the following few months showed new bone formation and within 9 months of the initial biopsy the drain was expelled by formation of new bone (Fig. ). One year after the commencement of treatment the patient was admitted for enucleation of the cystic remnant. At the time of this procedure a small cyst was removed from the right upper ramus and condylar neck, together, with a separate cyst associated with the lower right wisdom tooth. The patient made an uneventful post-operative recovery and histology revealed two KCOTs with a thick parakeratinized type of epithelium typical of radicular cysts.\nPlain films along with CT scan, with 3 mm slices, were performed a further year later and showed good bone regeneration in the right ramus and condylar neck (Figs and ). No evidence of cystic recurrence was seen and no abnormalities within the adjacent soft tissues. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging also confirmed the absence of cystic remnants. The patient has now been reviewed for 5 years and there is no evidence of recurrence."
"A 25-year-old G4P0A3 female presented to the ED with lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding for three days. The patient was eight weeks gestation by dates and had not seen her obstetrician for pregnancy testing or confirmatory ultrasound. She denied any methods of assisted reproduction and had three previous spontaneous abortions. She had no other past medical history and took no medications or illicit drugs. Her abdominal pain was constant, non-radiating, and had no exacerbating or alleviating factors. She complained of associated nausea without vomiting, lightheadedness or dizziness. She denied trauma.\nThe patient’s vital signs on arrival were within normal limits. Her urine HCG was found to be positive. Physical examination revealed a young female without pallor in a mild amount of distress from pain. Pelvic examination demonstrated no tenderness or lesions, the cervical os was closed and there was no bleeding at the time of the examination. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit were 14 g/dL and 39.6% respectively. Serum HCG was found to be 36,940 mIU/ml. The blood type was O positive. She subsequently underwent point-of-care (POC) transabdominal sonography, which yielded inconclusive images. POC transvaginal sonography showed a gestational sac with yolk sac, consistent with an intrauterine pregnancy. A second gestational sac with yolk sac was also visualized posterior to the bladder (). The diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy was considered."
"Case 1 is a 25-year-old male with a venous malformation on the left cheek. His main concern was the visible deformity. The treatment was completed as a day case. The patient did not suffer from any serious complications. Following treatment the patient claimed his self-confidence, looks, smile and his ability to eat has improved. The patient found the treatment very successful and requires no further interventions Fig. ."
"A 25-year-old female presented with insidious onset weakness of both lower limbs after she had undergone an obstetric procedure under spinal anesthesia. Patient was asymptomatic prior to this procedure. The patient presented to our tertiary care center, 2 months after the procedure, with progressive flaccid paraparesis (grade 2/5) and bowel and bladder involvement. MRI of the lumbo-sacral spine revealed a large septated cystic lesion, with the intensity of CSF on both T1WI and T2WI [], extending from the D10 vertebral level to the L5 vertebral level. The rim as well as the septations showed intense contrast enhancement [Figure and ]. On the basis of a history of invasive procedure in the recent past, a working diagnosis of intradural spinal abscess was made. Unforunately, diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI was not performed at this time. The patient underwent L3-L4 hemi-laminectomy and drainage of the cystic lesion, but the cystic fluid revealed yellowish fluid. The cyst wall was sent for biopsy, which revealed schwannoma. The patient then underwent D11-L5 laminoplasty and total excision of the giant cystic schwannoma. She gradually recovered lower limb, bowel, and bladder function over a period of 3 months."
"A 25-year-old primigravida who was 2 months pregnant, with no history of any comorbid illness or trauma presented in emergency. Patient presented with decreased level of consciousness (E2V3M5) and right-sided hemiparesis of grade 3/5. There was no external mark of injury. Her history and systemic evaluation was negative for any cardiac anomaly. Hematological and biochemical parameters were within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a spontaneous acute SDH in left frontotemporoparietal (FTP) region with thickness of 8 mm and midline shift toward the right side []. There was no evidence of SAH. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain was done to rule out any benign or malignant pathology leading to blood in subdural space []. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of cerebral vasculature revealed a small aneurysm in the left side MCA peripheral branches (M5 segment), leading to acute SDH [Figure –]. Patient underwent left frontotemporal craniotomy with removal of acute SDH and clipping of aneurysm in the same sitting. She had uneventful recovery and was discharged in conscious state with subtle paresis on the right side. Patient is without any complication after 3 years of follow-up."
"A 25-year-old primigravida at 36 weeks of gestation presented in obstetric department with complaint of dyspnoea at rest, and clinical examination revealed her to be in cardiac failure. Two D Echo revealed cardiomyopathy, biventricular systolic dysfunction, Grade I diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 42%. Diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy was made. Tablet furosemide and tablet Methyldopa was started, and she was planned for elective cesarean section."
"A 25-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Conservative dentistry and Endodontics for endodontic evaluation of lower right first premolar. Intra oral periapical radiograph revealed aberrant canal pattern with respect to this tooth [].\nAfter local anesthesia administration and rubber dam isolation, access opening was performed and canals were located. Biomechanical preparation was done using crown down approach. The canal divided into three different canals at the mid level of root. So the canal was coronally flared till the midroot level for achieving ease of instrumentation. After sealer application in all the canals using lentulospiral, master cones were placed in all the three canals simultaneously and obturated with lateral condensation technique []."
"A 25-year-old unmarried female presented with distension of abdomen of 5 days duration. She did not have any menstrual complaints. Physical examination and radiologic findings revealed an abdominopelvic mass. At laparoscopy a yellow lobulated cystic mass was found attached to left ovary. The right ovary was unremarkable. The specimen of left ovarian mass measuring 9×8×4 cm was received in the histopathology section. It was well circumscribed, round to oval with a smooth outer surface. The cut section was pale yellow with solid cystic areas.\nThe microscopic appearance of all three cases was similar. Sections from the ovarian mass showed a pseudolobular pattern in which cellular areas were separated by oedematous collagenous hypocellular areas (). The cellular areas were composed of spindle shaped and round to oval cells with vesicular nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cellular areas revealed a thin-walled capillary network giving 'hemangiopericytoma-like' pattern (). In some cells the nuclei were eccentrically placed giving signet ring appearance. Nuclear atypia and mitosis were not seen."
"A 25-year-old woman was presented with pelvic pain during the last 4 months. Physical examination revealed a large, palpable abdomino-pelvic mass. There was no unusual symptoms such as hypermenorrhoea, menstrual irregularities and virilisation. Ultrasound examination showed a 15 cm heterogeneous left ovarian tumour consisting of predominantly solid tissue with several loculated cysts. Laboratory tests including tumour markers and serum hormonal assays were normal in case. The patient underwent laparotomical left oophorectomy and showed a normal uterus and right ovary with the left ovary replaced by a solid mass. Ascites was not present. On gross inspection, the removed left ovarian mass measured 15 × 14 × 13 cm. The mass was grey-white in color and had a smooth and well-encapsulated surface. The cut surface was a mostly solid and slightly oedematous []. The mass was described as benign by frozen analysis. The histologic features included a pseudolobular pattern with widespread areas of sclerosis and a two-cell population of spindled and round cells. Haemangiopericytoma-like vessels, myxoid to fibrotic stroma and focal cystic change were noted. Mitoses and necrosis were absent. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive inhibin []. The final diagnosis was that of sclerosing stromal tumour of the ovary. Post-operative recovery was uneventful."
"The patient was a 25-year-old female, with negative medical history, presenting with a history of trauma 5 years back in the right maxillary central incisor and having grade 2 mobility. radiographic examination revealed periapical radiolucency with resorbed root and two canals in maxillary central incisor []. as the tooth was esthetically very important for that female patient, it was decided to retain the tooth by placing endodontic implant.\nThe access preparation was carried out, and a working length radiograph was taken []. Cleaning and shaping was carried out and the patient was scheduled for surgery, which was performed after four days and antibiotics and analgesics were prescribed. On the day of surgery bilateral infraorbital and nasopalatine block was given with 2% lignocaine hydrochloride with 1:50,000 adrenaline. A two sided vertical flap was raised from distal margin of 12 and 21. Incision was given on interdental bone and leaving the marginal papilla intact. Bone resorption was clearly evident at cervical region of central incisor and a bony defect apically. The bony defect was curetted thoroughly and simultaneously irrigated with saline. One canal was obturated with gutta percha and MTA based sealer (Fillapex) and no. 30 H-file was used for preparing a 5 mm channel in periapical area through second canal. No. 35 H-file was then threaded into the prepared channel. The complete canal was obturated with light cured glass ionomer cement. File was grooved at 16 mm from tip so that the handle can be separated once the file was in a position []. 3-0 black silk sutures were placed in vertical flap, and marginal gingival and antibiotics and analgesics were prescribed. After 4 days, sutures were removed. Follow-up was done every month. Six months later an oral and radiographic examination revealed reduced mobility and bone formation in radiolucent area []."
"A 25-year-old man presented with multiple bilateral neck swelling along with a nasal vocal intonation, weight loss, and low-grade fever since 1 month. He was externally evaluated via neck ultrasonography and nasal endoscopy, which revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and nasopharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia, respectively. The results of fine needle aspiration of a cervical lymph node were suggestive of a hemato-lymphoid malignancy, and the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. Upon examination, he presented with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. His lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated (1,703 U/L; reference range, 313-618 U/L) and liver and renal functions were normal. Hematological parameters revealed a hemoglobin level of 55 g/L, total leukocyte count of 193.8×109 cells/L, and platelet count of 40×109 cells/L. A peripheral blood smear revealed a blast frequency of 88%; these were large with scant light blue agranular cytoplasm, open nuclear chromatin, and 1-2 indistinct nucleoli. The bone marrow showed near total replacement by blasts. Most blasts exhibited the previously described morphology, but few had moderate amounts of granular cytoplasm, fine nuclear chromatin, and 2-3 prominent nucleoli, and occasional blasts contained Auer rods (). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) cytochemistry revealed approximately 3% MPO-positive blasts, including an occasional Auer rod (). Flow cytometric immunophenotyping revealed that the blasts were positive for CD45; the T cell markers cCD3, CD2, and CD7; and the myeloid/stem cell markers CD34, CD117, CD13, HLA-DR, CD123, and CD99, but were negative for CD1a, CD8, and CD5 as well as CD19, CD10, CD4, sCD3, CD64, CD14, CD20, CD33, CD56, CD16, CD66b, CD15, CD11b, and MPO, suggesting a diagnosis of ETP-ALL (). Given the morphological presence of MPO-positive Auer rods and the flow cytometric ETP-ALL phenotype, a final diagnosis of MPAL (T/Myeloid) was made. Conventional karyotyping revealed 47, XY, +4, and t(6;14)(q27:q22). The real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was positive for FLT3-ITD mutation and negative for NPM1 mutation."
"A previously healthy 25-year-old Haitian female, suffering only from headaches and back pain since delivery after an uneventful pregnancy 1 month previously, was admitted for sudden visual loss and impaired consciousness. She had no motor or sensory disturbance, but had complete visual loss with fixed, dilated pupils. Her body temperature was 38℃. CT scan and MRI of the head disclosed enlargement of the entire ventricular system and a calcification in the right occipital lobe (). Insertion of external ventricular drainage resulted in dramatic improvement of consciousness and visual recovery. Her ventricular CSF biology was normal (protein, 0.4 g/L; leukocyte count, 12/mm3). Her body temperature rapidly rose to 40℃ and a lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF level of protein was 8.5 g/L, and the leukocyte count was 680/mm3, among which 61% were lymphocytes and 18% were eosinophils. These discrepancies between ventricular and lumbar CSF samples led to MRI of the spine, which disclosed a heterogeneous mass located in the cauda equina from L4 to S2. There was neither leptomeningeal enhancement nor subarachnoid cysts suggestive of arachnoiditis at the thoracic, cervical, or cranial levels (). Since there was no other obvious explanation for the hydrocephalus (no obstructive lesion of the intracerebral CSF pathways nor at the craniocervical junction, and no abnormality in the spinal subarachnoid spaces at superior levels), this lumbosacral mass was considered to be responsible for the hydrocephalus, due to obstruction of the subarachnoid spaces by the mass itself and/or surrounding arachnoiditis. Surgery performed via a lumbosacral laminectomy allowed subtotal removal of an intradural, poorly limited, pearly white mass with small cystic formations surrounding the nerve roots, with thickening of the arachnoid layer. Histological examination revealed parasitic cysts. No scolex was found, but immunological blood and CSF tests for cysticercosis were positive. Although surgery led to disappearance of the symptoms, the patient was provided with adjunctive albendazole. There was no recurrence during a 15-year follow-up, with the patient leading a normal life."
"Mr. V, a 25-year-old male, who studied up to 12th standard, laborer by occupation has been brought by his mother with complaints of suspicion that his mother is making sexual advance towards him and also strongly believes that she manipulated his genitals. The complaint was advanced with great intensity and the patient was totally convinced of his belief despite all evidence to the contrary. Relatively his social and occupational functioning was adequate. When his belief was counteracted he would become irritable and would abuse and assault his mother. Also he had added suspicion that, his friend Mr. Z would kill him which developed secondary to the incident of an altercation with Mr. Z. But this belief does not predominate his delusional system. He was taken to various temples for magico-religious treatments. His appetite, sleep, and self-care were normal according to his parents. Because of frequent expression of his belief that his mother manipulated his genitals, his parents were ashamed and started to hate him. Mr. V also infrequently regrets about his thoughts whether a mother could manipulate her son's genitals. Further questioning revealed that the patient while he was 14-years-old exposed his genitals in front of a girl belonging to his class. Later he repeatedly regretted for this act to his mother and also to that girls brother. He also frequently reads obscene sexually stimulating books and then he generalizes the acts done by the females in those obscene stories over every other female. Also when he was 20-years-old, he attended a prostitute once. He was using chewable tobacco for past 12 years and now has intense craving, tolerance (10 packs/day), inability to control its use, and using the substance even after knowing its harmful effects, satisfying the criteria for nicotine dependence. Previously he smoked Cannabis twice and uses alcohol occasionally. Born out of nonconsanguineous marriage, developmental milestones were normal. Premorbid personality was adjustable, sociable, and meticulous at work.\nHis physical examination revealed normal findings. MSE reveals presence of delusion that his mother manipulated his penis and nil psychopathology noted in other domains. After the interview the patient repeatedly entered the interviewing room and he idealized the interviewer and also repeatedly questioned the interviewer several times about the validity of his beliefs and tried to stimulate the interviewer's counter transference reactions."
"A 25-year-old primiparous lady presented to the antenatal clinic for a routine checkup at 36 weeks gestation. During her visit, she demonstrated a large pedunculated tumor on the dorsal surface of the interphalangeal joint of her right thumb ().\nThis initially started as a small pimple which she first noticed at approximately 24 weeks gestation. She decided to burst and drain the pimple then, and again 4 weeks later, which resulted in a small bleed from the lesion on both occasions. However, the pimple continued to grow in size, and at 32 weeks gestation she presented to her General Practitioner who commenced her on oral co-amoxiclav. This had no effect on the lesion, and it continued to grow, reaching a size of 2.5×2.5×1 cm on presentation to her antenatal visit at 36 weeks gestation. It had at that stage become oozy, foul-smelling and was causing her significant local pain. At that point, we referred her to the plastic surgery team at our affiliated general hospital. The lesion was excised under local anesthetic. The lesion was a polypoid lobulated mass measuring 24×23×10 mm, with slicing showing a fatty tan surface admixed with blood. Histopathological examination of the lesion showed evidence of a hemangioma with overlying infarction, ulceration and inflammation with no atypical features ().\nShe was admitted to the Rotunda Hospital a week after with pregnancy-induced hypertension, which was controlled with labetalol 200 mg twice daily. She delivered in spontaneous labor two days post admission."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with history of vomiting and oliguria for 10 days. Patient had taken a handful of orange red crystals with suicidal intent 10 days earlier while working in a printing press []. She developed severe abdominal pain and vomiting immediately. She was taken to a local hospital where stomach wash was given and managed conservatively. Patient was discharged after 3 days. Patient continued to have abdominal pain, vomiting, and progressive oliguria.\nOn examination, patient was dehydrated with blood pressure of 130/80 mm of Hg and pulse of 98/min. Her investigations showed hemoglobin 7.2 g/dl, urea 650 mg/dl, creatinine 19 mg/dl, sodium 122 mEq/L, potassium 7.9 mEq/L, calcium 6.7 mg/dl, phosphorus 5.6 mg/dl, bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl, albumin 4.1 g/dl, total protein 7.2 g/dl, alanine transaminase 28 IU/l, aspartate transaminase 106 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 66 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 124 IU/L, and creatine kinase 67 IU/L. Her urine analysis showed trace proteinuria, and few dark granular casts. Her arterial blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.01, pCO2of 23 mm of Hg and bicarbonate of 6 mEq/L. Her electrocardiogram showed tall peaked T waves with prolongation of PR interval and QRS duration. Coagulation parameters were normal.\nPatient was taken up for hemodialysis through right internal jugular catheter. She received 5 sessions of hemodialysis and other supportive measures. Chemical analysis of stomach contents was positive for ammonium ions. Patient later identified the empty bottle containing ammonium dichromate. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy done 3 weeks after ingestion was normal. Patient urine output improved gradually and she was discharged with creatinine of 1.3 mg/dl. Her serum creatinine during the last follow-up was 1.1 mg/dl."
"A 25-year-old Korean woman was referred by a general physician with a 7-month history of uncontrolled hypertension. Her past me-dical and family histories were otherwise non-contributory. On admission, she was 165 cm tall and weighed 53 kg. Physical examination was unremarkable except for high blood pressure of 182/115 mm Hg. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria and minimal pro-teinuria. Laboratory examination results were within normal limits, except for an increase in plasma renin activity (>20 ng/mL/hr, normal range: supine, 0.5-1.9 ng/mL/hr; erect, 1.9-6.0 ng/mL/hr), plasma aldosterone (668.21 pg/mL, normal range: supine, 10-105 pg/mL; erect, 34-273 pg/mL) and angiotensin II (90 pg/mL, normal range: 9-47 pg/mL). Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which was confirmed as mild LVH on echocardiography. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated compression of the LRV between the aorta and SMA with pelvic congestion syndrome (). An adrenal tumor was not detected, and both renal arteries were intact. Renal scintigraphic findings using technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, with and without captopril challenge, were normal. Selective renal venography demonstrated stenosis of the LRV at the level of the aorta, with dilatation of the left ovarian vein and multiple collateral veins with contrast filling the pelvic cavity (). The pressure gradient between the LRV and the inferior vena cava was 8 mm Hg (normal <3 mm Hg). Plasma renin activity in the LRV was almost five times higher than that in the right renal vein (5.88 ng/mL/hr vs. 1.17 ng/mL/hr). Hypertension did not respond to calcium channel antagonist and beta adrenergic blocker, but, the blood pressure decreased to 110/65 mm Hg after administration of angiotensin receptor blocker, candesartan (16 mg/d). The patient has not suffered from hypertension for more than 2 years with the use of this medication."
"A 25-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male was evacuated from 3,200 meters after experiencing nausea, headache, shortness of breath, and cough. The patient, who frequently enjoyed short mountaineering trips from his home at sea level, had been at altitude the previous weekend with no concerns. On the first day of ascent his group had slept at 1,800 meters and ascended to 3,200 meters on day two. Subsequently the patient felt malaised and experienced a cough. Later on day two he developed nausea and insomnia. By the morning of day three his cough worsened and progressed to frank shortness of breath, but he refused to descend. As the day progressed so did his symptoms, he was no longer able to self-descend and was airlifted to base and transported to a community academic emergency department (ED) approximately one hour away.\nDuring transport he reported complete resolution of his headache and nausea immediately after landing at base altitude but continued to complain of progressively worsening dyspnea despite high-flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask. His vital signs on arrival in the ED were: temperature: 98.6°F, heart rate: 86, blood pressure 131/76, respiratory rate: 20, and oxygen saturation 80% on room air, which represented an improvement from prehospital saturations between 60–70%. On exam he had diffusely coarse breath sounds, audible without a stethoscope, with use of accessory muscles, but was otherwise well appearing. He was given 100% oxygen, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, inhaled and intravenous dexamethasone, 5mg of intravenous hydralazine, and 40mEq of intravenous furosemide. Subsequently his oxygen saturations improved to the mid 90s on two liters of oxygen via nasal cannula, and his breath sounds and respiratory effort improved substantially. He was placed in observation, was continued on intravenous dexamethasone, and was successfully discharged the next day. After discharge the patient’s father remembered that he had been forced to abort a hiking trip at altitude as a young man due to sudden onset of “asthma,” a condition of which he had no prior diagnosis."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a localized area of non-itchy thickened and hyperpigmented skin on left side of the chest for 8 years. He was the second among four children born out of a non-consanguineous marriage, and there was no other family member with similar skin lesions. To start with, there was a small dark-colored asymptomatic papule over the left side of chest. It progressed over five years to attain the present status and remained inactive thereafter. There was no history of rubbing the area or any topical application. He did not give any history of consuming nicotinic acid derivatives, triazinate, and so on. Dermatological examination revealed multiple broad brown-black velvety plaques with soft ridges and ill-defined margins, measuring approximately 3 × 3 cm to 5 × 5 cm over the lateral aspect of the left side of chest []. The borders were irregular with a tendency of the affected skin to eventually merge inconspicuously with the surrounding normal skin, with a few hairs over the lesions. Otherwise, the skin was normal. The nape of neck, axillae, waist line, and buttocks were free from any skin lesions. Palms and soles, mucosae, genitals, hair, and nails were normal. The clinical differentials considered were linear epidermal nevus, linear acanthosis nigricans, and seborrhoeic keratosis.\nThe patient was non-obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 21.2. Systemic examination was non-contributory. Complete blood count and routine urine analysis were normal. Serology for venereal disease research laboratory and human immunodeficiency virus was non-reactive. Fasting and postprandial blood sugar were 91 and 103 mg/dL, respectively. Fasting insulin level was 10.7 IU/mL. Hepatic profile, T3, T4, thyroid stimulating hormone, and growth hormone were normal as well. Radiological examination of the chest, skull, and hands were normal. In addition to this, abdominal ultrasonography was also found to be within normal limits. Biopsy of the skin showed hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, hyperpigmentation of the basal layer, and mild acanthosis. The dermal papillae showed upward finger-like projections and the valleys between the papillae were filled with keratotic material [Figures and ]. Based on clinical and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of “unilateral nevoid acanthosis nigricans” was made. He has been prescribed topical retinoids, counselled regarding the benign nature of the disease and is under regular follow-up."
We present the normal case of a 25-year-old man. The length of its cervical cord was the longest in flexion and the elongation change was the largest in the posterior cervical spinal canal ().
"A 25 year old housewife was being investigated for primary infertility and a large solid heterogenous hypoechoic mass with smooth walls posterior to uterus was found on ultrasonography (USG). The treating gynecologist referred her to a tertiary care center for further investigations. She presented to our hospital on 13th November 2013. She was a known case of hypothyroidism on treatment and had irregular menstruation for the last 8 months.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was advised for further evaluation, which revealed a 9.4 cm × 6.5 cm × 5.7 cm, well-defined thin-walled lesion in the pre-sacral and pre-coccygeal region in the pelvis in midline extending towards the right with displacement of rectum and uterus to the left. It appeared benign on MRI and differential diagnosis of Schwannoma and ganglioneuroma were given [Figures and ].\nAfter adequate pre-operative work-up and consultation with a Spine-Neurosurgeon, the patient underwent robotic excision of the tumor on 21st November 2013. The patient was placed in modified Lloyd Davis position. A 12mm supra-umbilical incision was taken and 12mm trocar was introduced. Carbon dioxide pneumo-peritoneum was created. Two da Vinci 8mm ports were introduced, one in the left and other in the right lower quadrants each about 8 cm away from the optic port on either side. Once the trocars were placed, a steep Trendelenberg position with a slight left side downward tilt was given and the robot was docked. The retroperitoneum was accessed by incising the peritoneal fold on the right side of the rectum. The presacral area was dissected and the right parametrium and broad ligament were dissected to identify the tumor mass. An intraoperative laparoscopic USG was done and tumor was localized entering into the fold of the broad ligament on the right side in between the uterosacral ligament, uterus and rectum; and pushing the uterus anteriorly and the rectum laterally as seen on the MRI [Figures and ].\nDissection was done circumferentially around the tumor mass with help of Myoma screw for traction. The base of the tumor was firmly adherent and originated from the nerve root. The specimen was dissected free and removed en masse with help of Endocatch bag after extending the assistant port incision. The console time was 195 min and total blood loss was 40 ml. Pelvic drain was placed. Patient was discharged on post-operative Day 3 after drain removal. Histopathology report confirmed the lesion as a benign ganglioneuroma []."
"A 25-year-old otherwise healthy male presented with a history of poor vision in both eyes for many years for which he had been wearing thick hyperopic glasses. Neither his non-consanguineous parents nor his five siblings had poor vision or obvious hyperopia. One year prior to his presentation at our institution, he underwent clear lens extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in both eyes as a refractive procedure. His vision did not improve following surgery, and he was diagnosed with postoperative CME, namely, Irvine-Gass syndrome, as the cause of his poor visual outcome. During his postoperative course, the CME appearance persisted for which he received five intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and two transseptal triamcinolone injections for each eye. He was also treated with oral diamox with no improvement and was referred to us for non-responding CME.\nOn examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/125 in the right eye and 20/160 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure measured 12 mmHg and 16 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. The anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes except for well-centered posterior chamber intraocular lens bilaterally and mild posterior capsule opacification. The white-to-white horizontal corneal measurement was 11.5 mm in each eye. The posterior segment examination of both eyes showed mildly dilated and tortuous retinal blood vessels with a crowded optic disc and a horizontal PMF. PM was suspected, so an A-scan ultrasonography was performed, and it disclosed short globes with an axial length of 15.83 mm in the right eye and 15.87 mm in the left eye. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) of the macula in both eyes showed a PMF (categorized as a high, inverted U pattern) with cyst-like cavities in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers (). Fundus fluorescein angiography showed no optic nerve head staining or macular leakage (). These findings confirmed the diagnosis of PM and bilateral PMF with intrinsic cysts that were incorrectly thought to represent postoperative CME (Irvine-Gass syndrome) and triggered unnecessary treatment. No further treatment for the PMF was recommended. A year later, the clinical and SD-OCT appearances of the PMF were unchanged ()."
"A 25-year-old male patient complained of longer teeth in relation to upper left anterior region. On examination there was Miller's Class I gingival recession in relation to 21, 22 and 23."
"A 25-year-old female, gravida 3, was admitted to the outpatient gynecology clinic complaining of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding after 6 weeks of amenorrhea. Her previous menstrual cycles had been regular at 30 days, with average flow and no dysmenorrhea.\nShe had tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, with normal vital signs. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed an empty uterine cavity and a gestational sac in the right adnexa, with no fetal cardiac activity, and there was no intra-abdominal free fluid. Laboratory tests showed an hCG level of 585 mIU/mL.\nA single dose of MTX (50 mg/m2) was administered intramuscularly on day 1, and the hCG was 19.1 (minute 5) and 9.8 mIU/mL, respectively, on days 4 and 7. The patient’s liver function tests were normal and an additional dose of MTX was given. Subsequently, the hCG levels decreased. After the treatment, however, she developed pain and swelling of both knees.\nOn examination, she was afebrile and appeared well. Both knees were swollen and tender. A blood count revealed a hemoglobin of 12 g/dL (normal range 12–16 g/dL), total white blood cells at 13,600/L (normal range 3,600–10,000/L), and platelets at 576,000/L (normal range 130,000–400,000/L). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 100 mm/h (normal range 0–20 mm/h), and the C-reactive protein (CRP) 43 mg/L (normal range 0–7 mg/L). A direct radiographic evaluation was normal (). She had no comorbidities. Joint ultrasonography showed anterior soft tissue swelling with a thickened synovium and fluid collections measuring 1.0×0.9×2 cm in the right knee and 1.1×0.9×1.8 cm in the left. She was diagnosed with bilateral septic arthritis and underwent arthroscopic debridement and washout.\nIn the operating room, the puncture wound was extended about 1 cm in both directions. Pus was expressed with manual manipulation. A moderate amount of pus remained in both joints. Arthroscopic debridement and irrigation were done to break up any adhesions in the joint and to ensure that there were no pockets of pus or anything walled off, such as an abscess or phlegmon; culture antibiogram evaluation done and both joints were irrigated with approximately 3 L of saline. A Hemovac drain was placed in each joint. The wound cultures grew Gram-positive cocci (S. aureus) resistant to ampicillin, so vancomycin was started. The patient improved rapidly after the surgery. Active and passive movement increased to a total of 90°."
"This is a case report of a 25-year-old male patient who presented to the Department of Urology with a painless right testicular mass. Ultrasonography revealed a solid mass suspicious for malignancy and hence he underwent a radical orchidectomy. Histology revealed a small focus (9 mm) of classical seminoma, pT1. Pre-operative tumor markers were normal and staging computed tomography (CT) did not show any evidence of metastatic disease. He went on to receive a single dose of adjuvant carboplatin chemotherapy.\n2 years later, he developed persistent hematospermia associated with increasingly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and α-fetoprotein (1542 and 2033 respectively). Restaging CT, ultrasound of the remaining testicle and brain magnetic resonance imaging were normal. However, subsequent fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) revealed abnormal activity within the seminal vesicles [] and so he went on to have a transrectal ultrasound scan which confirmed abnormal appearances of the seminal vesicles. Biopsies were taken which revealed a YST. He underwent 4 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy, followed by a radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. Histology confirmed YST of both seminal vesicles extending into the prostate with clear margins and negative pelvic lymph nodes []. Tumor markers returned to normal post-operatively and he is currently under surveillance."
"A 25-year-old man with a non-contributory medical history reported to our department with complaint of a fractured upper anterior tooth. History revealed trauma and fracture of the tooth 7 days back. On examination, an Ellis class III fracture with clinical pulp involvement was seen in relation to 11. The exposed pulp appeared light pink in color. Patient experienced momentary pain on having cold drinks which was relieved once the stimulus was removed. Radiographic examination showed no evidence of root fracture or apical pathoses. The tooth responded normally to the electric pulp testing that was performed on the labial surface. These signs and symptoms signified healthy status of the pulp. Hence, a partial pulpotomy procedure was carried out for 11 []."
"A 25-year-old Asian Indian female, from agricultural background in rural south India visited our hospital with blunt injury to right eye (RE) followed by diminution of vision, pain, redness and watering. She was already on topical and oral steroids, cycloplegics and anti-glaucoma medications (including acetazolamide). Her past and medical history was unremarkable. On examination, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/120, N36 in RE and 20/20, N6 in left eye (LE). Goldmann applanation tonometry was 34 and 12 mm of Hg in RE and LE respectively. Anterior segment examination of RE revealed circum-corneal congestion, microcystic corneal edema, anterior chamber (AC) reaction, dilated pupil, inferior subluxation of cataractous lens and a whitish mobile body in AC 4 mm in length showing undulating movements []. The optic disc was healthy and retina attached. LE was normal. Her systemic examination was unremarkable.\nA diagnosis of RE traumatic subluxation of lens with live worm in AC was made. The patient was taken up for surgical removal of the parasite with dislocated lens via pars plana route (20G) and lensectomy, vitrectomy, belt buckling with peripheral laser was done under local anaesthesia. The parasite was seen in the anterior chamber just prior to the start of surgery but had moved posteriorly by the time anesthesia was administered and the eye was prepared. 20G pars plana sclerotomies were made and lensectomy was started, during which time it was seen stuck to the posterior lens surface []. The parasite then suddenly disappeared from view and could not be traced despite complete clearing of media and thorough retinal examination with scleral depression. No evidence of retinal or subretinal hemorrhages was seen to suggest subretinal passage that is known to occur with live parasites during attempted removal. The pars plana showed a small fibrotic scar which could have indicated a previous location of the parasite. On a suspicion of it being sucked into the cutter port unnoticed, the vitrectomy cassette fluid was sent to pathology lab and sedimented, the wet mount of which revealed a worm [] which was identified as nymphal stage of L. serrata by one of the authors (MR) who is a veterinary parasitologist.\nThe postoperative period was uneventful. Patient was reviewed after 6 weeks with BCVA of 20/40, N6 in RE and a quiet eye [], normal intraocular pressure, clear vitreous cavity and an attached retina. Scleral fixated intraocular lens implantation was done 6 months after the initial surgery following which her BCVA was 20/30, N6 with quiet eye and normal posterior segment."
"A 25-year-old male, born out of a nonconsanguineous marriage presented to the outpatient department of our hospital with complaints of pigmentation of skin, painful fissures of the hands and feet, with hypohidrosis since birth. There was tightening of skin of the distal extremities since 15 years. His family members were unaffected. There was no history of Raynaud's phenomenon, photosensitivity, growth or mental retardation, exposure to chemicals or any drugs that would be responsible for his sclerotic skin. On examination, both palms and soles had diffuse scleroatrophy with fissuring and hyperpigmentation []. The skin had reduced pinchability on the distal extremities with generalized atrophy, dyschromia, telangiectasia, and xerosis []. There was ulnar deviation at the left wrist due to contracture along the ulnar border of the palm. A raised tender nodular lesion measuring around 1 cm × 1.5 cm was present on the left thenar eminence; there was no ulceration or bleeding from the lesion [].\nNail changes were characteristic with minimal growth of the third and fifth toenail bilaterally and absence of nail of the second right toe []. All the finger and toenails had longitudinal ridging and discoloration. Routine blood investigations were within normal limits. Biopsy was performed from three different sites viz., the left thenar nodule, right palm and dorsal aspect of proximal third of the left forearm.\nExcisional biopsy of the thenar nodule revealed mild hyperkeratosis with dysplasia of the basal keratinocytes and formation of small buds extending into the papillary dermis, features suggestive of actinic keratosis, which is a precursor of SCC. Biopsy of palms and soles revealed massive hyperkeratosis and acanthosis and that of the sclerosed skin on the left forearm showed acanthosis with an accentuated granular layer, orthohyperkeratosis with sparse mononuclear cell infiltrate []. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a marked reduction in CD1a, Lag+ and S-100 epidermal Langerhans cells [Figures and ], which is a characteristic finding of Huriez syndrome.[] Based on the history, clinical findings and histopathological features, we made a diagnosis of nonfamilial Huriez syndrome.\nThe margins of the excised nodule were free of any precursor neoplastic changes; thus, it was deemed adequate. The patient was given topical tazarotene and emollients and advised a six monthly follow-up. He has been on regular follow-up for more than three years now, and there is no other nodular eruption or growth suggestive of SCC till date."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with painless mass in the left forearm for past 1 year and the mass was well-defined, nontender, and subcutaneous in location. On examination, the swelling was on the left side of his forearm and measuring approximately 3 × 2 cm []. His blood smear examination was negative for microfilaria. All other systemic examination and laboratory investigations were within normal limits. It was clinically diagnosed as sebaceous cyst and advised complete excision of the mass for definitive diagnosis. The excised mass was 2 × 2 cm and grey-white. The cut surface was grey-white with necrotic areas.\nHematoxylin and eosin stained sections showed cross-sections of nematode, which is surrounded by an inflammatory granulation tissue composed of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and occasional foreign body giant cells []. An outer surface of the nematode shows cuticle showing fine transverse striations and prominent longitudinal ridges []; with these features the worm was identified as an adult, female D. repens."
"A 25-year-old female patient reported to our department with the chief complaint of grossly destroyed lower right back tooth. Clinical examination revealed root canal treated 46 without coronal restoration. The tooth was free of sign and symptoms, intra oral periapical radiograph revealed adequately filled root canal. Treatment plan was explained to the patient that the restoration of the tooth can be done using split cast post and core. The lock post was placed in the distal canal, and the key post was placed in mesio-lingual canal. All the clinical steps for the fabrication of lock and key post and core were followed as mentioned in case 1 []. The restored tooth was evaluvated after 6 months by clinically and radiographically. The tooth is functioning normal without any signs and symptoms."
"A 25-year-old female patient visited the neurology outpatient clinic with severe holocranial headache that had persisted for 2 months. The pain was intermittent and relieved by analgesics. Clinical examination was unremarkable.\nComputed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed absent bony carotid canal on the left side [Figure and ]. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) [Figure and ] showed complete absence of the cervical and petrous part of the left ICA. An abnormal vessel was seen arising from the cavernous segment of the right ICA. This vessel was passing across the floor of sella, reconstituting the cavernous and supraclinoid segments of the left ICA, and continuing as the left MCA. Aplasia of A1 segment of left ACA was also observed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed absent left ICA flow void with an abnormal flow void in the sella [Figure and ]. No evidence of any SAH or aneurysm was seen. The vertebrobasilar system was normal.\nDoppler imaging [Figure –] showed complete absence of the left ICA. The left common carotid artery (CCA) was seen continuous with the external carotid artery (ECA). The left CCA and ECA showed high resistance flow with narrow systolic peak and low diastole. Since the right CCA has to compensate for the absent left ICA, it showed low resistance flow with broad systolic peak and high diastolic flow.\nLateral radiograph of the skull [] and the corresponding sagittal reformatted CT scan [] showed a well-defined lytic area in the anteroinferior aspect of the sella due to the abnormal intercavernous vessel traversing across it."
"A 25-year-old male presented with the complaints of fever with chills and rigor accompanied with severe headache, vomiting, convulsions, and altered sensorium for 6 days. He had no history of recreational drug use, diabetes, and hypertension. He also did not reveal any history suggestive of renal parenchymal disease or vasculitis.\nOn examination, he was comatose, febrile (102°F), pulse – 130/min, and BP – 140/70 mm Hg. Neurological examination revealed a comatose patient with bilateral constricted sluggish-reacting pupils without other cranial nerve deficits. Plantar response was bilaterally extensor. There was decerebrate posturing and neck rigidity was mild. Cardiovascular examination revealed no abnormality of peripheral pulses, bruits or cardiomegaly. Respiratory and abdominal examination revealed no abnormality.\nBlood counts revealed a normocytic, normochromic anemia (hemoglobin – 9.7 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume – 90 fl), ESR – 28 mm/h, and platelet count of 75,000/cu.mm. Thick and thin blood smears were prepared and it revealed ring forms and gametocytes of P. falciparum and immunochromatographic test for PfHRP-2 based assay (ICT, Access Bio. Inc., NJ, USA) was strongly positive. Biochemical investigations – LFTs, renal function tests, and serum electrolytes were within the normal limits. No abnormality was found on urine examination with respect to proteinuria, red blood cells, white blood cells or casts. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human immunodeficiency virus was negative.\nA clinical diagnosis of cerebral malaria caused by P. falciparum was established, and the patient was started on intravenous artesunate therapy. Following a lack of improvement in sensorium despite 3 days of antimalarial treatment, a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan brain was advised, which surprisingly revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) []. A coagulation screen was found to be within normal range. Prothrombin time-international normalized ratio was 1.3 and activated partial thromboplastin time was 32 s. Fibrin degradation products by D-dimer were negative. A magnetic resonance angiography was carried out, which revealed no arterio-venous malformation or aneurysm. Anti-nuclear antibody titers were found to be negative by standard method. There was no family history of sickle cell anemia, and a sickling test on peripheral blood smear using sodium metabisulfite was negative.\nThe patient had a stormy clinical course and ultimately died 3 days later in spite of aggressive treatment with intravenous artesunate and supporting ventilator measures."
"A 25-year-old lady was admitted in the pulmonology ward with the diagnosis of pneumonia. The patient had presented with a history of progressive shortness of breath, chest pain and persistent cough with occasional haemoptysis. She had a history of being treated with antibiotics and anti-TB drugs in outpatient basis. She had had spontaneous abortion 8 months back. Since her symptoms were persistent and her general condition was deteriorating, she was admitted to the ward. On examination, she had crepitations in bilateral chest and an oxygen saturation of only 80%. Chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrations. CECT chest was done, which revealed pulmonary embolus occluding the main pulmonary artery, and right and left pulmonary arteries (Fig. ). Venous Doppler did not reveal thrombosis of the lower limbs or IVC. Pulmonary thromboembolectomy was done and embolus (Fig. ) was sent for histopathological examination. The examination revealed it to be metastatic choriocarcinoma (Fig. ). Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) level was found to be significantly high. CECT pelvis and head were negative for pelvic and CNS metastases. She was managed further with chemotherapy (EMACO regimen) with excellent response to the treatment."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a history of recurrent UTI. He had undergoing augmentation ileocystoplasty with cutaneous diversion by Mitrofanoff principle for pelvic fracture distraction urethral defect and rectourethral fistula following road traffic accident ten years ago. His physical examination, including per rectal examination, revealed normal findings. The routine investigations were done and revealed normal hemoglobin level, total leukocyte count of 11 × 109/L, and normal findings on renal function tests (serum creatinine, 97.24 μmol/L; and urea 8.93 mmol/L). Further imaging studies such as ultrasonography, X-ray, and computed tomography of abdomen and pelvic showed the massive stone burden in urinary bladder (). The urine macroscopic and microscopic examination showed presence of pus cells with white blood cells. The culture and sensitivity report of urinary sample showed growth of Escherichia coli that was highly sensitive to amikacin, gentamicin, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin.\nPatient was planned for elective surgery after treating the urinary sepsis. He underwent open cystolithotomy under general anesthesia and a total of 42 stones, weighing 1400 g, were removed. Stone were sent for chemical analysis and they turned out to be of struvite type (). Postoperative period was uneventful and he was discharged under satisfactory condition. He was followed up on outpatient department basis and was doing well."
"The patient was a 25-year-old male who has suffered with AD from infancy and who had temporarily recovered at the age of fourteen after a long period of continuous conventional treatments. No other medical history was seen except for allergic rhinitis. In August 2011, he had a right malleolus lateralis fracture and was admitted to a local orthopedics clinic. However, during the three weeks of admission, his skin condition was exacerbated after taking analgesic and antibiotic drugs every day. After that, he restarted conventional medication to alleviate the relapsed AD, but to no avail. On the 21st of December 2012, he experienced epigastric discomfort with mild fever, chills and fatigue after eating pork-boiled rice soup. The next day, rashes, pustules, vesicles and oozing abruptly appeared on his face and neck. On the 23rd, he was diagnosed in our clinic as having KVE and was hospitalized for a week. He did not take any conventional medication during whole process of the disease.\nHerbal medicine, Seungmagalgeuntang 120 mL per pack, was administered three times a day 30 minutes after each meal. Its ingredients are Pueraria Lobata 8 g, Paeonia Lactiflora 4 g, Cimicifuga Foetida 4 g, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis 4 g, Zingiber Officinale 4 g, and Allium Fistulosum 4 g. Hwangyeonhaedoktang pharmacopuncture (HP), 0.3 mL, and 25% bee venom pharmacopuncture (BVP), 0.1 mL, were perpendicularly injected at both BL13, 0.2 mL at each site, at depths of 5 mm once a day in the morning. The affected face was dressed with gauze containing a mixture of 2.0 mL of HP and 1.0 mL of 25% BVP with 20 mL of normal saline twice a day.\nOn the admission day, extensive vesicles and pustules, some of which had ruptured, oozed and crusted, appeared all over the face. The patient complained of a mild headache and a heat sensation on the face, but his vital signs were normal. Particularly, itching increased to the level of 4 on the numerical rating scale (NRS) during that nighttime while none had been seen during the day. The next day, the headache and the heat sensation totally disappeared. On the 4th day, most of the vesicles, papules, oozing and crust disappeared, but redness and scales still remained. Nighttime itching decreased to half, NRS 2. On the 7th day, facial redness and scales were all cleared. Itching almost disappeared, so he was discharged after a complete recovery (Fig )."
"A 25-year-old male patient with a history of slight vocal abnormality since childhood\npresented, in the last two years, a worsening in the quality of his voice, including\na need to make increased effort to speak, dyspnea on mild effort and night\nsnoring.\nAn otolaryngological examination showed respiratory stridor and usage of accessory\nmuscles during phonation and respiration. Nasofibrolaryngoscopy showed an expansile\ncyst-like lesion and noticeable superficial vascularization located on the right\naryepiglottic fold with partial occlusion of the glottic opening ().\nBiopsy was then performed on the lesion, and the specimen was sent for\nanatomopathological analysis. Because of the respiratory impairment, the patient was\ntracheotomized before the surgery. The patient evolved with significant edema of the\nepiglottis and the biopsied region. The patient also presented marked odynophagia,\nwhich gradually improved.\nThe patient presented intense degree of vocal deviation characterized by roughness,\nbreathiness, vocal tension and moments of diplophonia. To analyze the voice quality\nan acoustic spectrogram was performed. Acoustic spectrogram is a three-dimensional\ngraph that provides important information about frequency range (vertical axis),\ntime (horizontal axis), and amplitude (degree of browning of the tracing). In\ngeneral, the better the voice quality, the greater the stability and less noise on\nthe spectrum ().\nContrast-enhanced CT demonstrated the presence of an ill-defined hypoattenuating\nexpansile mass with heterogeneous enhancement, located in the right aryepiglottic\nfold, in the ipsilateral piriform recess. The lesion obstructed the laryngeal\nopening, with no signs of vascular or bone invasion ().\nTwo days after the biopsy, ultrasonography was performed with the patient positioned\nin dorsal decubitus with cervical hyperextension. A large, predominantly hypoechoic\nsolid mass (3.8 cm) was found in the aryepiglottic fold, inside the larynx,\noccluding almost the entire glottic opening. Such a nodule presented a slightly\nheterogeneous echotexture, with regular and well defined limits in its anterior\nportion and, ill-defined limits in its posterior portion (). A Doppler study demonstrated moderate flow with\nspectral waves revealing a resistive index ranging from 0.57 to 0.63 in the center\nand on the border of the lesion. No atypical or enlarged cervical lymph nodes were\nidentified. Ultrasonography could accurately determine that the solid mass did not\ninvade adjacent structures such as the thyroid cartilage and the adjacent\nmuscles."
"A 25-year-old pregnant female, primigravida at term was admitted in a rural hospital with hemoglobin (Hb) of 6.8 g/dl. The doctor on duty advised two units of blood transfusion. In rural India, most blood banks have no blood component facility and rely on whole blood. The blood group of the patient was detected as “O” positive. While performing minor cross-match all blood units available then showed incompatibility. Denied blood transfusion the patient was referred to our hospital, which is a tertiary care multispeciality organization with blood component facility. On investigation, we found the patient's blood group as “O” positive, but with her red cells strongly reacting (4+) with anti-A1 lectin and showing a mixed field agglutination with anti-A []. Antiglobulin test both direct and indirect were negative. Two units of compatible washed “O” positive packed RBCs (PRBCs) were issued to the patient for transfusion. Owing to minor cross-match incompatibility and patient's cells agglutinating with anti-A and anti-A1, we suspected polyagglutination and performed further investigations for confirmation as discussed before.[] Six samples of fresh normal “AB” group adult sera and three samples of cord blood sera were tested with the patient red cells at both 22°C and 4°C. Three samples of group “O” red cells were used as controls. The sera study confirmed the presence of polyagglutination as described in . We used our in-house lectin panel to detect the type of polyagglutination. The agglutination pattern with the various lectins was suggestive of Tn polyagglutination [].[] Papain treated polyagglutinable cells of the patient showed reduced agglutination strength (weak+ to +) with the adult sera used. This finding also supported the presence of Tn polyagglutination.[]"
"A 25-year-old male presented with progressive weakness of both lower limbs since 3 months. He had headaches and vomiting 1-week prior to admission. On neurological examination, the patient had spastic paraparesis. Both fundi revealed papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a well-defined lobulated intraventricular mass lesion occupying lateral ventricles, third ventricle, fourth ventricle and extending into cisterna magna through foramen of magendi [Figure and ]. The tumor literally formed a cast of the entire ventricular system. The tumor was isointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images and significant flow voids were noted. On contrast administration, heterogeneous enhancement was seen. The patient underwent right fronto-parietal parasagittal craniotomy with transcallosal radical excision of the tumor within the lateral ventricles. The tumor was soft, easily suckable and extremely vascular. Haemostasis was achieved with great difficulty. The patient deteriorated in sensorium within a few hours after surgery and had to be put on ventilatory support. Postoperative computed tomography scan demonstrated postoperative changes with residual tumor in third and fourth ventricle. There was no hydrocephalus. The patient was treated conservatively with decongestants and anticonvulsants. The patient succumbed on second postoperative day. Histological examination confirmed the lesion to be a central neurocytoma."
"A 25-year-old gravida 2, parity one pregnant woman was referred to our clinic due to sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. The pain had started approximately 8-10 hours before referral. She was admitted to a town hospital’s general surgery department and then referred to a tertiary center due to her pregnancy. The pain had been getting worse over time. She could not describe any factors modifying the pain in terms of aggravation or reduction. There were no uterine contractions. She reported having a cesarean operation 2 years before this incident. The current pregnancy was uneventful. She was followed up in a peripheral hospital in her hometown. Her pregnancy comprised 24 gestational weeks so far. The placenta was lying through the anterior uterine wall without covering the cervical os. There was a moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen. She had rebound, especially at the right lower quadrant. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg; heart rate was 92 beats/min; and body temperature was 36.4°C. Her hemoglobin (Hb) level was 8.8 g/L, her white blood cells (WBC) were 20,000/mm3 (normal range: 11.7-15.5 g/L), and her platelet level was 220,000/mm3 (normal range: 4500-11000/mm3). An emergent laparotomy was performed. Approximately 2 L of blood was removed from the abdomen. Perioperative Hb level was 5.0 g/L. Perioperatively, her blood pressure was diminished to 70/40 mm Hg with prominent tachycardia of 140 beats/min. There was uterine rupture at the isthmic level, and the placenta was protruding from the ruptured area. A vertical fundal incision was performed to avoid the placenta, and thus prevent further bleeding. The fetus, 730 g, was delivered; the cord was clamped and the placenta was left in the uterus. Due to severe bleeding from the ruptured uterine area, hysterectomy was performed. A total of 6 U erythrocyte suspension and 3 U of fresh frozen plasma were used. After the surgery, the Hb level was 8.2 g/L. She was discharged on the postoperative sixth day. The newborn died due to respiratory failure on the third day of life. The uterus () was sent for pathologic evaluation. The pathology report revealed placenta percreta."
"A 25-year-old female from rural residence, presented with sudden onset of left half of chest and left breast pain of 2 days duration. She also had pain on swallowing both liquids and solids. She did not complain of any breathlessness. She had no history of trauma, nor any prior history of retching or vomiting. There was no history of any other comorbid illness like bronchial asthma. She was not a smoker nor gave any history of substance abuse. She was married and her menstrual periods were regular, the last period was 20 days prior to presentation. On the day prior to onset of symptoms, she had manually shifted around 100 coconut fronds from her garden to a storage space.\nOn examination, she was afebrile, normotensive, with pulse rate of 78/min and respiratory rate of 18/min. Her oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. She was 161 cm tall and weighed 60 kg, with a BMI of 23.2. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema was noted over her left side of chest and left breast which was exquisitely tender. Left hemithorax crepitations (Hamman's crunch) were noted synchronous with heartbeat, but masked due to the subcutaneous emphysema. She was started on intravenous fluids and analgesics as she refused to eat due to odynophagia. Chest radiography and computed tomogram of the chest showed extensive pneumomediastinum (Figure a and b) with no evidence of pneumothorax on either side. She was discharged home after 3 days of observation, after considerable reduction of subcutaneous emphysema.\nPatient presented with recurrence of symptoms 2 months later and she had left-sided subcutaneous emphysema similar to the previous episode. She was admitted and symptoms subsided after 4 days, during which time she was only on analgesics. The third episode occurred 3 weeks later. The subcutaneous emphysema had spread to the left jaw and neck and she had severe left-sided chest tenderness. Patient was managed conservatively and was reassured about benign nature of the illness. She was discharged home after 4 days with residual symptoms and signs. On telephonic follow-up, she has remained symptom free."
"A 25-year-old unmarried native Kashmiri man, presented with a 3 months history of raised skin colored lesions over the trunk and limbs with decreased sensations of the right foot. The lesions first appeared over the upper limbs and then progressed to involve the back, chest, abdomen, lower limbs and face in that order. The lesions were asymptomatic. There was history of burning sensation in the eyes, nasal stuffiness and swelling of feet. The patient denied any drug intake, fever, arthralgias, myalgias, spontaneous blistering or ulceration and testicular pain. None of the family members had suffered from leprosy. His general physical examination was normal with no madarosis or lymphadenopathy. Cutaneous examination revealed multiple shiny, soft, hemispherical, non-tender, skin colored to erythematous papules and nodules present bilaterally on the forehead, cheeks, forearms, back, chest, the abdomen in the periumblical distribution, thighs and legs with sparing of palms and soles []. Neurological examination revealed thickened (Grade 2) bilateral greater auricular (left being tender also) [], bilateral ulnar and right radial cutaneous nerves. Pain, touch and temperature sensations were markedly diminished along the lateral border of right foot. Rest of the musculo-skeletal and neurological examination was normal. Routine hematological and biochemical investigations including urine, renal and liver function test revealed no abnormality. His retroviral serology was negative. Slit skin smear showed a full field of AFB and globi, with a BI>5+ and MI of 75%. A lesional biopsy revealed focal collections of foamy histiocytes seen beneath the atrophic epidermis []. Fite faraco staining showed cells filled with numerous AFB [] which are arranged singly, are longer than the normal bacilli, uniform in length, and are arranged in parallel bundles along the long axis of histiocytes. Findings were consistent with HL (cells contained acid fast organisms on H and E stain). So a diagnosis of de novo HL was made. The patient was given a single dose of ROM therapy as rifampicin rapidly reduces the bacillary load and ofloxacin and minocycline have strong bactericidal action. He was also instructed to take MBMDT for 1 year. The patient is on regular follow up and is free of lesions."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of recurrent proteinuria. When she was 13 years old, proteinuria was noted for the first time, and she was followed by her local outpatient clinic until the age of 22, as her proteinuria disappeared then. However, it reappeared when she was 25 years old, and thus, she was referred to our hospital. She had a past medical history of tonsillitis without gross hematuria. She was not on any medication and had no family history of proteinuria. Her height was 160 cm, body weight was 44 kg and body mass index (BMI) was 17.2 kg/m2. Clinical examination and renal ultrasound in the recumbent position were unremarkable. Her serum albumin level was 46 g/L, and her urinary protein level was 0.82 g/day, consisting mainly of albumin without hematuria or other abnormal findings in the urinary sediment, indicating the absence of active proliferative glomerular nephritis. To examine the cause of proteinuria, she was admitted to our hospital.\nInitially, we planned to perform percutaneous needle biopsy of the kidney; however, her urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio fluctuated highly [30.5–183.3 mg/mmol (270–1620 mg/g)], and we thus considered the possibility of orthostatic proteinuria (). To make a definite diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria, the next morning, we collected a urine sample with the patient lying in the recumbent position after an extended period of rest and another sample immediately after assuming the lordotic position for 5 min. The ratio of urinary protein-to-urinary creatinine increased from 18.1 mg/mmol (160 mg/g) in the recumbent position to 575.8 mg/mmol (5090 mg/g) in the lordotic position, which is regarded as nephrotic-range proteinuria. On further assessment, we found completely bland urinary sediments and an absence of serum markers, such as autoantibodies, as well as hypocomplementemia. Based on the clinical course, laboratory data and the results of the urine samples collected in the recumbent and lordotic positions, we diagnosed orthostatic proteinuria. The patient was uneventfully discharged the next day and is currently being followed twice a year. At the latest visit, her urine protein-to-urinary creatinine ratio obtained in the recumbent position was <17.0 mg/mmol (150 mg/g), and her renal function was maintained."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported for post endodontic restoration in relation to 35 (root canal treatment was done elsewhere). On removal of temporary access filling, the tooth was examined clinically and radiographically and was found suitable for SHARONLAY and the treatment was rendered [Figure -]."
"A 25-year-old male was scheduled for emergency laparotomy. He had Mallampatti class II airway with mild restriction of mouth opening. Rapid sequence induction was done with propofol 100 mg and suxamethonium 100 mg IV. Direct laryngoscopic view was Cormack–Lehane Grade III, epiglottis small, stiff, transversely folded. Both 8.0 mm and 7.0 mm endotracheal tubes failed to pass with a bougie. Finally, he was intubated with 6.5 mm tube over a bougie passed blindly below epiglottis. Anesthesia was maintained with O2/N2O/isoflurane and extubated uneventfully."
"A 25 years old female patient, primigravida at 15 weeks of gestations, had came for routine antenatal care at our outpatients clinic at Prince Rashid Bin Al-Hassan Military Hospital-Irbid-Jordan. She was seen first by a resident, history and examination was taken, besides routine antenatal investigations then she was referred to our fetal medicine clinic for anomaly scan. There is no family history of twins, and no history of exposure to any medication. At our clinic complete anomaly scan was done, the patients was found to have monozygotic twins of 15 weeks gestation and carrying a conjoint twin. Our ultrasound revealed fully developed heads facing each other, joint at the thorax and sharing a common abdomen. These twins share a single heart with two atrium and two ventricle. A large liver, two stomach, two kidneys and bowel loops were shared by the twin. Also two upper and lower limbs were seen for each fetuses. Both spines were well developed and normal. No other abnormality was seen for two fetuses (). So ultrasound diagnosis of conjoined twins of thoracopagus type was made.\nThe couple was informed about our ultrasound findings and counseled on the various management options. Then the patient went to be seen by another fetomaternal person and they confirmed our diagnosis. They decide for termination of pregnancy after taken the opinion of religious people. Termination of pregnancy was performed by many methods and we chose to use cytotec tablets which inserted vaginally, and the outcome was conjoint twin with two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly\n(). Both fetuses are female and died immediately after termination of pregnancy.\nDiagnosis of conjoined twins was made at 15 weeks, but the decision for termination of pregnancy by parents was taken after 2 weeks, actually at 18 weeks after they taken the opinion of religious people."
"A 25-year-old left-handed Caucasian female presented to the emergency department of our hospital with acute onset of dysarthria and slight right-arm weakness which she noticed upon waking up in the morning. She also complained of mild accompanying headache. She had no febrile illness prior to the onset of symptoms. Neurological examination was notable for moderate dysarthria, mild right facial palsy and bradydiadochokinesis of the right hand. MRI of the brain showed a well-circumscribed 2-cm sized concentric lamellar lesion in the left centrum semiovale. The lesion showed alternate bands of iso-/hypointensity on T1W images and alternate hypo-/hyperintensity on T2W/FLAIR images (fig. ). There was mild associated peri-lesional oedema. A concentric pattern of post-contrast enhancement was noted within the lesion (fig. ), and a rim of restricted diffusion was seen along the margins of the lesion. Imaging features were consistent with the diagnosis of BCS. Few smaller 3- to 5-mm sized ovoid T2/FLAIR hyperintense MS-like lesions were also noted in the peri-ventricular and subcortical white matter (fig. ). None of these smaller lesions showed restricted diffusion or post-contrast enhancement. MRI of the spine showed no evidence of demyelinating lesions. Laboratory tests were normal for C-reactive protein, Lyme's disease, syphilis, HIV, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and rheumatoid factor. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed less than 1 white blood cell per mm3 (normal range 0–4/mm3), glucose 3.6 mmol/l (normal range 2.4–4.2 mmol/l), and total protein 217 mg/l (normal range 200–500 mg/l). The IgG index was 0.63 (pathological if >0.7), but oligoclonal bands were present in the CSF (not in the serum), indicative of intrathecal IgG synthesis.\nThe patient was treated with high-dose (500 mg/day) oral methylprednisolone for 5 consecutive days, after which her clinical symptoms improved remarkably. A follow-up MRI at 4 months showed a more concentric appearance of the Balo lesion with regression of previously noted peri-lesional oedema, restricted diffusion and post-contrast enhancement (fig. ). Because of the additional typical MS lesions on the MRI scan and the positive oligoclonal bands in the CSF, she was started on immunomodulatory medication with interferon beta-1b. However, after 9 months of interferon treatment, she developed numbness in the right lower limb, which was suspicious of a MS relapse (i.e. dissemination in time). The third MRI (at 25 months) showed significant interval decrease in size of the Balo lesion and stable smaller MS lesions. She has had no more clinical episodes and is presently asymptomatic."
"A 25-year-old male, presented in the emergency, with a history of road traffic accident with complaints of severe pain right side chest, breathing difficulty and not able to void. Relevant clinical findings were contusion and decreased air entry in the right chest. Abdomen was clinically soft. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral hydrothorax. Bilateral intercostal tube drains were placed, drained 1500 ml and urethral catheter drained 400 ml of blood-stained urine. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan demonstrated bilateral hydrothorax, diaphragmatic rupture with stomach inside thorax and intraperitoneal rupture of the urinary bladder. Diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed diaphragmatic and urinary bladder rupture []. Laparoscopic repair of bladder rupture was done with interrupted 00 absorbable suture []. With the placement of extra ports for liver retraction, stomach reduced from the thorax. Diaphragmatic defect identified and closed with interrupted 0 non-absorbable suture []. Abdominal drain and both intercostal drains were removed, and patient was discharged on day 6th. Urethral catheter removed after 3 weeks. He had no complaints in breathing or voiding 12 months after surgery."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with complete flaccid paralysis and numbness of right upper limb. One day earlier, he had been electrocuted while holding a telephone pole with his right hand during the lightning. Immediately, following this he developed complete paralysis of right side upper limb with loss of sensation. There was no loss of consciousness, disturbance of speech, or seizure. The right side upper limb was normal on general examination with no entry burn points, bluish coloration, and all the peripheral pulses were normal. On neurologic examination, there was complete loss of all movements with power around all joints being grade 0 in right upper limb []. All modalities of sensation were absent in the same limb, excepting a very small patch in the uppermost part of right arm where it was reduced to 20% of that on left side. Nerve conduction study done on 5th day after the lightning injury, showed grossly diminished conduction velocity and increased distal latencies in all the major nerves of right upper limb without any decrease in amplitude. Electromyography showed no fibrillations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neck showed normal brachial plexus with no avulsion or pseudomeningocele formation []. Patient was put on steroid therapy (20 mg prednisolone thrice daily for 2 weeks) followed by tapering doses for a total of 6 weeks. An arm sling was given to support the paralysed limb. On follow-up, 1 week after starting the steroid therapy, power in right hand had improved; he could open and close his fist, write with bad hand writing (with support from left hand). However, there was no recovery of muscle function in forearm and arm muscles. There was restoration of sensations in right side upper limb to 30% of normal. On completion of 2nd follow-up week, power in right hand grossly improved with ability to write properly and do routine activities. Patient was able to raise his forearm against gravity (Grade 3 power). Abduction at shoulder joint was possible to only 30° []. Sensation improved to 75% of normal. Twenty days after starting the steroid therapy, power in forearm muscles improved to grade 5, abduction at shoulder increased to 70–80°. There was complete recovery of sensation in right upper limb. At the end of 4th week course of steroid therapy, patient had regained complete power of muscles and sensations in right upper limbs. Now he could raise his right arm to full extent, do normal routine activities with his hand, forearm, and arm []. Nerve conduction study done at the end of 5th week showed 80% recovery in conduction velocity and distal latencies."
"A 25-year-old HCV-positive male with a history of IV drug abuse for the past 3 years presented to our institution with complaint of pain lower abdomen and frank hematuria after receiving a minimal blow to his lower abdomen by his 4-year-old daughter during her play 6 days back. On arrival to our emergency room, the patient was conscious oriented tachycardic with a diffuse nonpainful nontender swelling in his right groin. Rest of his vitals and general examination was within normal limits. Distal pulsation in the right leg was present. His hemoglobin was 6.3 g% and CBC was high. Ultrasonogram of abdomen and pelvis revealed distended urinary bladder with clots and pseudoaneurysm of right common femoral artery measuring ∼112 × 69 × 87 mm (Fig. ). The patient was planned for urinary bladder exploration along with evacuation of clot by urology team by cystoscopy after adequate resuscitation. During cystoscopy, nothing was visible due to massive clot inside the bladder which was incompletely evacuated so three-way Foley catheter was left in situ for continuous postoperative irrigation. Postoperatively, hematuria continued despite transfusion and, hence, emergent abdominal pelvic CT scan was performed.\nOn contrast enhanced CT, a right common femoral pseudoaneurysm of size 12.5 × 6 × 6.5 cm was noted with intra-abdominal extension. Huge clot was also noted in the bladder with no obvious lesion in the kidney, ureter and bladder (Fig. ). Thus, the patient was planned for exploration of pseudoaneurysm and urinary bladder. On exploration of right groin, there was a huge pseudoaneurysm in the groin extending above the inguinal ligament with 1 l of clot and blood (Fig. ). Femoral artery was transected and proximal and distal ends were taken into control. Proximal end of femoral artery was ligated, and the leg was examined for distal saturation which was normal, so the distal end was also ligated. After addressing the femoral artery, the urinary bladder was explored. A small rent (∼0.5 × 0.5 cm) was noted in the right lateral wall of the bladder which was communicating with the wall of the pseudoaneurysm along with 2 l of blood and clot in the bladder. Thus, the enigma of hematuria was solved. Bladder was repaired according to standard technique and drain was kept in retroperitoneal space and abdomen was closed.\nPostoperatively, the patient had a speedy recovery and was discharged on the 7th postoperative day with Foley's catheter in situ. The distal limb is viable and the wound healing is satisfactory. Foley's catheter was removed after 2 weeks and the patient is doing well till date."
"A 25-year-old female patient reported with a chief complaint of swelling on the palate since 1 year. The swelling extended from the rugae area to the 1st molar on the left side. The swelling did not cross the mid-palatine suture. Radiographically, a unilocular radiolucency was seen in association with the grossly carious first molar. Excision was performed. We received a single piece of tissue. On stereomicroscopic examination, we could see a lumen with few irregular proliferations into the cystic cavity. A fibrous capsule of varying thickness was also seen with area of brownish discoloration which could be suggestive of hemorrhagic area. On grossing, this was suggestive of a cystic lesion []. On microscopic examination, it was confirmed as radicular cyst which was lined by epithelium over an inflamed connective tissue stroma. A thick capsule was also seen around the stroma [Figure and ]."
"A 25-year-old woman with a history of FSGS was admitted to our facility with severe headache, double vision, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status, with subsequent development of seizure. Prior to the seizure, the patient’s systolic blood pressure was severely elevated at 230 mmHg. She was not on any immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs. Due to her altered mental status, the patient was sedated and intubated and a full review of symptoms was unattainable.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was promptly obtained and it revealed the presence of diffuse vasogenic edema and a small SAH on the cortical surface. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head was performed to determine the source of hemorrhage and no aneurysm, vessel stenosis, or arteriovenous malformation was evident. CT angiography was not performed due to coexisting chronic renal disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed patchy bilateral supratentorial areas of T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery cortical hyperintensity in the parieto-occipital lobe, which suggested the development of PRES ().\nThe patient’s blood pressure stabilized with treatment and she was subsequently extubated. Neurological exam revealed no focal neurological deficits. There were no definite visual field abnormalities and remaining cranial nerves were also intact. The patient displayed good motor and sensory function bilaterally. There were evident signs of nephrotic syndrome including generalized anasarca, but the rest of the exam was otherwise unremarkable.\nLaboratory data revealed hemoglobin (8.2 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen (41 mmol/L), creatinine (2.01 mol/L), and hypoalbuminemia (1.9 g/dL). Urinalysis revealed total urine protein greater than 810 mg/dL, urine protein to creatinine ratio of 9.20, and the presence of hyaline and granular casts. Additionally, the patient’s BNP was 923 pg/mL.\nThe patient was treated with antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, hydralazine) and diuretics to control her blood pressure and volume overload. Additionally, prednisone was started for the underlying FSGS. Over the course of her hospital stay, the patient did not develop additional seizures and regained full consciousness over the course of her admission. Subsequent MRI of the brain 10 days after the seizure onset demonstrated almost complete resolution of the initial edematous change. There was resolution of the nephrotic syndrome after 2 weeks treatment with diuresis and prednisone."
"A 25-year-old woman with one previous normal spontaneous vaginal delivery was referred to our team for an immediate left breast reconstruction for a phylloides tumour – BIRADS III.\nShe first presented to the hospital with a 9-month history of a left breast lump measuring 6 cm × 7 cm. The patient was 2 months pregnant. The initial biopsy showed a benign proliferative lesion with nuclear atypia. The patient received regular follow-up. It was noted that the swelling increased in size during each follow-up until it involved all four quadrants. An ultrasound examination suggested that the mass was a phylloides tumour – BIRADS III. Despite that fact, the patient refused surgery at that time.\nAfter 2 years of follow-up and counselling, the patient finally agreed to the operation. Clinically, her left breast mass measured 20 cm × 15 cm. She underwent a simple mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction with a unilateral pedicled TRAM flap [].\nThe TRAM flap was raised with the preservation of the rectus sheath as much as possible by identifying the perforators. The flap was transferred and inset, and the rectus sheath was closed primarily using a loop 0 ethilon. Post-operatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery.\nAt the 2-month follow-up, she was confirmed be 11 weeks pregnant. Both the plastic surgeon and the obstetrician closely monitored her pregnancy. The abdominal wall gradually expanded, according to the stages of pregnancy, without any signs of herniation. At 8 months gestation, a review of her abdominal wall indicated that the integrity was preserved and remarkably, there was little or no change in the width of the donor site scar [Figure and ]. A healthy 2.8 kg baby girl was born at term following an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery.\nThe postpartum follow-up was uneventful. The patient presented to our clinic 2 months post-delivery with no complaints. She had a well-preserved abdominal wall integrity and function with no signs of herniation []."
"In August 2005, a 25-year-old woman on hemodialysis was referred to our renal clinic with a positive pregnancy test based on serum beta HCG. She had end-stage renal disease secondary to type 1 diabetes and had started dialysis 9 months prior to her visit. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks prior to the visit. She had had two previous pregnancies, the first resulting in spontaneous abortion in the first trimester and the second resulting in the delivery of a baby at 30 weeks gestation. The second pregnancy was in 2001. She was not told that she had kidney disease during her previous pregnancies. Her past medical history was significant for diabetes since age 9 with retinopathy and nephropathy. She was not aware of any kidney disease until she reached the point of needing dialysis in September 2004 and had been on thrice weekly dialysis since then. Her medications included insulin, RenaGel, PhosLo, folic acid and MVI. On exam, her BP was 112/67 mm Hg and she did not have any edema. Her beta HCG levels were 13 270 mIU/mL at the time of her pregnancy test and increased to 30 232 mIU/mL within 3 days. The plan was to increase her dialysis regimen to more than 20 h per week and she was referred to the care of high-risk obstetrics. She had a transvaginal ultrasound scan, which showed an intra-uterine gestational sac of 5.3 weeks, but no fetal heart tone could be detected. Given that she had HCG levels consistent with 7 or more weeks gestation without visible cardiac activity, she was thought to have a non-viable pregnancy and surgical termination was contemplated once her blood sugars were well controlled. Beta HCG levels were followed with the expectation that they would drop in the setting of a non-viable pregnancy. Her beta HCG levels are charted below:\nA transvaginal ultrasound was repeated in 10 days and showed an intra-uterine pregnancy consistent with a gestational age of 7 weeks and with good fetal heart tones at a rate of 128 bpm. She continued with her pregnancy and was started on 5 × weekly dialysis. Although, in the second trimester, she had an abnormal triple antigen screening test for fetal abnormalities, she delivered a healthy baby weighing 3.5 kg at 32 weeks without any further complications."
"A 25-year-old unemployed male with no history of trauma or sinusitis presented with the complaints of severe bi-temporal headache accompanied with the fits of dizziness associated nausea, vomiting, and early papilledema. Examination showed a conscious and oriented young man who was able to communicate well but was clinically dehydrated (urea level raised to 55 mmol/L) His lumbar tap showed normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Direct mycological examination of CSF was negative. His hematological and biochemical parameters were within normal limits except that he had a raised white blood cell count (15,900 cu/ml) with poly-morphnuclear leukocytosis (93%) and signs of microcytic hypochromic anemia. He was negative for human immunodeficiency virus test and hepatitis B surface antigen test.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain showed a well-defined round to oval space occupying lesion with marked peri-lesional white matter edema in the right fronto-parietal lobe []. Postcontrast MRI brain axial image showed well-defined peripheral ring enhancement with mild lobulation along the inferior surface with no obvious solid enhancing component []. Thereby favoring the diagnosis of cerebral abscess with the least possible diagnosis of glioma. The patient was subjected to surgery. The brain specimen was multiple, irregular, friable grayish to grayish-white soft tissue mass bits of 2.5 cm × 2 cm × 1 cm that was sent for pathological investigation in the surgical pathology laboratory. The histopathological sections showed mixed inflammatory infiltration in the brain tissue with giant cells showing brown-colored, branched septate hyphae [Figures and ].\nDirect mycological examination of the cerebral tissue with 20% KOH showed the presence of elongated, branched, septate pigmented hyphae. Fragments of surgical brain specimen were cultured on 4% Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) with chloramphenicol (50 mg/L). Incubation at 42°C revealed velvety, olive gray to brown growth on obverse and dark tan on the reverse of the SDA slant after 10 days of incubation. The etiological agent was identified as Cladophilophora bantiana (Xylohypha bantiana) and the final impression of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis was given.\nThe patient responded well to the surgical excision combined with antifungal therapy using itraconazole for 2 months. Unfortunately, the patient was lost for follow-up."
"Patient 9, a 25-year-old man, presented in June 1929 with suboccipital headaches associated with vomiting. The patient reported that in May 1929, while fatigued from a long car drive, he endured a severe suboccipital headache and vomiting. He also experienced seizures that consisted of neck retraction, dizziness, sweating, eye protrusion, and arm flexure. Cushing wrote that the patient was reportedly taken to the hospital in late May for “gastric symptoms.”[] On examination, the patient had a rigid neck, bilateral abducens palsy, bilateral Babinski reflex, hyperreflexia, and a choked disc of 4 diopters. Ventriculograms showed some evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus at the foramina of Monro and a filling defect of the third ventricle. He was given four radiation (X-ray) treatments and the pressure symptoms subsided for 1 year.\nIn 1931, his gastric symptoms returned, and a recurrence of the tumor was suspected. He received three additional radiation treatments, and the symptoms disappeared. However, the symptoms recurred again in January 1932. These symptoms were more indicative of a duodenal ulcer. He received radiation at the third ventricle, and he improved. However, several weeks later on March 3, barium studies confirmed the presence of a healed duodenal ulcer following the radiation therapy.[]"
"Case 1. A 25-year-old woman began having seizures at the age of 8. Seizures would start during bathing with dizziness followed by left arm posturing, rarely progressing to secondary generalization. She had normal development, with no history of trauma, febrile convulsions, or family history of reflex epilepsy. Bathing was eastern-style. She had been treated with carbamazepine 400 mg/day. At the age of 16, seizures abated and medication was stopped. At the age of 24, seizures recurred after three months post-partum, with above symptomatology. Brain CT scan was normal. Interictal EEG was also normal. Carbamazepine was restarted, and seizure freedom followed."
"A 25-year-old man with a history of herpes esophagitis 6 years prior to admission presented with progressive dysphagia and a palpable and painless right cervical mass for the past approximately 5 months.\nComputed tomography (CT) and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography revealed an eccentric hypermetabolic mass (4.1×6.8 cm; SUV >12) in the right esophageal wall, causing an important mass effect with tracheal and esophageal deviation. Neither lymph nodes nor other organs were involved ().\nThe pathology report on the neck biopsy informed of an immature neoplasm with round and basophil cell proliferation forming a diffuse infiltrate compatible with round cell malignancy (). The immunohistochemical study revealed intense expression of CD99/MIC2 +, c-kit +, FLI-1 + and Ki67 + in 60% of the neoplastic cells (). The rest of the tumor markers were negative. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) identified a chimeric EWSR1/ERG fusion transcript distinctive of the t(21;22) (q22;q21) translocation. To our surprise, RT-PCR revealed two splice variants coexisting within the same tumor (EWSR1(ex7)-ERG(ex6) and EWSR1(ex7)-ERG(ex7)) (). The diagnosis of extraskeletal Ewing’s sarcoma with high proliferation was confirmed.\nChemotherapy based on the therapeutic schedule vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide alternated with ifosfamide and etoposide every 3 weeks was administered for a total of 17 cycles. Locoregional treatment consisted of radiation therapy with a total dose of 54 Gy performed from the fourth month, while receiving concomitant chemotherapy.\nComplete response after eight cycles was achieved, and the patient remained asymptomatic for 1 month after the last chemotherapy cycle. Subsequently, progressive dysphonia was detected, and laryngoscopy revealed right vocal cord paralysis, while the CT scan showed a well-delimited paraesophageal mass (4.5 cm) suggesting local recurrence. The latter was confirmed by the histological study ().\nAfter relapse, the patient was treated with a combination of irinotecan and temozolomide. Following the first cycle, he experienced rapid clinical progression. High-dose ifosfamide was therefore administered, with no clinical benefit after one cycle. Considering the aggressiveness of the disease, a gemcitabine-docetaxel regimen was started. The tumor remained totally refractory to chemotherapy after three cycles, with both locoregional and lung progression.\nRegrettably, the patient died suddenly secondary to airway obstruction caused by progression of the disease."
"A 25-yr-old man had a 5-yr history of cough and dyspnea on 28th March 2007. Initial FEV1 was 2.51 L (62.6%), FVC was 3.65 L (77.8%), and FEV1/FVC was 68.8%. BD response was negative. The results of a MBPT were positive (PC20 4.36 mg/mL). A CXR showed miliary nodules in both lungs, but he didn't have sinusitis. A chest CT showed bronchiolectasis and centrilobular nodules on both lungs (). Induced sputum showed severe eosinophilia (42%). The AFB studies were negative. He took inhaled fluticasone combined with salmeterol, montelukast, and theophylline, and he intermittently used 30 mg of prednisolone (PL) for asthma attacks. After the patient took clarithromycin 250 mg twice a day for 9 months, his FEV1 improved from 62.6% to 88.4%, and he could reduce the amount of PL. Before the patient had started taking clarithromycin, he had taken 720 mg of PL per year. After he treated with clarithromycin, he was able to reduce use of oral steroids by about 80%, such that he took 150 mg per year."
"A female patient in her twenties came to the clinic with the chief complaints of crowding and a gummy smile. The patient showed mild crowding with excessive gingival display and relatively short clinical crown height (). Molar and canine occlusion showed a Class I relationship.\nThe patient desired simple anterior alignment without changes to her molar occlusion. Therefore, the treatment objectives were set to improve anterior alignment and incisor display only. Esthetic mini-tubes and two-dimensional lingual brackets were bonded to the six anterior teeth of the maxilla and the mandible respectively. To improve the anterior dental esthetics, gingivectomy was planned with mild intrusion of the maxillary anterior teeth. Two self-drilling orthodontic miniscrews (1016107; Ortholution, Seoul, Korea) were inserted distal to the maxillary canines at the mucogingival junction, to apply intrusive force similar to that of J-hook headgear ().8 After 4 months, appliances were removed following gingivectomy ().\nAfter 3 years, the occlusion itself was stably maintained. However, small whitish lumps were observed at the miniscrew sites. The lesions were distinguished from the adjacent tissue by a protuberant appearance and whitish coloration ( at greater magnification). There was no associated discomfort, or pain on palpation, but it was visually distinct from the adjacent gingiva and the mucosa. The lesions were exposed at full smile, and the patient felt self-conscious and desired removal of the lesions.\nThe lesions were clinically diagnosed as scars remaining after the removal of miniscrews.7 The scar tissues were excised as a form of scar revision under local anesthesia. After 3 months, the sites became flat (). Histologic evaluation of excisional biopsy samples of the scar and adjacent tissue confirmed hyperkeratosis, and dense collagen fibers of the dermis with flat and smoother rete pegs compared to the adjacent gingival tissue ()."
"A 25-year-old woman visited our hospital because of fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting in December 2013. She had no histories of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drug use, and travel outside Korea. She had had recurrent periodic fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting since she was 21 years. Symptoms recurred every 6 months at first, but the interval between symptoms gradually decreased to 3 months. She experienced intermittent attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, and fever (39-40℃) for 3 to 5 days, and then the symptoms resolved spontaneously and completely. She had a normal daily life during the symptom-free period. A year prior to her visit in our hospital, she underwent several blood tests, abdominal CT, and gastroscopy in another hospital; her CT scan and small bowel follow-through () showed complete intestinal nonrotation. Antibody screening test results for infection and autoimmune diseases were all negative. She underwent exploratory laparotomy and appendectomy in May 2012 to exclude adhesions due to intestinal nonrotation and other surgical causes of abdominal pain and fever. No significant adhesions or bowel torsion was observed. After surgery, she became pregnant, had no symptoms during pregnancy, and gave birth in March 2013. In December 2013, she again had abdominal pain and vomiting with fever and visited our hospital immediately after the first symptomatic attack since pregnancy.\nVital signs were blood pressure 110/73 mm Hg, pulse 80/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and body temperature 37.0℃ on admission. Mild diffuse abdominal tenderness was noted. Initial laboratory results showed leukocytes 9,200/mm3 (neutrophils 75.9%), hemoglobin 12.3 g/dL, platelets 218,000/mm3, and CRP 4.4 mg/L.\nOn the basis of her typical symptoms, FMF or tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome were most likely among the periodic fever syndromes. We performed MEFV and TNFR1 genetic testing for the definitive diagnosis of FMF. Two missense mutations were detected in the exon 2 of the MEFV gene, a heterozygous mutation of c.329T>C (p.Leu110Pro) and a homozygous mutation of c.442G>C (p.Glu148Gln). Based on the presence of periodic fever and abdominal pain and the result of the MEFV gene mutation analysis, this patient was diagnosed with FMF.\nThe patient remains asymptomatic on colchicine 1.2 mg/day, but needs to be followed to confirm that colchicine controls recurrent symptoms."
"A 25-year-old lady presented with long standing chronic shoulder pain. She had this pain since adolescence, and during these years, she had tried every local and systemic treatment such as various kinds of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), local steroid injections, and physiotherapy sessions. Her pain was described as diffuse, vague and chronic, with no significant limitation of motion. Her pain was worse at night and has caused multiple episodes of sleep interruption during the night.\nPhysical examination, showed significant tenderness on the clavicle. Laboratory findings including CBC (complete blood count), CRP (C-reactive protein), ESR (Erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and all the biochemical tests were completely unremarkable.\nWith the clinical impression of musculoskeletal and joint inflammatory disorder, she has received NSAID, with no significant change in the intensity of pain. Then she scheduled for physiotherapy sessions, and starting the first session, caused worsening of the shoulder pain. After that, intra-articular steroid has been injected, but no permanent relief was achieved.\nAfter the failure of these conservative therapies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed with GAD. shows the MRI by GAD, which shows a large heterogeneous enhancing mass in supraclavicular area with extension to clivus. Bony parts were unremarkable.\nThe patient was scheduled for operation and complete excision was performed. During the operation the origin of tumor seemed to be from right supraclavicular region adjacent to periosteum of clavicle.\nThe specimen received in the pathology lab is shown in . As the figure shows, it was a large tumor with brown color and cystic spaces filled with blood clot.\nHistologic sections of the tumor showed small and round uniform cells with indistinct cytoplasmic borders, no mitosis, and no atypia. No necrosis has been identified. With the primary impression of glomus tumor, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. IHC staining showed positive CD31, factor 8 antigen, vimentin and smooth muscle actin (SMA). The cells were negative with cytokeratin, CD99, and leukocyte common antigen (LCA). Ki-67 was very low and less than 1% ().\nThe tumor was diagnosed as benign glomus tumor, however according to the large size, and deep location, a note was added to the pathology report about the high risk of recurrence and possibility of metastasis."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a firm, painless, bluish, slow growing lesion in the upper lip, which was clinically diagnosed as papilloma. Excision of the mass was done and sent for histopathology examination. The H and E sections showed a dilated vessel with an organized thrombus and numerous papillae with a connective tissue core, lined by a single layer of endothelial cells with no atypia, necrosis and mitosis. The lesion was well-circumscribed and contained inside the vascular wall. Thus malignancy was excluded and a diagnosis of IPEH (Masson's hemangioma) of the lip [Figures and ] was made."
"A 25-year-old healthy woman presented with a 2-year history of an itchy erythematous plaque on the right ear pinna. She had no fever, weight loss or other systemic symptoms. The patient had been treated with oral cephalexin, ciprofloxacin and anti-tuberculous agents without improvement. She had had her right ear pierced by a beautician 8 months before the lesion developed. Skin examination revealed ill-defined scaly erythematous and slightly edematous plaque, with small nodules on the rim of the right ear pinna and preauricular area (fig. ). There was no lymphadenopathy. The results of the rest of the physical examinations were normal. Laboratory investigations, including routine blood tests, liver and renal functions, and chest radiography were all within normal limits. HIV antibody testing was negative.\nA punch biopsy was performed from the right preauricular area. Histological examination demonstrated superficial and deep perivascular and nodular inflammatory cell infiltration admixed with lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells and multinucleated giant cells forming small foci of granuloma (fig. ). Non-pigmented septate hyphae were also seen within the granuloma (fig. ). Periodic acid-Schiff stain highlighted fungal hyphae (fig. ). The histological finding and laboratory investigations suggested a diagnosis of cutaneous hyalohyphomycosis. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on the colony sample using the gene fragment, and BLASTN search against the GenBank database revealed a 98% nucleotide sequence identity to Chrysosporium spp.\nBased on the above findings, we diagnosed the patient as primary cutaneous hyalohyphomycosis from Chrysosporium spp. She was treated with oral itraconazole 200 mg per day, which resulted in mild improvement of the dermatosis. Therefore, the serum itraconazole trough level, which was measured just before the next dose administration, was investigated. Using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay, the itraconazole trough level in this patient was 0.118 μg/ml, which is not enough for the therapeutic concentration for localized infection (>0.5 μg/ml) [, ]. The dose was adjusted to 400 mg per day and the drug trough level after 7 days of administration was 0.572 μg/ml, showing dramatic improvement. The treatment was continued for a total of 8 months. No recurrence was observed during a 3-month follow-up after treatment had been discontinued."
"A 25-year-old female presented with pain abdomen and bleeding per vaginum for 25 days. She was febrile and anemic with occasional bouts of vomiting. She had a past history of right-sided ectopic gestation 1 year back. Abdominal examination revealed a soft, non-tender palpable lump in the right iliac fossa. Her hemoglobin level was 8.6 gm%. Her urine tested negative for βhCG and the serum level was slightly increased to 3080 mIU. The chest radiograph was normal. Ultrasonography showed a right-sided tubo-ovarian mass. The ovary was enlarged and showed a hyperechoic heterogeneous mass. The uterus was normal appearing without intrauterine pregnancy or gestational sac. On laparotomy, the right ovary was replaced by a hemorrhagic, friable and necrotic mass. The uterus and fallopian tubes were found to be normal. A portion of the ovarian mass was immediately removed for intra-operative cytology. Imprint cytosmears were prepared from the mass and fixed with absolute alcohol and stained with Papanicolaou stain and hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stain. Two cytopathologists examined the smears, which showed small clusters of pleomorphic and hyperchromatic cells with clear to pale eosinophilic cytoplasm over a hemorrhagic and necrotic background [Figure and ]. Occasional multinucleated giant cells (syncytiotrophoblasts) were also seen. There was conspicuous absence of other cellular elements. Considering the clinical presentation, a provisional diagnosis of choriocarcinoma was given. The patient then underwent total hysterectomy with right-sided salpingo-oophorectomy. We received the gross specimen as cut-opened uterus with cervix and a large hemorrhagic and friable mass. The ovarian mass measured 10 cm × 8 cm × 6 cm. It was grayish white to hemorrhagic and necrotic []. Sections were taken from different areas of the ovarian mass along with uterine wall and cervix and stained with H&E stain after processing. Histopathology revealed mostly areas of hemorrhage and necrosis with a biphasic tumor tissue comprising of pleomorphic cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. The sections were also subjected toKi67 immunostain and were found to be positive with diffuse and intense staining (in more than 50% of cytotrophoblasts) showing high proliferative index of the tumor cells []. In contrast, the syncytiotrophoblasts were negative for Ki67. The uterine wall showed non-secretory endometrium over unremarkable myometrium. Therefore, a final diagnosis of primary gestational ovarian choriocarcinoma was given."
"A 25-year-old male presented with history of a viper bite, was systemically stable and received ASV. There was a history of pain and redness OU since the bite. On examination the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6 / 12 OU, and anterior chamber showed grade 3 cells and flare. The remainder of the ocular examination was normal. The patient was diagnosed with acute anterior uveitis OU and was started on topical steroids and cycloplegics for one week, and uveitis resolved completely and visual acuity returned to normal."
"A 25-year-old woman, parity status P1 + 0, weighing 50 kg, presented in early labor at term with a history of loss of fetal movement and cesarean section in the earlier pregnancy. On admission, she was fully oriented with a pulse rate of 80/min and BP of 130/70 mmHg, and the fetal heart sounds were equivocal. She was put up for emergency lower segment cesarean section under spinal anesthesia and premedicated with ranitidine 50 mg by intramuscular (IM) route and metoclopramide 10 mg IM in the labor room before being brought into the operation theater (OT).\nIn the OT, her vitals were taken which showed pulse 76/min, BP 140/72 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98% in room air. Intravenous (IV) cannulation was done with an 18G cannula and ringer lactate infusion started. Urinary catheterization was done. Spinal anesthesia was administered, in the sitting posture, at the L2-L3 interspace with a 25G Quincke's spinal needle by the anesthesia junior resident. The intended drug was hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% W/V, and the volume administered was 2.6 mL. Immediately upon assuming the supine position, the patient started complaining of acute pain in both lower limbs along with intense burning sensation. She became restless with pulse rising to 150/min and BP to 190/110 mmHg. The situation was rescued by converting to general anesthesia by propofol 100 mg IV, intubating with the help of succinylcholine 50 mg IV and maintaining with nitrous oxide 60% and oxygen 40% inhalation. Muscle relaxation was continued with atracurium 25 mg IV in two divided doses (20 mg + 5 mg). The cesarean section was completed without problems and a 2.4 kg live baby was delivered. The baby cried immediately after birth and Apgar at 5 min was nine. Following intubation, the mother's pulse was 86/min and BP was 130/80 mmHg. Pulse and BP remained stable throughout the operation (40 min). Fentanyl 50 mcg IV was given after delivery of the baby. Relaxation was reversed by neostigmine 2.5 mg IV with glycopyrrolate 400 mcg IV, and nitrous oxide was withdrawn after recovery of spontaneous respiration. The patient was extubated uneventfully and did not complain of any further leg pain or burning sensation after recovery from anesthesia.\nVital signs remained normal postoperatively, and the patient was shifted to the postnatal ward. She was discharged in normal course and suffered no neurological sequelae. The case was not reported to the hospital administration as there is no system of medication error reporting in the institution."
"A 25-year-old male presented with intermittent right quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice for 5 years. He had been investigated in the past for his symptoms and was carrying multiple biochemical and ultrasound reports documenting the presence of hyperbilirubinemia and cholelithiasis with bilobar fusiform biliary dilatation. He was advised surgery in the past, but had refused to undergo the same. Increasing frequency of the symptoms forced him to seek a definitive therapy.\nAbdominal MRI and MRCP revealed cholelithiasis and gross fusiform dilatation of right, left, and common hepatic ducts. Calculus was seen in the dilated right hepatic duct. The cystic duct was dilated, tortuous, and opened into normal caliber CBD with a narrow neck [Figure -]. A diagnosis of type IV choledochal cyst with cystic duct involvement and cholelithiasis was made. Open cholecystectomy with complete excision of the dilated extrahepatic biliary ducts was done and continuity was established with roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy for right and left ducts separately. The hepatolithiasis were retrieved during surgery."
"A 25-year-old Korean male was admitted due to 3 days′ history of hematochezia. Two weeks earlier, he had visited the outpatient clinic due to intermittent dull left lower quadrant pain and loose stool of 3 months′ duration. He had mild exertional dyspnea. Faint pansystolic murmur was audible along his left sternal border. A firm tender mass of 3–4 cm in size was palpable at his left lower abdomen. Colonoscopy revealed a small pedunculated polyp on the cecum and another small sessile polyp on the sigmoid colon The two polyps were removed with polypectomy. The mucosal folds were hypertrophic and the lumen was slightly narrow over a long segment of the sigmoid colon. Histologic examination of the removed polyps revealed lymphoid polyps. Mucosal biopsy from the narrow segment of the sigmoid colon disclosed only mild infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells.\nOn admission, his vital signs were stable. Hemoglobin was 11.0g/dl. Upper GI endoscopy was unremarkable. Colonoscopy revealed a small shallow ulceration at the previous polypectomy site on the cecum, and any evidence of recent bleeding could not be noted. Four days later, he experienced mild hematochezia again without any significant change in blood pressure and heart rate. Urgent sigmoidoscopy revealed fresh blood up to the splenic flexure, but the bleeding point was not clear.\nSelective inferior mesenteric arteriography demonstrated abnormal vasculature involving the sigmoid and distal descending colon without active bleeding (). Echocardiography and right cardiac catheterization demonstrated a ventricular septal defect with Qp/Qs ratio of 1.99. On the next day of the cardiac catheterization, he experienced a sudden massive lower GI bleeding and became hypotensive. On urgent laparotomy, a long abnormally hard thickened colonic segment with dilated tortuous vasculature involving the distal descending colon, sigmoid colon and upper rectum was found. Segmental colectomy, including the involved segment, was done. Post-resection barium angiography was done and the finding was similar to that of the preoperative angiography and confirmed the completeness of the resection. Barium enema was done with the resected specimen showing markedly thickened bowel wall (). The cut surface of the bowel wall demonstrated multiple ectatic blood vessels throughout the entire thickness of the wall (). Histology revealed abnormal ectaticvasculature () and a bleeding point could be identified ().\nHis postoperative course was uneventful. A cardiac surgeon recommended open heart surgery for his ventricular septal defect, but he refused because he felt that his dyspnea was tolerable. He was discharged in a relatively good general condition."
"A 25 year-old female presented herself to a local clinic because of exposure to phogene. She had been in excellent health until September 8, 1995, when she was exposed to phosgene. She complained of coughing, chest tightness and dyspnea which were not relieved despite therapy with oxygen. She was transferred to CNUH about six hours after exposure.\nAdmitting vital signs were blood pressure 100/60 mmHg. pulse 110/min, respiration 20/min, temperature 36.4°C. Examination of the chest revealed bilateral inspiratory and expiratory crackles. The chest X-ray showed diffuse increased haziness on both lung field (). The WBC were 12.7 × 103/μl, the LDH 409 unit, initial arterial blood gases determinations on room air were, PaO2, 68.9 mmHg, PaCO2, 34.7 mmHg, pH, 7.392.\nThe patient was treated with a face mask with 8 L/min oxygen. On the second day of admission, she was transferred to the ICU with respiratory insufficiency. She had progressively increasing respiratory symptoms with the respiratory rate rising to 44/min, pulse rate to 114/min and blood pressure decreasing 70/40 mmHg. The WBC were 25.2 × 103/μl with 95.6% neutrophils and LDH was 665 unit. The arterial blood gases were PaO2, 41.2 mmHg, PaCO2 34.9 mmHg, pH, 7.364. The patient was intubated and ventilated with controlled mode and 8.0 cmH2O of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was applied. Two hours after ventilation, the patient became cyanotic and oxygen saturation decreased to 60% and a chest X-ray showed pneumothorax on the right thoracic cavity. Chest tube was inserted with a water seal bottle. Five hours after controlled ventilation, arterial blood gases on FiO2 0.6 were PaO2, 60.4 mmHg, PaCO2, 31.3 mmHg, pH, 7.520. Ventilation was controlled with diazepam and vecuronium to reduce anxiety and fighting.\nOn the third day of ventilation, she was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. The patient received methylprednisolone (500 mg) for 7 days, 2 days of furosemide (120 mg), aminophylline, dopamine and antibiotics from the day of admission.\nOn the fifteenth day following exposure, pulmonary function tests showed a restrictive pattern and the diffusion capacity was within the normal limit (). A follow-up chest X-ray was cleared to normal ()."
"A 25-year-old male football player presented with a single intensely itchy eruption on right thigh. On examination, a single serpentine lesion of size 0.2 × 5 cm present on the medial side of the right thigh []."
"A 25-year-old Chinese man presented with a 1-year history of a recurrent, pruritic, target-like and palpable rash. This was also associated with an intermittent fever over a 3-month period, which would result in occasional night sweats. There was no loss of weight or appetite. Histology of a skin biopsy done in another laboratory was reported as a lobular panniculitis. No immunohistochemistry was performed. The lesions would improve with courses of oral corticosteroid but reappeared when the medication was being tapered off. He subsequently sought a second opinion with our hospital.\nOn examination, widespread infiltrated purpuric plaques were seen over his trunk []. On his back, there were large annular rings, some with central necrotic crusts []. Petechiae were present in areas where pressure had been applied []. There was no significant peripheral lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.\nBlood investigations revealed pancytopenia (leukocyte count 3.9 × 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count 3000/uL). Inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) were not elevated. Autoimmune workup with anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), complement studies and anti-extractable nuclear antigens were unremarkable. Infective screens for dengue and retroviral disease were also negative.\nAn initial biopsy performed in our center had only a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate and did not sample sufficient subcutaneous fat to assess for a possible panniculitic process. A deeper skin biopsy revealed atypical cytotoxic T-cell infiltrates in the dermis and in a panniculitic pattern, consistent with SPTCL [Figures and ]. The lymphocytes showed small to medium-sized nuclei and were seen to rim around the adipocytes.\nOn immunohistochemical analysis, the lesional lymphocytes were reactive for CD3, CD8, Granzyme-B and Beta-F1. They were negative for TIA-1, CD4, CD56, CD20 and EBER (EBV encoded RNA)-in situ hybridization. The histiocytes were reactive for CD68 but not for myeloperoxidase.\nBone marrow studies showed marked hemophagocytosis []. A full body positron emission tomography (PET) and computer tomography scan revealed only minimal subcentimeter nodes in the cervical, axillary, retroperitoneal, mesenteric and inguinal regions, which are non-specific. There was no bulky lymph node involvement.\nThe patient was started on oral dexamethasone and cyclosporine for suppression of hemophagocytosis before choosing to return to his home country for definitive chemotherapy. Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole and acyclovir prophylaxis were also commenced."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics of our institution with a chief complaint of bilateral swellings in relation to the lower right and left posterior teeth since the last 2 months. The patient gave a history of an occasional dull aching pain in relation to the swellings. There was no relevant medical history. Clinical examination revealed draining sinuses in relation to noncarious 35 and 45 []. Both the teeth were tender to percussion and failed to respond to thermal and electrical pulp testing. Radiographic examination of both 35 and 45 revealed an Oehlers’ Type I DI, with incomplete root-end formation and a periapical radiolucent lesion. Incidentally, an Oehlers’ Type I DI was also noted in relation to 34 and 44 [Figures and ]. However, both 34 and 44 were nontender and showed a positive response to pulp testing. To obtain a detailed understanding of the root canal morphology and evaluate the type of invagination, a spiral computed tomography (CT) scan was done with a multi-detector CT scanner (16 slices/s), as per the recommendations given by Christoph et al.[] to reduce the radiation dosage (collimation: 1 mm; pitch: 2; tube voltage, 80 kV; tube current, 40 mA). Axial images were transmitted to a commercially available dental program (Denta scan, Advantage Windows; General Electric, Buc, France) to reformat panoramic and cross-sectional images in all three planes [Figures –].\nA clinical diagnosis of pulp necrosis and chronic periapical abscess in relation to 35 and 45 was made. Endodontic therapy was performed under rubber dam isolation. Access cavities were prepared, and the canal negotiated with small size files. The working lengths were established and recorded []. The canal was enlarged, and central hard tissue was removed using H-files and Gates Glidden drills with copious irrigation using 5.2% sodium hypochlorite. Calcium hydroxide dressing was given during the inter-appointment period for 2 weeks. Apical closure was done using mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), and the teeth were obturated by the thermoplasticized technique using Obtura II (Obtura Spartan Co., Fenton, MO, USA) with vertical compaction using finger pluggers. Then, both the teeth were restored with composite resin access restorations. There was no evidence of any pathology in relation to 34 and 44 and hence no treatment was needed for these teeth.\nPostoperative clinical and radiographic examination after 6 months showed satisfactory healing of the draining sinus and periapical lesion in relation to 35 and 45 [Figures –]."
"A 25-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of nonunion with severe residual deformity of the right hemipelvis. The initial diagnosis was vertical shear injury according to the Young-Burgess classification, and she underwent surgery at another hospital. When we saw her, she had severe buttock and pubic pain and moderate limping. Radiographs obtained at our hospital showed severe residual internal rotation deformity and 4-cm cranial displacement of the right hemipelvis. CT showed nonunion through the right iliac wing and the left pubic rami, along with upward migration, internal rotation, and adduction deformity. For surgery, the patient was placed in the supine position. The right posterior hemipelvis was osteotomized for mobilization through an iliac approach and then fixed with a plate and screws. With the patient still in the supine position, we used an ilioinguinal approach for the anterior pelvis, where we performed plating and placed a bone graft at the osteotomy site. Radiographs obtained immediately after surgery showed correction of the internal rotation and superior migration deformity. However, radiographs obtained at a follow-up examination 2 months later showed loss of reduction, metal failure, and nonunion, especially in the anterior pelvis. Therefore, we decided to operate again. The anterior lesion was reopened and fixed with a broad plate and fused at the symphysis. The posterior lesion was united and the plate was removed at the same time. A follow-up examination 6 years later showed a well-fused symphysis and posterior pelvis; the patient reported no bothersome symptoms ()."
"A 25-year-old male suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the face. The bullet had caused massive orbital, facial trauma, including a right frontal sinus fracture with near-complete opacification of the frontal sinus []. The fracture extended through both the anterior and posterior tables and was greater than the full width of the frontal sinus with radiographic evidence of NFOT obstruction. The patient had CSF rhinorrhea. Seven days after his presentation, he underwent a bifrontal craniotomy with cranialization of the frontal sinus and placement of a lumbar drain. Postoperative head CT [] showed successful cranialization of the frontal sinuses and residual pneumocephalus. The patient was evaluated 1.5 months after surgery and had no evidence of CSF leak. The follow-up head CT [] displayed postsurgical changes with significant resolution of the cerebral edema and mass effect."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of a high-grade fever with chills and rigors, extreme weakness, and reduced urine output for 3 days. On examination, he was febrile, dehydrated, icteric, no edema. Blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg, and pulse rate was 110/min. His blood sugar was 50 mg/dl, hemoglobin of 9 g/dl, platelet of 70,000 cells/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) - 6/14 mm, total count of 6000 cells/mm3, total bilirubin - 3.5 mg/dl, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase - 250 U/L, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase - 196 U/L, Amylase - 20U/L, serum creatinine was 3.0 mg/dl. Rapid card test for malaria was positive, so he was provisionally diagnosed as complicated malaria and admitted into Intensive Care Unit and started on intravenous fluids, intravenous artesunate. Peripheral smear examination revealed P. vivax species. His blood pressure (BP) dropped, and he was started on inotropes. Chloroquine was initiated to cover vivax infection, and artesunate was continued along with other supportive medications. His vitals improved over the next 48 h, and his renal function and liver function normalized in 3 weeks. He was discharged and given oral primaquine for 14 days to prevent a relapse of vivax infection."
"A 25-year-old man presented to our department with long-standing left-sided hearing loss. He underwent bilateral grommet insertion in childhood for recurrent otitis media complicated by a discharging left ear postoperatively. On grommet extrusion, he had a persistent left small central tympanic perforation with granulations, with subsequent unsuccessful fat graft myringoplasty at the age of 16. Conservative management witnessed spontaneous closure of the perforation, but with the development of a distorted appearance of the posterior tympanic membrane over the ensuing 7 years. He continued to have intermittent left otorrhoea throughout this period, but eventually achieved a dry ear with improvement of his pure tone audiogram threshold from a 40-dB conductive loss to 20 dB. He was discharged from otology at this point, but presented to our services 8 years later following deterioration in his left-sided hearing over the preceding year.\nOn assessment, he denied otorrhoea or other otological symptoms. His general medical history was unremarkable. His left tympanic membrane had a normal anterior appearance, but the posterior half of the external auditory canal was obliterated. His right ear was unremarkable, except for a patch of myringosclerosis. Audiometry revealed a right mild high tone sensorineural hearing loss (presumed secondary to previous otitis media) and a left severe mixed hearing loss (pure tone average 79 dB) associated with a type B tympanogram. CT imaging confirmed a normal middle ear cleft, with a plug of soft tissue containing dense calcification 8 mm lateral to the tympanic membrane (Fig. ), consistent with a diagnosis of left chronic fibrosing otitis externa.\nTo improve his hearing, he underwent a left external auditory canaloplasty. At operation, the skin overlying and immediately lateral to the posterior tympanic membrane was thickened and fibrosed, confirming the radiological findings. A 4-mm smooth bar of bone was found to be traversing the deep external auditory canal immediately lateral to the inferior tympanic membrane (Fig. ). The calibre of the external auditory canal was otherwise normal and symmetrical with that of the right ear. The bony bar was drilled away taking care not to damage the tympanic membrane. Upon peeling off the remaining mass of fibrosis, the underlying tympanic membrane was intact. A partial-thickness graft harvested from postauricular skin was used to cover the de-epithelialized tympanic membrane and exposed bone of the deep external auditory canal. Postoperative audiometry showed an improvement in conductive hearing with a pure tone average of 55 dB."
"A 25-year-old man with atopic dermatitis visited our Department because of food allergy and hand eczema. The patient had started working as a cook at the age of 18 years and handled various types of raw fish with his bare hands every day. After starting this work, severe itchy eczema appeared on his hands. He subsequently started to experience oral allergic symptoms, intraoral itchiness and dyspnea after eating fish. Total immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody level was 704 IU/ml and specific IgE antibody levels (CAP fluorescent enzyme immunoassay, Phadia Inc, Tokyo, Japan) were as follows: house dust, class 2 (1.99 UA/ml); house dust mites, class 2 (1.96 UA/ml); horse mackerel, class 3 (6.10 UA/ml); flounder, class 3 (5.97 UA/ml); salmon, class 3 (5.39 UA/ml); cod, class 3 (4.23 UA/ml); sardines, class 3 (4.16 UA/ml); mackerel, class 2 (2.35 UA/ml); tuna, class 2 (1.32 UA/ml), and Anisakis, class 3 (14.6 UA/ml). Skin prick tests (SPT) showed positive reactions to tuna, salmon, flounder, yellowtail, and Anisakis, but negative reactions to squid and deep-water shrimp. The positive control (1% of histamine dihydrochloride, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) exhibited a reaction of 5 × 4 mm. The negative control (physiological saline) exhibited no reaction.\nSample solutions (1 μg/ml) from each type of fish were immobilized onto a microplate to perform enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive reactions to multiple types of fish were observed in this assay (fig. ). Furthermore, the fluorescence intensities of specific IgE antibodies against parvalbumin from various types of fish in microarray immunoassay analysis (Immuno Solid-phase Allergen Chip, ISAC®; ThermoFisher, Uppsala, Sweden) showed positive reactions (table ) []."
"A 25-year old lady was brought to Dermatology OPD with a gradually increasing painless swelling over the upper-left arm of 8 month duration. The lesion appeared insidiously as an erythematous nodule which gradually increased in size to attain the present configuration. There was no preceding history of trauma. The patient was nondiabetic and no history suggestive of any major illness in the past especially history regarding immunosuppression could be elicited. On cutaneous examination, we revealed a well-defined, firm to hard, painless, nontender, indurated swelling of approximate 6.5 × 7.5 cm2 in size with surface ulceration and crusting at places []. Lesion was freely mobile over the underlying structures. The margin was well defined and indurated with positive finger insinuation test. Patient was afebrile and regional lymph nodes were not palpable. Rest of the general survey and systemic examinations were within normal limit.\nRoutine investigations including complete hemogram, renal, and liver function tests did not reveal any abnormality. She was seronegative for HIV by ELISA. X-ray of upper-left arm showed soft tissue shadow without any bony involvement. Biopsy sample was taken and sent for histopathology and culture. On direct microscopy with 10% potassium hydroxide mount, we found broad, irregular aseptate hyphae. Histopathology from skin lesion showed dense infiltrate of eosinophils, small cluster of epithelioid cells, foci of necrosis with few broad aseptate fungal hyphae surrounded by eosinophilic material (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon) [Figures and ]. Culture on Sabouraud's dextrose agar demonstrated luxurious, creamy white, membranous, centrally heaped up, radially folded colony with peripheral satellite growth. Bacteriological culture yielded no growth. Lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) test could not be performed due to lack of facility.\nAfter confirming the diagnosis as Basidiobolomycosis with the help of microscopy and culture, the patient was put on saturated solution of potassium iodide with strict vigilance of thyroid function and signs of iodism. The patient responded remarkably within 2 months. During the first follow up after 1month, lesion reduced to a great extent [] and on subsequent visit, it almost disappeared leaving some hyperpigmentation []."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented to outpatient department of tertiary care hospital with multiple painful elevated swellings of both left upper and lower extremities for last 15 years. Fifteen years back, he first noticed a small pea-shaped mildly painful swelling on the center of his chest. Subsequently the number of the lesions increased in number as well as in size and new lesions appeared on left foot, thigh, hand and forearm. These lesions initially were firm, but with progression of the disease some of the lesions became soft. No history of fever or systemic symptom was associated. No history of aggravation following trauma. No history of gastrointestinal bleeding or pathological fracture was present. With above complaints, the patient attended to local doctor and applied some ayurvedic medications over the lesions and developed some oozing and crusting and blister formation with serosangunous discharge from the dorsal aspect of the left foot. With this scenario he was referred to the OPD of a tertiary care hospital.\nExamination of the lesions revealed multiple nodules and tumors of 2–6 cm in size distributed over planter and dorsal aspect of left foot [], dorsal aspect of left hand and fingers [] and front and back of the left leg. Most of the lesions were oval to globular in shape, skin colored and with a well-defined margin. Some of the lesion showed crusting, oozing and post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentations.\nLesions were non-tender, soft to firm in consistency and partially compressible. Complete hemogram, sugar, urea, creatinine urine analyses were within the normal limits. However, liver function tests revealed elevation of transaminase level (SGOT-71, SGPT-114 and ALP-181). Chest X-ray was normal. X-ray of the hand and feet showed soft tissue swelling with calcification without any bony abnormality. We carried out color Doppler study of the patient which revealed dilated veins with phleboleiths.\nMost interestingly, histopathology of the patient revealed multiple vascular spaces; some were dilated and other were collapsed with slit-like openings. Some of the intravascular areas were showing intramural thrombi. The cellular elements of the tumor were mainly composed of multiple spindle-shaped cells with vesicular nucleus []. Based on clinical, radiological and histopathological findings, diagnosis of SCHE was made and the patient was referred to plastic surgeon and excision followed by full thickness skin grafting was done of the leg lesions. However, the result was unacceptable to the patient. The patient was lost to follow-up after discharge."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with Miller's Class I recession on 14 tooth region. Patient's chief complaint was receding gums. Patient's dental history reveals that he had undergone oral prophylaxis a year back. The recession defect was 3 mm depth exhibiting attachment loss.\nTreatment plan of envelope flap associated with PRF membrane was decided. Patient was informed about the therapeutic alternatives to the planned surgical procedure.\nThe required quantity of blood was drawn in 10 ml test tube without an anticoagulant. Blood was centrifuged immediately using table top centrifuge for 12 min at 2700 rpm.[]\nThree layers formed after centrifuging the blood:\nTop most layer consist of a cellular platelet-poor plasma PRF clot in the middle and Red blood cells at the bottom.\nBecause of the absence of anticoagulant, blood begins to clot as soon as it comes in contact with the glass surface. Therefore, for successful preparation of PRF speedy blood collection and immediate centrifugation before the clotting cascade initiates was absolutely essential. The PRF can be obtained in the form of membrane by squeezing out the fluids in the fibrin clot.[]\nThe recipient site was anesthetized by local infiltration []. Using a #15C blade, a sulcular incision was made around the tooth adjacent to the recession. A split – thickness envelope was created apical to the papilla and the adjacent radicular surface according to the procedure described by Raetzke [].[] The tissues were gently undermined, beyond the mucogingival junction (MGJ) so as to relax the flap sufficiently to allow placement of PRF. This envelope flap extended 5–10 mm apical to the recessed gingival margin and papilla and 4–6 mm mesial and distal to the denuded root surface. The prepared PRF membrane [] was pushed into the created envelop with a dull instrument (periosteal elevator). Once the graft was completely into the flap on the conditioned root surface, it was positioned coronal to the CEJ. Mild compression with sterile gauze dampened with saline was applied for 5 min. The membrane was secured with cyanoacrylate [] and periodontal pack (Coe pack) was placed []."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to the department with pain in his upper right posterior region since 1-week. On clinical examination, a mesioproximal caries lesion was detected on maxillary right first premolar (14), The premolar was tender on percussion. An intraoral periapical radiograph revealed mesioproximal radiolucency of the crown extending close to the pulp chamber of 14 []. Intraoral periapical (IOPA) X-ray also revealed a complex radicular anatomy with two buccal roots and a separate palatal root for 14. Electric pulp testing also was done, and 14 exhibited a delayed response. Maxillary right first premolar (14) was diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis and after discussing with patient root canal treatment of 14 was initiated.\nAfter rubber dam isolation of 14, access opening was done under local anesthesia (2% lignocaine with 1:80,000 Adrenaline, Lignox, Indoco remedies Ltd., India). Expecting two buccal canals, the access opening was made mesiodistally wider than normal on the buccal aspect making the access opening T-shaped. The palatal canal was first located, and dentinal map on the floor of the pulp chamber was traced to locate two separate buccal canals. Working length was determined with electronic apex locator (i-pex, NSK, Nakanishi, Japan) and was confirmed with IOPA X-ray []. The three canals were cleaned and shaped using k files till size 15. After this canals were instrumented sequentially with ProTaper rotary files (Dentsply Tulsa Dental) till size F2. While instrumenting canals were lubricated with Glyde (Dentsply Malliefer, Switzerland) and irrigated with 3% sodium hypochlorite (Prime Dental products, India) and 0.9% normal saline (Baxter, India). The root canals were dried with paper points, obturated using Gutta-percha with resin based sealer (AH Plus, Dentsply, Detrey, Konstanz, Germany) and the postobturation radiograph is shown in . The access cavity was then sealed with IRM (Dentsply Caulk, Milford, USA) and restored with composite after 7 days. The patient was referred to the Department of Prosthodontics for full coverage restoration."
"A 25-year-old female patient who earlier had implant placement in relation to 46 and 47 reported to our department for second stage surgery. This patient was planned for papilla regeneration technique described by Palacci et al.[] This technique was reported by Palacci et al. 1992 and Andresean et al. 1994,[] in which the attached mucosa at the top of the ridge is moved in a buccal direction at second stage surgery to obtain a papilla like formation and increased bulk of tissue around implants."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with 1-year history of occipital headache. The headache was increasing with coughing, sneezing and bending over. She had also complaints of intermittent bilateral hand numbness and bilateral feet burning. She was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed Chiari I malformation with a 7 mm descent of cerebellar tonsils (Fig. a and b). Computed tomography demonstrated diffuse calvarial thickening and loss of the medullary space (Fig. ). Her past medical history was consistent with left eye surgery due to amblyopia when she was a child and she was blind in her left eye. Radioactive 131I treatment had been given due to the Graves’ disease and hyperthyroidism; therefore, she was hypothyroidic and was using levothyroxine daily. Her mother also was operated on because of the Chiari malformation. She had four siblings, and they did not have any pertinent medical history. Her physical examination revealed prominent occipital area and midfacial hypoplasia. Increased cortical thickness in her long bones was also demonstrated (Fig. a–c). There were no abnormal findings on neurological examination except of left eye amorozis. The patient underwent surgery for decompression of posterior fossa. Large enough posterior fossa craniectomy with C1 laminectomy was performed with SSEP and MEP monitoring. Dura was opened in ‘Y’ shape, and duraplasty was performed with the pericranium. Arachnoid was kept intact. Her headaches improved significantly in postoperative period. She developed superficial wound infection, which was treated with simple washout and antibiotics."
"We present the case of a 25-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of intermittent asthma who presented to the emergency room with acute onset of headache, nausea and vomiting. He had recently sustained mild trauma to his head, but denied loss of consciousness. He endorsed no known personal or family history of hypertension. Vital signs on presentation were temperature 36.7°C, blood pressure 190/130 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 114 to 165 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 26–32 breaths per minute, with 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Chest radiograph revealed severe pulmonary edema with normal-sized heart. CT head revealed small right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. While in the emergency room, the patient developed sudden onset substernal chest pain, tachycardia and dyspnea resulting in respiratory failure requiring intubation and ICU admission. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with ST depression in the lateral leads (Fig. ). Cardiac enzymes were elevated with troponin I levels peaking at 213.6 µ/l (normal <0.09 µ/l). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed diffuse hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 12% (Fig. and ). The patient continued to deteriorate, developed hypotension refractory to vasopressors and ultimately passed away from multiorgan failure.\nPlasma-free normetanephrine and metanephrine levels drawn prior to initiation of vasopressors were found to be unmeasurably high (both >20 000 pg/ml). Autopsy report revealed right and left adrenal masses measuring 25 and 100 mm in maximum diameter, respectively (Fig. ), consistent with pheochromocytoma. An old death certificate was subsequently found at the patient's family home, which revealed that his mother had died of circulatory collapse at our medical center secondary to pheochromocytoma while giving birth to the patient, who himself lost his life from the same disease, in the same hospital, 25 years later. It was ultimately revealed that some estranged maternal relatives had known MEN 2A syndrome. However, the patient and his immediate family were all unaware of these diagnoses."
"A 25-year-old pregnant female (G2P2L1) with full-term pregnancy was referred for elective cesarean section due to polyhydramnios. The patient had a 3-year-old normal boy from her previous pregnancy. Unfortunately prenatal sonography only described polyhydramnios. Cesarean section was performed and a female newborn was delivered. The baby weighed 3250 g. Extreme retroflexion of the head and left club foot were seen. Mild respiratory distress was noted. Cervicothoracic X-ray revealed cervical hyperextension ( - ).\nBrain and thorax CT scan without contrast with coronal, sagittal and 3-dimensional reformatted images of the vertebra and chest wall were obtained. Images revealed absence of the posterior portion of the corpus callosum and prominent cerebellar cistern. Cerebellar vermis is not appreciated in the brain CT scan raising the possibility for agenesis. No brain MRI for correlation was available (). Indeed, multiple bony abnormalities are visualized, composed of occipital bone defect around the foramen magnum causing a 2.5 cm widening of the foramen ( and ), hyperextended cervical spines ( and ) as well as unfused posterior elements of cervical and thoracic spines (arrows in and ), hemivertebra at T1 ( and ), hypoplasia of the mandible, hypotelorism, posterior fusion of T10-T11-T12 and C5-C6-C7 (3D-images in ), bifid ribs with posterior fusion (ribs 3 and 4, and 7 and 8) and anterior fusion (ribs 5 and 6) were seen ( and ).\nTransthoracic echocardiogram was done and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (apical), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) were detected. Abdominopelvic sonography revealed small-sized kidneys for gestational age on both sides (right side was 35 × 17 mm and left side was 33 × 16 mm). Other abdominal organs were normal."
"A healthy 25-year-old smoking male presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The patient complained of a tender, small swelling, and white creamy discharge in the right sublingual area.\nThe presence of a giant salivary calculus of the Wharton duct was confirmed by intraoral radiography and CT scan that showed two radiopaque oval formations, one about 50 mm in length and 5 mm in width on the right side and the other 30 mm in length and 5 mm in width on the left side [].\nUnder intravenous sedation and local anesthesia, the sialolith was removed through an incision parallel to the submandibular gland duct. The incision was sutured, and antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin 500 mg and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) analgesics were administrated. The patient was discharged from the hospital 2 days after the operation. Two weeks after the operation, the patient was recalled and examined. The operation site exhibited normal healing process, and secretion of saliva was observed."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a left shoulder pain that had persisted for 2 months. She had no incidence of trauma or prior medical history. Due to deteriorating pain, she visited a nearby hospital and was diagnosed with bone tumor of the clavicle on radiography. She then was referred to our institute for further treatment. On initial physical examination, the overlying skin was smooth with slight redness. There was hotness with tenderness upon pressure in the area. The range of motion of the left shoulder was limited due to pain. On the plain radiograph, there was a 2-cm osteolytic lesion in the middle third of clavicle with slight periosteal reaction (fig. ). On MRI, the lesion was depicted as low intensity on T1-WI and high on T2-WI, with the extra-skeletal mass extending to the coracoid process (fig. ). On positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, the lesion was solitary with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 14.23 (fig. ). The blood examination results were all in the normal range. Differential diagnosis included malignant lesions such as Ewing sarcoma and plasmacytoma; therefore, open biopsy was performed. On histopathologic examination, the lesion was composed of histiocytic appearing cells with prominent eosinophils. On immunohistochemistry, the lesion was positive for CD1a and S-100, confirming the diagnosis of LCH (fig. ). One year after biopsy, the lesion is well healed with no local recurrence or distant metastasis."
"A 25-year-old male labourer presented to emergency department with colicky pain in the abdomen and nausea of 2 weeks duration. He denied any history of fever. His bowel habits were normal. On examination, mild icterus was noted. Mild tenderness was elicited in the right hypochondrium on abdominal examination. Liver was not enlarged. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin of 2.9 mg/dl (normal range 0.3–1.9 mg/dl); direct fraction elevated (2.1 mg/dl). Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were mildly elevated, 132 and 140 U/l, respectively (normal range 0–30 U/l). Alkaline phosphatase was found to be markedly elevated, 1272 U/l (normal range 20–140 U/l).\nHe was taken up for USG of the abdomen which showed bilobar dilated intra hepatic biliary radicals. A linear echogenic shadow was seen in the common bile duct (CBD). Subsequently, magnetic resonance cholangiography was ordered which revealed a non-shadowing hypointense tube-like structure in the CBD (Fig. ) [, ]. A side-viewing endoscopy was performed which showed a long roundworm moving in the duodenum with one end inside the CBD. Worm was taken out with snare (Fig. ). His icterus resolved and liver enzymes normalized in next 4 days. Antihelminthic therapy was given."
A 25-year-old lady with large congenital nevus of face [] attended hospital with the chief complaint of ugly look of face due to nevus. The patient was thoroughly examined and found to be fit otherwise. We planned a multi-stage excision of the nevus and reconstruction of the facial tissue with local tissue advancement flap by stretching of the tissues. The patient agreed to our plan and we started with excision of nasal tissues and reconstruction planned by median forehead flap []. Major part of nose and tip was reconstructed by the standard technique. The healing was uneventful. The patient is happy with initial cosmetic result [].
"A 25-year old illiterate female patient presented at the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) department of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science (IGIMS), Patna with a complaint of gradually progressive ulcerative lesion on the infra-alar region of the right side of the face over the last 2 months. She had consulted with a local doctor and received 9 months of antitubercular treatment as advised by him/her. The lesion was increasing in size, so she came to IGIMS for a second opinion. On examination, an ulcerative lesion was noted on the upper lip region toward the right side just below the nasal area, 4.5 × 3 cm2 and edematous margins, with yellowish dry slough on the base of the ulcer. The periculer edema was noted to include the right ala of the nose and right side of the cheek, extending up to the infraorbital region and also involving the lower lid. There was induration in the base region. The nasal cavity and palate were normal. There was no other lesion or lump seen on ENT examination. No other lymph node was palpable in any other part of the body. The chest x-ray, ultrasonography (USG) abdomen, and routine blood investigation were normal.\nThe biopsy was performed by an ENT surgeon and the tissue was sent for histopathological examination. Microscopic examination showed the features of T-cell lymphoma, and the use of immunohistochemical (IHC) markers was advised. After IHC analysis, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen or LCA) was positive (3+) [] and CD3 was positive (1+) []; the impression was of NHL T-cell immunophenotype on examination. Although NK marker studies could not be done, the biological behavior of NK-positive and T-positive nasal extranodal lymphomas is similar, hence they are collectively termed NK/T-cell lymphomas. Thus, based on the clinical picture, histopathology and IHC were used toward the diagnosis of ENKL.\nAfter the histopathology and IHC marker reports, the patient was sent to the oncology department for further treatment. At our department, she received chemotherapy in the form of CHOP regimen [cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, hydroxydaunorubicin or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, Oncovin (vincristine) 1.4 mg/m2, and prednisone 40 mg/m2] D1-D5, with all premedication cycles to be reported every 21-days regimen. She received six cycles of chemotherapy. She responded well to the chemotherapy and the ulcer has been healed completely, without any major side effects but with residual dry scar tissue."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to our dental operatory with the complaint of large, unsightly, and unpleasant central incisor. History revealed an episode of traumatic injury at the age of 13-14 years, subsequent to which the patient visually observed the anomalous change of maxillary central incisor fused to lateral incisor.\nClinical examination of the tooth in question revealed a maxillary central incisor fused to lateral incisor (). On the buccal and palatal aspects, deep grooves separating both crowns extended into the gingival sulcus (). An initial radiograph indicated that the teeth were joined coronally and extending toward the cervical area (). Radiographic evaluation with a change in horizontal angulation seemed to point toward the same. The endodontic evaluation confirmed the positive vitality of both the teeth with suspected pulpal communication.\nA provisional diagnosis of “transposition with a fusion of the maxillary left lateral incisor with the central incisor with two separate root canal systems” was given. A diagnostic dental stone model was prepared to simulate the planned surgical and restorative corrections (). Pulpal involvement was anticipated and, therefore, endodontic therapy was also contemplated.\nPeriodontal surgery was performed, as step two and a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated (). It was observed on surgical exposure, that the degree of fusion was extensive than anticipated. With a dentinal bridge extending 2-3 mm beyond the cervical region. The same was sectioned using the high-speed rotary instrument to achieve root separation. This was followed up with odontoplasty, restoration of the area of communication, alveoloplasty (to maintain the biologic width) and re-establishment of the gingival zeniths along with creation of the new papillary contours befitting the newly created tooth anatomy. The flap was sutured using 4-0 non-resorbable sutures, and the periodontal pack was placed. Post-surgical care and instructions were explained to the patient.\nA radiographic re-evaluation of the site, after 1 week confirmed the surgical separation. Tooth preparation and final restoration with porcelain fused to the metal crown was done at the end of 1-month post surgically (). Subsequent 6 months and 12 months ( and ) follow-up indicated uneventful healing with satisfactory esthetics."
"In July 2010 a 25 year-old man was admitted with 2-month history of intermittent colicky\nabdominal pain and bilious vomiting and abdominal distension. He also complained from\nchronic constipation, anorexia and 14 kg weight loss during the previous two months. He\nhad no surgical or other medical history except using of a body building supplement\ndrugs which contain creatin.\nOn physical examination he was anxious. Vital signs were normal (blood pressure 110/75,\npulse rate 85/min, temperature 37.3º C). Abdominal distention with hyperactive\nbowel sounds and mild tenderness in the whole of the abdomen especially in left upper\nquadrant were detected at physical examination. There were no abdominal scars, palpable\nabdominal mass or organomegaly. Digital rectal examination was normal. Laboratory blood\nanalysis ascertained a total leukocyte count 8500 cell/ml, hemoglobin 16 mg/dl, normal\nserum chemistry and normal urine analysis. Up right plain abdominal X-ray showed\nmultiple air-fluid levels without free gas under the diaphragm. The barium X-ray showed\njejunal and ileal loops dilatation with the contrast medium passing slowly (). Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed\ntomography showed small bowel loops and dilatation ().\nDue to signs of mechanical small bowel obstruction an emergency laparotomy was performed\nthrough a midline incision. During surgery the small bowel dilatation was observed; its\nmesentery was edematous and the whole small bowel covered by a dense whitish membrane\nwhich gave the appearance of a cocoon ().\nCareful sharp and blunt dissection with excision of the membrane enveloping the small\nbowel was performed and the whole small intestine was freed and followed from\nduodenojejunal angle to ileocecal junction. The histopathology of the peeled off\nmembrane revealed a chronic non-specific inflammatory reaction with proliferation of\nfibroconnective tissue.\nThe patient was discharged from the hospital on the 8th postoperative day.\nAfter 24 months regular follow-up he was in satisfactory condition and the abdominal\nplain showed normal appearance."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a painless and mobile lump in breast measuring 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm. Aspiration cytology of the lump revealed moderately cellular smears comprising of few branching fragments of benign ductal epithelial cells intimately mixed with spherical acellular homogenous hyaline globules [Figure and ]. A few dispersed bare, bipolar cells were also seen in the background. A cytological diagnosis of CS associated with benign proliferative breast disease was given.\nA 59-year-old female presented with a lump in the upper-outer quadrant of left breast measuring 5 cm × 5 cm. The magnetic resonance imaging revealed a heterogeneous noninfiltrating lesion in the left breast. The axilla was clear. The fine-needle aspiration cytology from the left breast lump revealed cellular smears composed of epithelial cells and acellular basement material. The epithelial cells were small and basaloid forming cohesive, spherical, and tri-dimensional structures with a central core of acellular homogenous basement membrane substance [Figure and ]. A cytological diagnosis of ACCB was given. The patient underwent left mastectomy. Mastectomy specimen revealed a 4.5 cm × 4.5 cm × 3.5 cm lesion in the upper-outer quadrant of the left breast. Microscopic examination revealed tumor cells arranged in solid nests, proliferating glands, and cylideromatous differentiation containing eosinophilic basement membrane-like material and basophilic secretions. The areas of cribriform pattern were also seen in the desmoplastic stroma. All resection margins, nipple, and areola, were free from tumor invasion. The histopathology confirmed the cytological diagnosis of ACCB."
"A 25-year-old young female reported to our department with complaint of appearance of painless lump intraorally in the left posterior region of lower jaw after extraction of left second molar, a month back in a private clinic. On examination, no extraoral swelling was present. Intraorally, a small exuberant growth protruding from the extraction socket of lower left second molar was seen, surrounding area was covered by normal appearing mucosa. A panoramic radiograph revealed the presence of a well demarcated, multilocular radiolucent lesion extending from first molar to third molar on the left side. A biopsy of the lesion was performed which revealed OM []. Aggressive curettage with extraction of 36 and 38 followed by peripheral ostectomy was done intraorally under local anaesthesia (LA), keeping in view the young age of female and literature showing less recurrence in mandible []. Histopathological examination showed unencapsulated tumor mass showing spindle- and stellate-shaped cells in loose connective tissue stroma. Odontogenic epithelial rests were not observed and are not essential for diagnosis []. The healing was uneventful with good amount of bone formation seen radiographically. The patient has been followed up for 7 years with no recurrence."
"A 25-year-old male belonging to the low socioeconomic strata presented with a painful, soft tissue swelling on the scalp of 3 months duration. The swelling had gradually increased in size with mild pain. The pain was dull and localized to the lesion. There was no history of trauma. The patient had a history of rise of temperature in the evening, weakness, decreased appetite, headache, and giddiness for the last 1 month. The patient had a past history of cervical tubercular lymphadenitis 2 years ago, which was treated by antitubercular therapy for a period of 9 months. For the current problem, the patient had received a short course of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs but there was no improvement. The patient was known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 positive and had been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the last 3 years.\nOn local examination, there was single, nonpulsatile, cystic, nontender scalp swelling measuring 3 × 3 cm over the posterior-superior part of the skull. The skin over the swelling was essentially normal without any signs of acute or chronic inflammation. There were no sinuses or induration. Cough impulse was also absent. Clinically differential diagnoses of sebaceous cyst or lipoma or adenexal tumors of the skin were considered.\nSystemic examination revealed multiple bilateral cervical lymph nodes of sizes ranging from 2 × 2 cm to 1 × 1 cm. Healed puckered sinuses were seen on the right side in the neck.\nRoutine haematological examinations including total leukocyte counts and differential leukocyte counts were within normal limits. However, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was raised, which was 40 mm in the first hour (Westergren's method). At the time of presentation, the CD4 count was within normal limits."
"A 25-year-old male presented with left cervical lymphadenopathy since 1 month. The patient was diagnosed as HIV seropositive 6 months earlier and was on treatment. He was clinically asymptomatic. Routine laboratory investigations were performed, which showed hemoglobin of 8 g%, a total leukocyte count of 6,000/mm3, with a differential count of neutrophils 65%, lymphocytes 33%, and monocytes and eosinophils 1% each. The CD4 counts were 47 per milliliter. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 80 mm in 1 h. Chest radiograph was normal. Fine-needle aspiration was performed from enlarged left side cervical node. The aspirate was necrotic. Smears were prepared and stained with Giemsa and hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stains.\nThe aspirate smear showed macrophages containing intracellular spherical to ovoid bodies each surrounded by a small light halo. Some of the macrophages were ruptured and yeast-like organisms released outside were also seen []. So, a diagnosis suggestive of histoplasmosis was made and the remaining material was sent for culture for confirmation. Culture was done in Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25° C; after 2 weeks, it showed colony of the mold which was white-brown with a cottony appearance. Lactophenol cotton blue stain of the isolated mold was done and viewed under microscopy. It showed a knobby appearance of thick-walled and tuberculate macroconidia and microconidia with long septate hyphae. Hence, the diagnosis of histoplasmosis of lymph node was confirmed."
"The doping case regarded the result of urine sample analysis of a 25-year-old male Futsal Premier League player in season 2014 - 2015, Iran. He had no history of anti-doping rules violation. He was selected randomly for sampling during a match, mid-2014. His sample was positive for morphine, and was alleged to violation of article 6 of FIFA anti-doping regulations. FIFA anti- doping regulations refer to the WADA prohibited list to define prohibited drugs. The player denied using narcotics including morphine in testimony but admitted that he had taken a number of acetaminophen-codeine tablets ( 300 mg and 10 mg, respectively), the day before match for controlling tooth pain. He did not remember the exact number or the exact time of ingesting the tablets. The reported concentrations of morphine and codeine is his urine sample were 54.5 µg/ml and 52.7 µg/ml respectively. Mor/Cod ratio was 1.03 in this case, this Mor/Cod ratio was in agreement of Mor/Cod ratio reported by He et al. () 24 hours after codeine consumption. Considering the fact that codeine is not among the WADA 2015 prohibited list, the positive result for morphine in urine sample was attributed to codeine consumption.\nHe presented no significant past medical history, specifically hepatic disease. The football player denied taking any drugs or substances but the acetaminophen-codeine tablets in the 2 months before testing.\nThe disciplinary committee came to the conclusion that the player had not violated anti-doping rules. The player could establish how the prohibited substance entered his system and had no intention for enhancing performance. Therefore, according to article 21 of FIFA anti-doping regulations the doping case was dismissed."
"A 25-year-old single female with a temperamental history of mood swings and low frustration tolerance was on treatment for emotionally unstable personality disorder-impulsive sub-type. She had a past history of two impulsive self-harm attempts of low intentionality and lethality. Oxcarbazepine 300 mg once daily was started for her marked and unpredictable mood fluctuations. Currently, she presented with a depressive episode of 2 months duration characterized by low mood, lack of interest, ideas of hopelessness, and anhedonia. Her physical examination findings were within normal limits. She did not have significant preexisting medical or neurological illnesses. Her metabolic profile, liver, and renal function tests were within normal limits. Sertraline 50 mg once daily was started while continuing oxcarbazepine 300 mg/day. Within 2 days of starting treatment, she began to experience frequent episodes of sustained involuntary opening of jaw lasting for about 2–3 min each time suggestive of mandibular dystonia. These episodes would recur multiple times daily and were extremely distressing in nature. Tablet sertraline was stopped quickly while continuing oxcarbazepine. This was followed by immediate and complete resolution of dystonia. The Naranjo probability score of 6 suggested a relationship between sertraline use and this adverse event.[] Subsequently, the patient was started on mirtazapine 15 mg/day and there was no recurrence of dystonia. The depressive symptoms became better and she improved significantly over 1-month."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with low back pain for 2 years treated with a number of selective L4/L5 transforaminal steroid injections and physical therapy with good relief. She had sudden exacerbation of pain in the left buttock and leg for a month, which was refractory to conservative management. Neurological examination revealed presence of left sided extensor hallucis longus weakness (4/5) with numbness involving left L5 dermatome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a left L4/L5 disc herniation []. Due to severe unrelenting pain, minimally invasive left L4/L5 microdiscectomy was performed. After performance of the left sided laminotomy with resection of the ligamentum flavum and identification of the dura, a disc fragment was seen extruding through what was considered an annulus defect [, left]. However, on further cephalad exposure with delineation of the anatomy, what was initially considered to be the annulus turned out to be the nerve root and the disc was seen herniating through a split in the left L5 nerve root essentially transecting the nerve root longitudinally [, right]. There was no obvious cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). All herniated disc fragments were removed, and it was ensured that the nerve was free at the end of the procedure []. No attempted to repair any dura was made as there was no CSF leak. The patient improved right after surgery and there was no recurrence of symptoms at 1 year followup."
"A 25-years-old man presented to us with 6 months history of right hip pain of insidious onset. Pain was initially mild but gradually increased in severity over few months and worse on movements. Medical treatment with non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgesics did not relief his pains.\nThe patient had moderate to severe pain, antalgic gait and restriction internal and external rotation the hip, due to pain. Initial standard pelvis and lumbosacral spine radiographs were normal.\nMRI showed marked bone edema of the superomedial portion of the acetabulum and our experience with that appearance on MRI strongly suggested osteoid osteoma [], CT scan confirmed the possible diagnosis showing a small sclerotic lesion in the acetabulum near the fovea measuring 4 mm.\nBeing close to the articular cartilage we decided that arthroscopy would be the operative technique of choice to excise this lesion to avoid the possible complications reported with surgical dislocation of the hip joint and to allow for early mobilization and immediate weight bearing.\nStandard hip arthroscopy was taken out using the traction table. We started with the proximal anterolateral portal using the same anatomic surface landmarks used for intra-articular injection of the hip joint to start in the peripheral compartment without the use of image intensifier []. No abnormalities were detected in femoral head or labrum, and mild synovitis was noticed. The distal anterolateral portal was created from outside - In under vision, motorized shaver introduced and partial synovectomy done. Distraction of the hip joint was done to gain access into the central compartment, and a small cartilage defect close to the fovea with the lesion underneath was noticed. Excision of the nidus was done using a small open curette. Being small and close to fovea nothing was done for the cartilage defect.\nHistological examination of the excised tissue confirmed the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma. After the operation, the patient’s pain completely resolved. He remained symptom-free at 4 months of follow-up. He underwent physiotherapy to improve the range of motion of the hip. Harris hip score improved from 12.4 to 99."
"It is a case report of a 25 years old male presented to us in outpatient departments with chief complaint of discharging wounds over mid part of his left arm since six months. On the complete history taking he revealed that he had an episode of trauma one year back over his left arm due to fall on the ground and swelling develops at that time. For it he did not take any medical advice and he took few pain killers and repeated massage over his left arm. Subsequently he noticed that the swelling over his whole left arm is permanent. After six months of this incident he felt that now mid of his arm is pain full and after 2 to 3 episodes of fever pus discharge came out. Since then, on and off the pus (sometimes with chunk of bone) is coming out.\nOn physical examination there were multiple discharging sinuses (with the protruding bony chunk) over his lateral aspect of his mid part of the left arm with puckered and hyper pigmented skin []. On palpation his left arm was thickened and tenderness was found around the arm. Range of movements over left shoulder and elbow were terminally restricted and pain full. Vital signs of patient were stable and distal neurovascular status was intact. Clinical provisional diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis of left humerus made and his hematological examination and X-ray sought. His hematological study was near normal except the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) which was raised (Westergren’s method=35 mm/hour).\nX- Ray was astonishing, entire humerus bone was normal, and there was no any osteomyelitic change in the humerus. There was a geographic appearance of myositis ossificans around the upper two third of left arm [].\nAfter consent taking, the patient got operated. Sinuses curetted out and sequestrum (infected part of myositis mass, because it was not feasible to remove the all myositis mass) removed and sent for biopsy and culture sensitivity. Now after the one year of follow-up, there is no recurrence of the myositis ossificans. And the patient is free from discharging sinuses and has resumed his work."
"A 25 year old male patient presented in the emergency department with history of road traffic accident. There was complaint of injury to left hip and leg associated with pain and swelling. There was no history of injury elsewhere. On examination, the patient was conscious, oriented. Vital parameters were normal. There was swelling over the left leg.\nAbrasions were present at the anterior aspect of proximal and middle thirds of leg. Tenderness was present over tibial shaft. There was swelling and tenderness over the left hip. There was no particular deformity and no distal neurovascular deficit. Radiograph of the hip revealed fracture of the greater trochanter, fracture of neck of femur, incongruency of hip and fracture of acetabulum [. Radiograph of leg revealed fracture of shaft of tibia. Computerized tomography of hip revealed fracture of the posterior wall of acetabulum, fracture of femoral head with intraarticular fragments, posterior dislocation of the hip, fracture of the femoral neck and fracture separating the greater trochanter and lateral part proximal femur from rest of femur [.\nUrgent open reduction and fixation was done through a posterior approach extending on the lateral aspect of thigh []. The proximal femur fractures were fixed with dynamic hip screw and multiple cancellous screws. Fracture of the posterior acetabular wall was reduced, grafted and fixed with reconstruction plate. Short leg plaster cast with incorporating upper tibial skeletal pin was applied for fracture of the shaft of tibia because it was undisplaced and with minimal swelling. Postoperatively the patient was kept on longitudinal traction through upper tibial skeletal pin for 6 weeks after which mobilization was initiated. Patient was on regular follow up for 3 years. At last visit patient was walking painless without a limp. Radiograph at 3 years showed good fracture healing without any sign of osteonecrosis of femoral head or heterotrophic ossification []."
"A 25 Years old male presented to orthopaedic causality with injury to right ankle following a road traffic accident. Patient complained of severe pain and deformity of ankle following injury. On examination ankle was deformed and swollen with very tense skin. Abrasion was present on the medial aspect [, ]. Foot was in equinus and supination with no distal neurovascular deficits. Plain radiographs revealed total anterolateral I dislocation of talus without accompanying ankle fracture [, ], CT scan with 3D reconstruction also confirmed our radiographic findings []. Under spinal anaesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance, closed reduction was performed by longitudinal traction and pushing the talus in the posteromedial direction. Following this technique talus was reduced and click was felt. Reduction was confirmed by fluoroscopy images and were acceptable. To maintain reduction a 3mm K-wire was passed from calcaneum to tibia through talus [, ]. A posterior below knee splint was applied. Splint was removed after six weeks and mobilised. Patient was followed every three months till one year. At one year follow up patient had good range of motion at ankle and subtalar joint. Plain radiographs at one year follow up showed no signs of avascular necrosis of talus or arthritis of subtalar joint."
"A case of young male patients aged 25 years old presented with history injured from falling heavy object on his back. At initial evaluation, he had severe pain on his back with deformity of the vertebrae. He felt numbness and had weakness on this both legs. The physical examination revealed contusion on his back Neurological examination confirmed complete paralysis of L5 and S1 root on both sides. Loss Bladder-bowel function, sphincter tone and perianal sensation.\nRadiographic findings Plain radiograph of lumbosacral spine showed the anterior dislocation of L5-S1 spondylolisthesis approximately 75%, () with the complete comminuted burst fracture of L5 vertebra () Computed tomography revealed a fracture of right lamina and both pedicle of L5. There was retropulsion of communited fragments inside spinal canal causing sever caudal compression.\nThe patient underwent surgery on emergency basis 6hrs after initial injury. In prone position, standard midline posterior subperiosteal dissection was carried out above & below injured vertebral body. Transpedicular screws were placed into L4 and S1 bilaterally. Because of neurological involvement laminectomy & unilateral facectomy was carried out to decompress thecal sac and roots of L5 and S1. Restoration of the affected vertebral body done by distracting L4 and S1 over screws. Complete discetomy of L4/5 and L5/S1 were undertaken. Conservative Corpectomy to decompress thecal sac and accommodate expandable cage was then performed using large curates, kerisons rongerd and pitutary forcepes while the dura and roots were protected. Hollow of expandable cage filled with cancellous bony chips inserted from left side to achieve fusion. Rest of the defect also filled with bony cancellous chips harvested from local laminectomy. Pedicular screws are connected with rod and singal cross connector. The procedure lasted for 4hr, the blood loss was 1200mls. () demonstrate serial images during surgery of pedicle location, screw placement & cage insertion in to achieve vertebral hight. No complication was observed afterward during the admission. Motor power in his lower 2 extremities was still similar to that found initially as well as his sensation. From the (), it shows the new alignment of the spine, however, 25% dislocation of the spines would be observed. On the day fifth after the operation, his pain was relieved. The lumbosacral brace was used and wheelchair ambulation was encouraged. He was discharge on the eighth day after the operation."
"A 25-year-old male was brought to the emergency department with an alleged history of fipronil compound consumption following which he developed three episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and altered sensorium. There was no other significant history and no past history of head trauma, stroke or seizure disorder. Patient on examination had a normal pulse, blood pressure, and O2 saturation. Pupils were bilaterally pinpoint. Central nervous examination revealed that apart from altered sensorium patient had coarse tremors, incoordination. Per-abdomen examination revealed the retention of urine. Computer tomography of the brain was normal [], routine blood investigations such as hemogram, renal function tests, liver function tests, and electrolytes were also normal. The patient was given with 4 mg of lorazepam on arrival to the hospital. The patient had two more episodes of seizures even after two repeated doses of lorazepam. Injection midazolam 1 cc given as stat dose and repeated every 4 h following which seizures did not occur. The patient regained consciousness after 10 h and was responding to oral commands. However, the patient remained delirious for 3 successive days. On additional antipyschotics along with benzodiazepines patient gradually improved within a week and got discharged on 8th day."
"This case of P.V.N.S is reported for its rarity of incidence and a good result obtained with minimal open intervention.\nA 25 yr old male presented with chronic painless swelling of left knee joint of three month duration, to our orthopedic department. He did not report any history of injury. There was no locking and giving away sensation. Clinically effusion and synovial thickening was noted. Skin was stretched but without any signs of inflammation. No dilated veins. No ligament laxity was observed. Plain radiograph was not showing any changes. M.R.I of knee joint showed effusion, low signal intensity on both T1 and T1 weighed images with diagnosis of hyperplastic synovium. These findings were suggestive of pigmented villonodular synovitis. Arthroscopy was done under spinal anaesthesia. Dark red colored fluid drained from the joint with introduction of arthroscopy canula. Synovium was hypertrophic with villi formation with characteristic orange color. Widespread affection of synovium noted. Cruciate ligaments were covered with Synovium but were intact. Femoral and tibial articular surfaces were normal. Arthroscopic synovectomy was done using four anterior and two posterior portals to ensure maximum removal of affected synovium. Supra patellar pouch was having maximum amount of hypertrophic Synovium. Haemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. Sterile compression dressing was applied to prevent haemarthrosis. The synovial tissue was sent for histopathological examination. Suture removal was done on day 12. Range motion exercises were started as pain decreased.\nHistopathological examination showed a mononuclear stromal cell infiltrate in the synovial membrane. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages were observed giving the characteristic brown color. Additional cell populations included foam cells and multinucleated giant cells. These findings were consistent with diagnosis of PVNS. The patient returned to his job after 4 months. No recurrence was seen at the end of two years. The radiographs taken at 2 years showed no signs of degenerative changes."
"A 25-year-old female smoker (with a smoking history of 5 pack-years) presented to our institution. She was unofficially employed as a clerk in a bakery. She reported social drinking but no illicit drug use. Her salary was R$ 725.00 (US$ 327.00). She had previously been treated for tuberculosis but had not adhered to the prescribed treatment regimens. According to the patient, this was due to the fact that she was granted no social security benefit allowances for tuberculosis and had to work during the treatment period. She lived in a three-bedroom household with three other people (a 5-year-old daughter, a brother, and her mother) and slept alone in one of the bedrooms. She had received home oxygen therapy in the period between December of 2013 and her admission to HNGR. She was hospitalized on February 10, 2014. Treatment for XDR-TB was initiated on March 10, 2014."
"A 25-year-old Indian woman with a past medical history of childhood asthma and migraine headaches was admitted to the General Surgical Service for a painful swelling over her sacral region of one week's duration. This was associated with fever, chills and rigors. Physical examination revealed a hirsute lady, with a 4-cm by 8-cm lump with erythematous skin changes overlying the sacrococcygeal region with a discharging sinus in the midline 6 cm from the anal verge. Investigations revealed leukocytosis of 14.9×109/L with a raised C-reactive protein of 104.0 mg/L. A clinical diagnosis of pilonidal abscess was made, and the patient was started on intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate and underwent an incision and drainage of the pilonidal abscess under general anesthesia.\nIntraoperative findings revealed a 5-cm by 6-cm pilonidal abscess with a communicating inferior pit of 3 cm from the main abscess cavity. The abscess did not breach the sacral fascia, and there was no communication with the rectal canal. Frank, yellow pus, 50 mL, was evacuated from the abscess cavity and sent for culture and sensitivity. No obvious 'sulphur granules' were noted. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well without any complications, and she was discharged with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for 1 week. Pus from the abscess grew Actinomyces turicensis sensitive to penicillin, as well as Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus species. She was followed up in the clinic two weeks after surgery with a clean, granulating wound."
"A 25-year-old male came to the detoxification unit to participate in the clinical trial. His last cocaine use was 24 hours prior to hospitalization. He presented with simple reference delusions with behavioral repercussion; furthermore, he had auditory hallucinations and some simple visual hallucinations. This psychotic pattern developed on day 5 after unit admission, and the episode duration was approximately 4 days. The patient did not have other mental nor neurological symptoms (e.g., his consciousness was never compromised, and no attention deficits were observed). This episode was investigated, and no metabolic etiology was established. A benzodiazepine was prescribed. On the first day of hospitalization, his initial BDNF level was measured: the BDNF level was low (70.94 ng/ml), and this level decreased further 12 days later (49.05 ng/ml).\nThe patient’s psychiatric history included a major depressive (MD) episode, diagnosed 6 years prior, with total recovery. Cocaine and nicotine dependence were diagnosed before his hospitalization. He also had alcohol and benzodiazepine dependence, but had not recently used those substances. He sporadically used cannabis during his youth. No other substances were used. The patients did not have any other mental or medical antecedents, or antecedents of psychotic episodes."
"A 25-year-old gentleman, a victim of high-velocity trauma (bike rider hit by a four-wheeler from behind), was brought to our trauma center. He had a history of loss of consciousness and one episode of vomiting. Patient was paraplegic. On arrival, patient was conscious (Glasgow Coma Scale-15) and airway and breathing were normal. Patient had a pulse rate of 98 and blood pressure of 140/80. Pelvic and chest compression tests were positive. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma was positive with mild hemoperitoneum.\nNoncontrast computerized tomography (NCCT) head with cervical spine and contrast enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen were done. It revealed transverse fracture through L2 vertebral body with grade III spondylolisthesis of L2 over L3 causing severe neural canal compromise []. Patient also had aortic dissection at the isthmus with traumatic aneurysm formation, mediastinal hematoma, and right mild hemothorax []. He had grade II liver laceration with hemoperitoneum. Patient had multiple pelvic fractures including iliac bone and ischiopubic rami. NCCT head revealed mild intraventricular hemorrhage.\nAfter initial resuscitation and endovascular management of the aortic injury, detailed neurological evaluation was done. Patient had a complete loss of sensation and motor power of both lower limbs in areas distal to L1 dermatome with complete loss of bladder and bowel control. To evaluate the neurological injuries, a MRI was done which revealed complete cord transection at the lower border of D11 and absence of cord tissue from D11 to L1 levels. The distal cord segment was noted to be lying clumped up inferiorly at L2-L3 level with severe compression and stretching across the site of spondylolisthesis [Figures and ]. However, the continuity of cord could be clearly made out at the level of spondylolisthesis.\nThe spinal injury was managed by fixation with rods and pedicle screws (D12, L1, L3, and L4). Aortic injury was managed by endovascular stent-graft []."
"A 25-year old adult healthy male reported to the ENT outpatient department with the complaint of swelling in the left tonsillar region for the last 3 months following an episode of acute tonsillitis. On detailed history taking the patient revealed that at times he did have odynophagia and bouts of acute jabs of pain in the left tonsillar region. On examination a pale yellow swelling was seen in the region of left tonsil, which had a soft and cystic feel and was tender on palpation (). It would be prudent to note that patient had no fever, trismus, and pain in throat or any signs of inflammation in the tonsillar region. Jugulodigastric lymphnodes were also not palpable. A differential diagnosis of tonsillar cyst, any benign lesion like lymphoma and malignancy was made. However, the needle aspiration revealed pus.\nA computed tomography with contrast enhancement (CECT) scan was done which revealed: a well defined thick walled abscess in the left tonsillar region measuring 1.7x1.8 cm in cross section and 2.2 cm in cranio caudal extent (). Thus a final diagnosis of left intratonsillar abscess was made. The patient was treated with needle aspiration of the abscess and antibiotics for 7 days: amoxicillin + clavulinic acid and metronidazole (the culture sensitivity report for pus was sterile). But the abscess did not resolve and hence finally incision and drainage (I & D) of the abscess was done under general anesthesia. The said lesion resolved. Post-operative period was uneventful (). The patient is in regular follow-up with us for the past 3 months with no untoward incident to report."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 48-hour history of progressively worsening epigastric and left upper quadrant pain. He was febrile with an elevated white blood cell count of 18.23×103/L. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast demonstrated a bowel perforation (). He underwent an emergent surgical laparotomy with repair of two terminal ileal perforations located on the anti-mesenteric border that were not associated with any chronic inflammatory changes or creeping fat. Biopsy of the perforations demonstrated acute transmural inflammation and necrosis with adjacent mucosal ulceration and active inflammation (). No chronic inflammatory changes or evidence of Crohn's disease was seen. Immunohistochemical staining for cytomegalovirus was negative. The patient was in good health until 5 months prior to admission when he sought medical attention for painful aphthous oral ulcers producing bilateral mandibular tooth pain. Four months later, he returned complaining of a diffuse papulopustular rash and chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed changes consistent with pericarditis, and an echocardiogram showed no pericardial fluid. He was treated with indomethacin for 10 days before presenting with two ileal perforations. Post-surgical laboratory studies showed an elevated c-reactive protein (CRP) of 35.57 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 82 mm/h. Antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, proteinase 3 antibody, myeloperoxidase antibody, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, and urinalysis were all negative. A serum protein electrophoresis showed inflammatory pattern with low albumin of 2.9 g/dL, and an IgA lambda small monoclonal antibody was noted. Both C3 and C4 complement levels were normal. Sjogren's syndrome antibody-A (SSA) and -B (SSB), Smith antibody (SM), scleroderma-70 (SCL-70), and anti-Jo-1 antibodies were all negative. Pathergy test was also negative. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) were positive. CT-angiogram of abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast revealed no evidence of vasculitis. Five days prior to discharge from his 27-day hospital course, his bilateral tooth pain and pericarditis symptoms recurred. Repeat ESR was elevated at 87 mm/h, and repeat CRP was elevated at 14.82 mg/dL. He was discharged on colchicine and prednisone. He reported relief from his pericarditis symptoms and denied any gastrointestinal complaints at his first follow-up outpatient visit."
"A 25-year-old girl, without any history of trauma or any other significant medical history or any family medical history, presented with white patch over her nose for 3 years. It started as erythema, expanding gradually, and finally turned out to be a white patch without any symptom. Examination revealed a well-demarcated, mild atrophic porcelain-white patch with a violaceous periphery over the left side of her nose. Close inspection of the affected area revealed the presence of the comedo-like openings on the surface of the lesion []. There were no other sites involved, and systemic examination was normal. Histopathologic examination of the lesion showed atrophy of the epidermis, follicular plugging, focal basal cell vacuolization, and homogenization of dermal collagen along with a moderate lymphomononuclear cell infiltrate [Figure and ]. Hemogram, serum biochemistry, and other examinations were normal. All of these findings were consistent with the diagnosis of LS. After the diagnosis was made, oral triamcinolone was prescribed with 8 mg/day combined with topical 0.1% tacrolimus twice a day, the lesion does not expand anymore with partial remission."
"A 25-year-old woman referred to our department with infected discharge at her previous Pfannenstiel incision. We obtained the patient’s consent to report the case. She had Cesarean section 13 months before with no early complications. Her baby was healthy. Two months afterward, she presented with an abdominal wall mass around the incision. In addition, she had pain and infected vaginal discharge. She was given medical treatment with antibiotics by her treating physician. Two months later, she had surgery for the drainage of her collection with a drain left in place. However, afterward she had discharge from other points in the incision line. Finally after 2 months, she was subjected to another surgery, consisting of wound exploration, excision of the fistula tract, and open drainage. Nevertheless, the discharge continued and she referred to our clinic. On examination, she had a Cesarean section scar in the suprapubic region with some holes with a pussy discharge.\nWe performed fistulography by injecting the contrast material from one of the holes in the skin () under the guidance of computed tomography (CT) (). The radiologist reported 20×9 mm complex fistula tracts in the images. Ultrasound and cell blood count were normal. We decided to perform surgery. Intraoperatively, we first injected methylene blue dye from the fistula opening and followed the tracts in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and peritoneal cavity. We thereafter debrided the necrotic tissues. We found the main route to the abdominal cavity, and then we did laparotomy and enterolysis. The tract ended in the anterior wall of the uterus. We debrided the whole necrotic tissue in the uterus and performed drainage with a catheter (#18).\nPathological examination showed foreign body reaction, inflammatory necrosis of the uterine muscle, and a fistula tract in the muscular wall of the uterus with granulation tissue formation, hemorrhage, and fibrin deposition (figures and ). The patient recovered after surgery. At 8 months’ follow-up, she did not have recurrence or any gynecological problems."
"A 25-year-old, 167 cm, 64 kg female patient, diagnosed with a papillary thyroid carcinoma presented for a robot-assisted endoscopic total thyroidectomy. In computed tomography, the right thyroid lobe showed an 8 mm sized nodule. Her medical history was unremarkable. Her mouth opening was restricted to two fingers due to trismus owing to an erupting wisdom tooth. The pre-operative electrocardiogram (ECG), chest and neck radiographs, laboratory investigations and indirect laryngoscopic findings were normal. In the operation theatre, routine monitors (ECG, pulse oximeter, capnograph and non-invasive blood pressure) were applied. After pre-oxygenation, anaesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam 1.5 mg, fentanyl 80 μg, propofol 70 mg and atracurium 50 mg. On direct laryngoscopy (prior to giving the neuromuscular blocking agent), Cormack and Lehane Grading was 2B and both the vocal cords were mobile. The trachea was intubated with an ID 7 mm cuffed reinforced Lo-Contour™ flexometallic endotracheal tube (ETT) (Covidien, Mallinckrodt Medical Ltd., Athlone, Ireland) using the C-Mac D-Blade™ video laryngoscope. The tracheal cuff was inflated, and a circle system with inspiratory and expiratory tubings twice the standard length (improvised in advance) was connected. After capnographic confirmation of proper placement, the tube was fixed on the left side of the mouth at the 19 cm mark. A bispectral index-guided intravenous propofol infusion along with desflurane in 66% air-oxygen mixture was utilised for the maintenance of anaesthesia. Continuous atracurium infusion was given under peripheral nerve stimulator monitoring of neuromuscular blockade. Ventilatory parameters were adjusted to maintain an end-tidal CO2 between 35 and 40 mmHg.\nThe patient was placed in supine position with head extended, neck flexed, right arm abducted and the left arm adducted. The robotic arms were inserted via the right axillary approach after utilising a Chung's retractor to facilitate exposure []. At the end of surgery, after reversing the neuromuscular blockade, on insertion of the video laryngoscope, we found the right true vocal cord to be immobile. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with morphine infusion, intraoperative subcutaneous ropivacaine infiltration and 1 g intravenous paracetamol infusion were utilised for post-operative pain relief."
"A 25-year-old female patient was scheduled for posterior internal fixation and correction due to Klippel–Feil syndrome with scoliosis. X-ray of the cervical spine revealed a fusion of C2-7 vertebrae and partial atlantoaxial fusion []. The patient had a short webbed neck with limited neck extension and flexion (<20°), lower posterior hairline, and thoracicscoliosis. It looked like her head grew right out of her chest. Her mouth opening was normal and was assessed as Mallampatti Grade II. Difficult airway was anticipated, glidescope video laryngoscopy (GVL) was selected as the first choice with fiberoptic bronchoscopy as plan B. Difficult airway cart was also available for back-up. After preoxygenation, the patient was induced with propofol, rocuronium, and fentanyl. The patient had difficult ventilation and GVL revealed Cormack–Lehane Grade IV view. The first two attempts of fiberoptic-guided tracheal intubation failed from oral route and we finally successfully intubated the patient from the nose. Her saturation dropped to the lowest level of 76%. She had an uneventful intraoperative period and extubated successfully after the operation."
"A 25-year-old male presented to us with pain in the right flank for 1 day. He had history of ureterorenoscopic removal of a right ureteric stone 1 year earlier. His vital signs, general physical examination and abdominal examination revealed no abnormality. Urinalysis was normal, and abdominal ultrasound raised a suspicion of small calculi in the right kidney. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) abdomen revealed a few subcentimetric calculi in both kidneys without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. However, it also revealed a large appendicolith of 2.5 × 2.1 cm2 size. [Figure and ] (mineral core), composed mainly of calcium and struvite on spectral analysis [Figure and ]. His routine investigations were essentially normal. He underwent laparoscopic appendectomy using a 10-mm supra-umbilical camera port and two 5 mm ports at the supra-pubic region and the left iliac fossa, respectively. A pre-ileal appendix was found hidden in flimsy adhesions posterior to the terminal ileum. An incidental Meckel's diverticulum was also found [], which was not pathological and was left alone. The mesoappendix was cut using Harmonic scalpel (Johnson and Johnson make) and the appendix was cut at the base between ligatures []. It was removed using a glove bag after enlarging the supra-umbilical incision because of the large stone size — 2.5 cm × 3.0 cm [Figure and ]. The patient had an uneventful recovery."
"A 25-year-old primigravida came for a first trimester ultrasound at 12 weeks of gestation. The first trimester was uneventful. USG done showed a fetus with parameters corresponding to 12-13 weeks of gestation. A membrane was seen attached to the lower limb, restricting the movement of the limb [, ]. An ultrasound done at 19 weeks showed limb anomaly. The right foot was acutely dorsiflexed with oligodactyly- only one toe could be seen and the left foot had inversion []. There was syndactyly in the left hand and oligodactyly in the right. A band was seen connecting the hands []. The features were suggestive of ABS. The couple when counseled regarding the findings opted for termination in view of the morbidity. The pregnancy was terminated and the findings were confirmed. The fetal karyotype was normal."
"A 25-year-old Japanese woman repeatedly suffered from severe respiratory tract infections with purulent sputum since the age of 16. When she was 18 years old, her primary doctor diagnosed her with suspicion of PCD based on nasal mucosa biopsy results. Because her symptoms of dyspnea had gradually worsened, she was admitted to our hospital for a ciliary function assessment. She experienced recurrent otitis media and wheezing dyspnea during childhood, atopic dermatitis at the age of 10, and chronic sinusitis at the age of 18. Her mother was hearing impaired from youth, without symptoms originating in the respiratory tract. She was 169 cm tall with a mass of 50 kg. Her vital signs were as follows: body temperature – 36.7 °C; respiratory rate – 16 breaths/min; blood pressure – 99/64 mmHg; pulse – 100 /min; and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) – 92%. Auscultation revealed bilateral coarse crackles. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from a sputum culture. The fractional nitric oxide concentration in her exhaled breath was 12 ppb (normal range < 22 ppb). Blood examination findings showed a white blood cell count of 15,820 cells/mm3 (neutrophils: 14,630 cells/mm3; eosinophils: 270 cells/mm3) and a C-reactive protein level of 1.66 mg/dL (normal range < 0.3 mg/dL). A chest X-ray showed bilateral tram lines predominantly in the lower lung fields (Fig. A). A chest computed tomography showed diffuse bilateral bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis (Fig. B). Spirometry showed a forced vital capacity of 1.75 L (47.9% of predicted), a forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 0.98 L (30.9%), and a forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio of 55.9%. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the transbronchial biopsy showed complex abnormalities (Fig. ) including the deletion of one or two central pairs (100%), cleavage of the B-subfibers (28.7%), and deletion of the inner (82.4%) and outer dynein arms (23.1%). A video analysis revealed a complete loss of ciliary motion. Therefore, she was diagnosed with PCD. She left our hospital and began home oxygen therapy. Thereafter, she underwent medical observation monthly. Although we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from the patient and her mother's peripheral blood, the well-known genetic mutations that cause PCD were not detected."
"A 25-year-old female presented to a local hospital for acute onset of a central scotoma in the left visual field. The neurologist collected a visual acuity (VA) of 20/20 in OD and 10/20 in OS; pupil examination as well as optic nerve examination by direct ophthalmoscopy was normal. A retrobulbar optic neuritis was suspected so that a contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging scan was requested. This resulted normal with no signs of optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis. She was sent to neuro-ophthalmology, where she presented 2 weeks later. Her past ocular history was positive for mild myopia (−1.75 SF OU); she denied smoke, trauma, or drug consumption, but to specific questioning, the patient reported a flu-like illness 1 month before the onset of her symptoms. She denied pain on eye movement when presented the 1st time with visual loss. The neurologic examination was normal. Her VA was 20/20 in OD and 15/20 in OS. Pupils were equal a briskly reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). Ishihara test was full OD (12/12) but abnormal in OS (7/12); anterior segment examination and intraocular pressure were within normal limits in OU. On fundus examination, a granular appearance of the macula [] was evident in OS with some residual white spots in the posterior pole []. Fundus examination in OD was normal. Optical coherence tomography scan of the macula was positive for a disruption of outer retinal layers [] well matching the granular appearance of retinography. Autofluorescence [] revealed a major number of white spots as compared to fundus examination. The patient refused the consent for visual field and indocyanine green angiography. She was diagnosed with MEWDS and scheduled for control at 3 months."
"A 25-year-old 160 cm tall woman weighing 73 kg had recanalization of a previously coiled anterior communicating artery aneurysm. A Spetzler catheter was inserted at the L4-5 interspace and drained CSF but the volume was not recorded. The aneurysm was successfully clipped and the lumbar drain removed. Postoperatively, she was neurologically intact. On POD 2, she became confused and apathetic; this worsened over the next 3 days. She complained of a positional headache, present while walking or sitting and absent when lying supine, ().\nBrain sag was diagnosed by progressive global neurological deterioration, orthostatic headache and computed tomography (CT) findings. On POD 6, an L4-5 EBP was performed with 25 mL of autologous blood. Within several hours, alertness improved, mental status returned to baseline, and headache fully resolved. She was discharged the next day."
"A 25-year-old female, gravida 10, para 0, artificial abortion 10 (G10P0AA10), had a history of dysmenorrhea with irregular duration and intervals of menstrual cycles. She had had no menses for two months before coming to the emergency department with the chief complaint of acute-onset abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding with blood clots. She had neither dizziness nor shortness of breath. Her body temperature (BT) was 37.3°C, heart rate (HR) was 92 times/minute, respiration rate (RR) was 18 times/minute, and blood pressure (BP) was 100/60 mmHg. The pregnancy- enzyme immunoassay test was negative, and beta-HCG was 13.11 mIU/mL, which was in the normal range. In the emergency department, her serum hemoglobin dropped from 13.8 mg/dL to 11.9 mg/dL in 6 hours. The gray-scale ultrasonography revealed multiple varying-sized hypo-echoic lesions (). The color Doppler ultrasonography showed a hypervascular lesion, 4.9 × 3.3 × 2.6 cm with multidirectional turbulent flow (). On admission, the patient was scheduled for angiography and TAE. The angiography showed the feeding artery from the branches of the right internal iliac artery and tortuous veins with relatively early venous return (), which indicated the diagnosis of uterine AVM. Superselective TAE of the right uterine artery using N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) was performed at first. On checking the left uterine artery, the angiography showed that there were still a few abnormal collateral vessels (). Therefore, bilateral uterine artery embolization was performed (). After the interventional treatment, the patient had mild dull pain in the lower abdomen, which was most likely related to ischemia, and could be relieved by oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). There was no more vaginal bleeding during hospitalization, and she was discharged 2 days after interventional treatment. Forty days after TAE, her menstrual bleeding started, and the follow-up ultrasonography showed no abnormal flow."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to our institution with a swelling in the lower left posterior region of lower jaw for 2 months that followed the extraction of 36 []. The swelling was gradually increasing in size. Medical history was not significant. Extraoral examination revealed swelling that was bony hard and nontender on palpation. Overlying skin was normal. Submandibular lymph nodes were not palpable. Intraoral examination revealed swelling extending from the left second premolar to the second molar region, causing the expansion of both buccal and lingual aspect of alveolar ridge [Figures –]. Radiographic examination (intraoral periapical radiograph [IOPA and OPG]) revealed well–defined, unilocular radiolucency with sclerotic borders in relation to 35–37 and 36 were missing [Figures and ]. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, a provisional diagnosis of residual cyst or odontogenic keratocyst was made. Enucleation of the cyst was done and sent for histopathological examination."
"A 25 year old gentleman had an inversion injury to his left ankle. He complained of lateral ankle and posterior heel pain and swelling after the injury. He was treated by a bonesetter and the lateral ankle pain subsided but he still complained of posterior heel pain. He attended our orthopaedic clinic 5 months after the injury. The posterior heel pain had improved by that time. Radiograph of his left ankle revealed solid, smooth periosteal reaction at posterior aspect of left distal tibia (). No definite fracture was detected. MRI showed periosteal reaction at the corresponding site, which was better demonstrated in CT scan (). Follow up MRI at 9 months after the injury () and CT at 1 year after the injury () showed maturation of the new bone formation at the site of periosteal reaction. Findings are compatible with subperiosteal hematoma formation from injury, which ossified with time. The patient became asymptomatic 9 months after the injury and there was no more local tenderness or swelling."
"A 25-year-old African American male was diagnosed with CML-CP at an outside institution in November 2001. He was initially observed and then received Gleevec, which controlled his disease. In January 2005, he transformed to blastic phase and received induction therapy with ARA-C, followed by Gleevec (800 mg daily), without cytogenetic remission. In May 2005, he presented to UAB with severe fatigue and weakness in addition to weight loss. He had a WBC count of 138,000/µL with 28% blasts. A follow-up bone marrow biopsy revealed AML with 90% myeloblasts. Dasatinib treatment as a part of clinical trial was initiated and he was also put on hydrea and allopurinol in order to decrease the cell count. The disease was well controlled over the course of 12 months. In May 2006, he developed blast crisis for which he received two cycles of MEC chemotherapy. He was then enrolled in the SKI-606 (bosutinib) study and had a remarkable response. However, while on this study drug, he developed severe headaches and imaging studies revealed a large temporal mass. This area was biopsied and diagnosed as MS. The patient received radiation therapy with complete resolution of the mass and had no hematologic disease. In the following next months, the patient had relapsed central nervous system (CNS) disease, diagnosed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), necessitating more radiation. He was then included in a study with nilotinib for tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant disease and failed to show a response. Throughout his clinical course, the complications of treatment included MRSA bacteremia, pericardial tamponade, and aspergillus pneumonia. Additionally, he underwent splenectomy for chronic thrombocytopenia. The patient expired in the next 2 months."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented to Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Mustafa Kemal University (Hatay, Turkey) with a complaint of painless gingival swelling that had persisted for one year. On clinical examination we observed a well-demarcated, firm swelling in the region of the lower left first molar vestibular gingiva.() There was no bleeding upon probing or deep periodontal pocket. The probe depth averaged 2 mm. Radiographic examination did not reveal any changes in the associated bone. () In addition to general gingival health, the periodontal condition of the mandibular left first molar was healthy. The mass had an ulcerative surface and was measured to be 5×5 mm in diameter. No anesthesia/paresthesia was present. His medical and family history were unremarkable.\nAs a result of the narrow periodontal probing depth, we chose blunt dissection for the excision of the mass. During excision of the mass, the keratinized gingival structure was preserved to the extent possible. The excised lesion was placed in 10% buffered formalin solution and sent for histopathological assessment. The flap was repositioned and sutured with 4/0 non-resorbable silk suture. Amoxicillin 1 g/12 hr per oral was administered for the following 7 days, while ibuprofen was prescribed as an analgesic along with chlorhexidine gluconate rinse (0.12%). We confirmed the diagnosis of angioleiomyoma through histological examination via hematoxylin-eosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) staining. In the histopathological report, the angioleiomyoma was composed of spindle shaped smooth muscle cells (SMC) nested in dilated vascular structures with prominent endothelial cells. SMA immunohistochemistry stained positive in tumoral SMC and the vascular smooth muscle layer. SMA positivity suggested leiomyoma.() The postoperative recovery of the patient was uneventful and his sutures were removed after 7 days. The patient remained free of recurrence after one year of follow-up."
"A 25-year-old woman with family history of pulmonary TB was presented to the Gynecology outpatient department with primary infertility and oligomenorrhea of 3 years. On examination, she was moderately built with body mass index of 23.2 kg/m2. Heart, chest, and abdominal examination were normal. Speculum examination revealed healthy cervix and vagina. Vaginal examination demonstrated anteverted uterus with fullness and induration in both fornices. On investigations, complete hemogram and chest X-ray were normal; Mantoux test was positive. Hysterosalpingogram which was already performed by the referring doctor for infertility before diagnosis of FGTB was made showed bilateral tubal block. Endometrial aspirate performed in premenstrual phase showed positive polymerase chain reaction based on the amplification of the 240 bp region of the MPT 64 gene using primers MPT 1 (59-TCCGCTGCCAGTCGTCTTCC-39; nt 460–479) and MPT 2 (59-GTCCTCGCGAG TCTAGGCCA-39; nt 700–681) with equipment using Amplitron thermocycler (Barnstead/Thermolyne), it also tested positive for culture for mycobacterium tuberculosis using Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube-960. Histopathology demonstrated secretory endometrium with no epithelioid granulomas. On diagnostic laparoscopy, there were findings of TB in the pelvis in the form of multiple tubercles on tubes and uterus, bilateral hydrosalpinx with beading of tubes, and few caseous nodules. When methylene blue dye was injected in the uterus, the fallopian tubes became distended and blue colored with beading looking with alternate constrictions and dilatation looking-like “blue pythons” []. Diagnosis of genital TB was made, and she was started on anti-TB therapy. Her postoperative period and follow-up were uneventful."
"A 25 year old female patient presented to the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics with a chief complaint of pain in the region of the mandibular right first molar. She reported that an emergency access opening was performed one week prior for the same. Upon clinical examination, extensive destruction of the coronal tooth structure was noted (). Radiographic analysis revealed a periapical radiolucent lesion around the mesial and distal root of tooth #46, and the periradicular dentin at the coronal third of the mesial root was compromised as a result of the poor endodontic access cavity ().\nBased on the clinical and radiographic findings, a treatment plan was made. Endodontic therapy was initiated (). Following the cleaning and shaping of the canals, calcium hydroxide (Avue Cal, Dental Avenue, Param Enterprises, Pune, India) was placed as an intracanal medicament for one and half months. The dressing was changed every two weeks. Once the tooth demonstrated signs of radiographic healing of the periapical lesion and the absence of symptoms, the obturation was completed with cold lateral condensation and resin-based sealer (AH Plus, Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany, and ) and the tooth was temporised. Since the remaining amount of dentin around the mesial orifice and on the floor of the chamber was compromised and nearly approached the furcation, we decided to place Biodentine (Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France) as a dentin substitute base. The following day, a 2 mm thick layer of Biodentine was placed on the floor and around the mesial orifice ().\nIn order to reinforce the remaining tooth structure and avoid any aggressive prosthetic procedures, it was elected to conservatively restore the tooth using FRC. EverX Posterior (GC Dental Products Corp., Aichi, Japan) was chosen for the procedure. After the setting of Biodentine, the adhesive protocol was followed, which included etching with 36% phosphoric acid (Conditioner 36, Dentsply DeTrey) for 10 seconds, a thorough washing with water and brief blot drying. Two coats of the total etch bonding agent (Prime and Bond NT, Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE, USA) was applied with the applicator tip, lightly air-dried for 10 seconds, and light-cured for 10 seconds. Following this, the FRC was extruded from the compoule and compacted into the cavity incrementally (). Each increment was light-cured for 20 seconds. The overlying 2 mm of the occlusal surface was reconstructed using nanofiller composite (CeramX, Dentsply DeTrey). Finishing and polishing of the restoration was carried out ( and ). The patient returned for follow-up after 6, 12, and 20 months, and the radiographs revealed appreciable healing in the periapical area (, , , )."
"A 25-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital. He suffered from trauma in the right hand in a motorcycle accident. He complained of swelling, functional limitation, and pain in the injured hand. Physical examination showed dorsal deformity of the metacarpal-trapezoid joint without distal neurovascular deficit. Radiographs showed metacarpal-trapezoid joint dislocation without fracture (). Closed reduction maneuvers were performed under regional block with lidocaine 1% without epinephrine of the dorsal wrist branches of the radial nerve, and improvement in the deformity was achieved. Radiographs showed good position and congruity after the closed reduction. Finally, the hand was protected with a Burkhalter splint for 6 weeks and a functional movement rehabilitation program was started."
"A 25-year-old male was presented to our hospital with projectile vomiting in March 2010. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple lesions with oval shaped hyperintensities on T1-weighted image [], and immunohistochemistry of the brain biopsy revealed large atypical CD20 and CD79α positive lymphoid cells. He was diagnosed as PCNSL of the diffuse large B-cell type and was treated with seven courses of chemotherapy (methotrexate [MTX], vincristine, ifosfamide, and dexamethasone) followed by one course of brain radiotherapy (3690cGy/22f/30d for whole brain and DT900cGy/5f/7d for local) in a period of 19 months. Remarkable remission of the lesions was observed []. In October 2012, he was admitted to a local hospital with cataract and vitreous hemorrhage in the left eye and underwent combined phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation and vitrectomy. After surgery, however, his left eye had recalcitrant anterior chamber inflammation, vitreous haze, and increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and was referred to our center in March 2013. On admission, his best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.2 in the right eye (OD) and 0.1 in the left eye (OS); IOP was 21 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) OD and 34.1 mmHg OS; the left eye had mild anterior chamber inflammation with 1+ keratic precipitates, flare, and cells [], as well as scattered white lesions in the anterior chamber angle; dilated examination revealed vitreous opacity and a plurality of white lumps on the surface of inferior retina, while no significant findings were noted in the fundus. B-scan ultrasound revealed vitreous opacity and epiretinal deposits [], and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) showed confluent ciliary body masses with almost 360° involved []. Diagnostic vitrectomy was performed and cytology of the vitreous specimen revealed large atypical lymphoid cells [] which were CD20+ on flow cytometry. Brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow cytologies were negative for malignancy. The patient was treated with ocular intensity modulation radiated therapy (IMRT, 45 Gy). One month later, BCVA of the left eye improved to 0.5 and IOP reduced to 16 mmHg without any IOP-lowering drugs, accompanied by a resolution of intraocular inflammation. UBM demonstrated regression of the ciliary body lesions []."
"A full term female neonate born out of a nonconsanguineous marriage by cesarean section (indication-previous cesarean section with polyhydramnios) to a 25-year-old (weight – 58 Kg, height – 155 cm) booked G3P1L1A1 with unremarkable antenatal history. There is no significant history of drug intake. Family history revealed that the father has radial ray deformity of left upper limb without any cardiac anomaly.\nPhysical examination revealed an active baby weighing 2790 g and length of 49 cm, heart rate of 146/min, blood pressure of 70/30 mm of Hg, respiratory rate of 40/min, and systemic oxygen saturation of right upper limb being 83% in room air and that of right lower limb being 74% in room air []. On musculoskeletal examination, left upper limb shortening was noticed with absent radius bone, radial flexion deformity of the wrist and also absent thumb []. Triphalangeal thumb was seen in the right upper limb []. No obvious deformities were noticed elsewhere. On cardio-vascular system examination, the pansystolic murmur of grade III at the mitral and left parasternal area was heard. Per abdominal and respiratory system examination was within normal limits.\nOn further investigation, chest X-ray showed normal thoracic situs with cardiomegaly, plain radiograph of both upper limbs revealed absent radius on left side with absent carpal bones and absent first metacarpal bone and phalanges (thumb), right side showing absent carpal bones and triphalangeal thumb []. No obvious bony deformities elsewhere were noted.\nThe baby developed cyanosis couple of hours after delivery, following which an ECG was done which was normal and a 2D echocardiography was done which revealed severe aortic atresia with hypoplastic arch, large perimembranous VSD and ASD as well []. These findings were confirmed by coronary angiography. The neonate was referred to a cardiac center for further management, however due to lack of resources the baby died on day 4 of life."
"A 25-year-old female presented to the emergency room with dyspnea and substernal chest pain. She had no significant medical history. She was found to be tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxemic. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral acute pulmonary embolism (PE). She was also found to have mild troponin elevation with no signs of right heart strain on echocardiogram. She was admitted to the hospital and started on low molecular weight heparin and warfarin. She was a nonsmoker, was moderately active, and had no known malignancy. During her hospital stay, she experienced some abdominal discomfort. A urinalysis revealed proteinuria, and a 24 h urine collection showed proteinuria >7.2 g/day. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated a right renal vein thrombosis (RVT). Laboratory work showed normal complement levels (C3 and C4), antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, and negative hepatitis B and C serologies. A kidney biopsy revealed membranous glomerulonephritis. She was then referred to the nephrology service for further management of nephrotic syndrome (NS)."
"The patient was a 25-year-old gravida 3 para 1 at 34 - 35 weeks’ gestation, with a history of one previous cesarean section. In April 2015, she was admitted to our medical center in Tehran, Iran due to decreased fetal movement and a probable ruptured membrane. Her vital signs were stable, except for mild systolic blood pressure of 130 - 140, without proteinuria. In her medical history, ultrasonography indicated placenta previa and a suspicion of accreta. Due to uterine contractions, she was scheduled for a cesarean delivery. Under general anesthesia, a Pfannenstiel incision was made. Anterior placental invasion of the myometrium was seen, in addition to prominent vessels. After delivery of a male newborn, weighing 2200 g, with an Apgar score of 8 - 10, partially adherent placenta was separate in some parts. In the lower uterine segment, active and massive bleeding with the placenta in place occurred. Placenta was previa with a 5 × 7 cm of it increate. As a first step, manual compression of the uterus, especially the lower segment, was performed, followed by bilateral uterine artery ligation. In the second step, a B-Lynch suture was placed, followed by myometrial Kerr incision repair and tying of the B-Lynch suture. These steps significantly reduced the active bleeding, but it continued locally in the lower segment. Two compressive sutures in the lower segment were added, and two pieces of Surgicell were placed in the front of the lower segment of the uterus. A drain was placed in front of the uterus.\nSix units of packed blood cells and fresh frozen plasma were transfused during surgery. At the end of the operation, the estimated blood loss was 4800 mL. Three additional units of packed blood cells, two units of fresh frozen plasma, and five units of platelets were transfused on postsurgery day 1. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for 3 days.\nOn day 3, the patient experienced dyspnea, tachypnea, and fever for 24 hour and then recovered, without additional treatment. Antibiotherapy, including clindamycin and gentamycin, was prescribed for 7 days. The patient was discharged on the 7th day, without a need for a hysterectomy.\nIn the present article, the management of the two cases appeared necessary to the responsible surgeon in their emergent condition, so there was no approval of an ethics committee, and informed consent was not received."
"A 25-year-old female was referred to our institute with a history of diagnostic incisional lumpectomy for right breast lump in August 2014 which on histopathology was diagnosed to be a high-grade sarcoma. After surgery, there was a gradually increasing lump in the right breast.\nMammogram [] revealed a large lobulated dense mass in the area of palpable abnormality in the upper inner quadrant of right breast.\nUS [] showed a large multilobulated solid cystic mass in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast involving the overlying skin with high vascularity and subcentimeter sized lymph nodes were seen in the right axilla.\nContrast-enhanced MRI [] of breast showed a large multi-lobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion in the upper inner quadrant (1–4 o’clock position) of the right breast involving the overlying skin. The lesion appeared hypointense on T1-weighted and inhomogeneously iso- to hyper-intense on T2-weighted images. A cystic/necrotic component with peripheral enhancement was seen along the anterior aspect of the mass. Posteriorly, the mass was extending up to the pectoralis muscle.\nPET-CT (performed at an interval of 10 days, ) revealed a large lobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring approximately 11.6 cm × 9.2 cm × 6 cm in the medial half of the right breast reaching up to the presternal area and involving the overlying skin as well as underlying chest wall. The lesion showed intensely increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake with maximum standardized uptake values of 18.24. Two small indeterminate lung nodules were also seen in the right lung parenchyma which were too small to be characterized. No size significant hypermetabolic right axillary lymph nodes were noted.\nUS-guided biopsy revealed a tumor comprising of neoplastic cells arranged around blood vessels and in sheets. Individual cells were small with scant, pale eosinophilic to finely vacuolated cytoplasm and fairly uniform round nuclei with coarse chromatin and inconspicuous nucleolus []. Few mitotic figures were seen. Tumor cells demonstrate the presence of intracellular glycogen. On immunohistochemistry (IHC): Tumor cells are: CD99 (Dako; 1.20E + 008): Positive, leucocyte common antigen (Dako; 21B11 + PD7/26): Negative, CK (Biogenix: AE1 + AE3): Negative, S-100 (Dako; IS504): Negative, Desmin (Dako; D33): Negative, Bcl-2 (Dako; 124): Positive. The morphological features and IHC profile favored an EES/PNET.\nThe patient was started on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) and post four cycles of chemotherapy there was more than 50% reduction in the size of the lesion [].\nThe patient underwent a wide local excision of the right breast in February 2015."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with a complaint of progressive difficulty in swallowing since 1-year. History revealed the difficulty in breathing during exertion since 1-month. There was no history of throat pain, cough, fever, stridor, hoarseness of voice, hemoptysis, loss of appetite, weight loss, associated comorbidities, or substance abuse. On examination, no abnormality was detected in relation to the oral cavity and oropharynx. Hopkins's laryngoscopy revealed a globular mass projecting into the supraglottis from the lateral wall of the right pyriform fossa []. Right aryepiglottic fold and false cord were obscured by the mass. Both vocal cords were normal. The epiglottis, pharyngoepiglottic folds, vallecula, and base of tongue were also normal. There was no palpable mass in the neck. The rest of the ear, nose, and systemic examination revealed no abnormality. Routine blood, urine, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram investigations were within normal limits. The patient underwent microlaryngoscopy and excision biopsy under general anesthesia. The mass was grayish-white and measured 2.5 cm × 2 cm []. Postoperative period was uneventful. Patient was started on oral feeds on the same postoperative day. Follow-up laryngoscopy on the 10th postoperative day revealed some slough in the right pyriform fossa. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained sections showed round to polygonal tumor cells arranged in cords and small nests having prominent cytoplasmic vacuolization. Intraluminal erythrocytes were noted in many of the vacuoles, reminiscent of primitive vascular channels that were confirmed by CD34 immunostain. There was no evidence of nuclear atypia, abnormal mitosis or areas of necrosis. Based on the microscopic findings of H and E and immunostaining, the lesion was diagnosed as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of pyriform fossa [Figure and ]. Patient has been on follow-up since 1-year without any evidence of loco-regional recurrence or dysphagia []."
"A Black African female aged 25 was diagnosed with PaHIV aged 4, and commenced first-line therapy with didanosine, nevirapine and stavudine aged 8 with a nadir CD4 cell count 420 cells/μL. Virological failure in 2005 precipitated a switch to lopinavir/ritonavir, zidovudine and lamivudine simplified to once-daily boosted darunavir and Truvada with sustained virological suppression for 10 years. In 2012, during investigation for asymptomatic thrombocytopenia (platelets 78–111 ×109/L), CT imaging confirmed non-cirrhotic portal hypertension with a history of 8 years of didanosine exposure in earlier childhood. Endoscopy revealed Grade 2 oesophageal varices and despite B blockade, she has had two subsequent admissions for gastrointestinal haemorrhage to date."
"A 25-year-old male presented with complaints of cough with purulent expectoration, low grade fever and low backache of 1 month duration. Chest radiograph and computed tomography scan revealed features of volume loss on left side with fibronodular opacities. Radiograph of thoracolumbar spine, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [] revealed bilateral psoas abscess. He was started on antitubercular treatment and pigtail catheters were placed under ultrasonography guidance in both abscess cavities. 150 ml and 60 ml of viscid, thick and purulent material was drained from right and left pigtail catheters respectively. Repeat ultrasonography revealed no residual collection on right side and a significant collection with thick internal septations on left side. Right pigtail catheter was removed. Three doses of injection UK 50,000 IU each in 25 ml of normal saline were instilled 8th hourly with a dwelling time of 2 h between each dose through the left pigtail catheter. There was a net total drainage of 200 ml of thick purulent material. Subsequent ultrasonography revealed no residual collection and left pigtail catheter was also removed. His anti-tubercular treatment was continued. His repeat MRI of thoracolumbar spine after 6 months revealed complete resolution of bilateral psoas abscesses []."
"A 25-year-old male presented with absent left testis since birth and right sided inguinal swelling for 5 years, and pain in swelling for 2 days. On physical examination, the left scrotum was empty, and right side revealed indirect inguinal hernia with right testis at the root of the scrotum. The penis was well developed. The patient was phenotypically male, exhibiting normal secondary sexual characteristics. The past history indicated primary infertility.\nSemen analysis revealed azoospermia. Ultrasonography showed right inguinal hernia with undescended testis in the right inguinal canal and an absent testis on the left side.\nSurgical exploration revealed indirect sac with the right testis. While retrieving the testis, we noticed a complex mass resembling uterus-like structure, and gonad (left) with the fimbria-like structure [].\nBoth the gonads had vas deferens and vascular supply. Orchiopexy was done on the right side. The uterus like structure was removed along with left gonad as it was atrophic and sent for histopathology. Right inguinal hernioplasty was done.\nHistopathological study proved it to be uterus [] and left gonad like structure proved to be testis which was atrophic without spermatogenesis [].\nChromosomal analysis revealed normal male genotype – 46 XY []."
"A 25-year-old female patient of South Asian origin presented to the neurology department with two self-terminating, secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She had a history of NCC in childhood, diagnosed aged 8 while she was living in India. She received antiepileptics (stopped after 3 years without medical advice) and antiparasitic agents at the time. She remained seizure-free for 10 years and had an uneventful first pregnancy, but re-presented with seizures 3 months postpartum. There was no significant travel history in the last 5 years. She underwent an MRI brain scan, which demonstrated a 5.2-mm focus of calcification in the cortex of the right posterior parietal lobe with no enhancement, consistent with previous NCC (Fig. ). At this time, the patient was started on lamotrigine and remained asymptomatic on lamotrigine 50 mg BD.\nThe patient remained stable on lamotrigine until 21 weeks gestation in her second pregnancy, when she presented to the neurology clinic with a 2-day history of headaches, vomiting, change in behavior and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She was normotensive on admission and a repeat MRI brain performed demonstrated moderate edema surrounding the previously known calcified lesion in the right parietal lobe (Fig. ).\nThe dose of lamotrigine was increased to 100 mg BD and levetiracetam 250 mg BD was introduced to control the seizure activity. No antihelminths were initiated at this point. The patient's headache resolved as an inpatient and she experienced no further seizures. An MRI brain 6 weeks post-discharge confirmed resolution of the edema surrounding the calcified cyst and her Taenia solium serology came back negative. Labor was induced early for obstetric indications and she delivered a healthy male infant."
"A male baby was born to a 25-year-old mother at 30 weeks of gestation. The mother had presented in emergency with preterm labor and her antenatal ultrasonography (US) done at 26 weeks was suggestive of polyhydramnios. The baby was delivered vaginally and weighed 1.2 kg. As the baby did not cry immediately, endotracheal intubation was attempted to secure the airway but the vocal cords could not be visualized and there was a single opening corresponding to the esophagus. Resuscitation was hence continued with bag and mask ventilation and baby was shifted to the NICU where a second attempt was made to intubate which failed again. As the baby's condition worsened, the endotracheal tube was passed in the visualized opening, after which the saturations improved. In view of X-ray chest [], suggestive of severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), natural bovine surfactant with 100 mg/kg of phospholipids was given through the “endotracheal tube,” which showed improvement suggesting that a connection existed between the esophagus and trachea. On invasive ventilation with high-pressure support and 100% FiO2, the saturations were maintained at 85%. The baby also had an imperforate anus, a structurally normal heart on echocardiography, and normal abdominal US. Because of the critical condition of the baby, computed tomography (CT) was not attempted but a water-soluble dye was instilled through the endotracheal tube which showed the esophageal tracheal connection []. The baby further got complicated with a developing pneumoperitoneum, which was drained, but the baby died at 48 h of life."
"A 25-year-old man born out of a non-consanguineous marriage presented to us with thickened nails that had developed around 12 years of age. Over next few years, he developed multiple, small raised lesions over the scalp, eyebrows and beard area followed by gradual loss of hair over these areas. History of natal teeth, development of blisters on palms and soles following minor trauma, and focal thickening of palms and soles was present. No other family members had similar complaints.\nOn general examination, there was no pallor, icterus, clubbing, cyanosis or lymphadenopathy.\nSystemic examination was normal. On dermatological examination, there was a hyperkeratotic plaque over the left sole with surface showing ulceration [] and was associated with palmoplantar hyperhidrosis. All finger and toe-nails were wedge-shaped with yellowish discoloration and subungual hyperkeratosis []. Over the scalp, multiple soft discrete shiny nodulocystic lesions were present []. Follicular papules and sparse woolly hair were seen over scalp, beard, and eyebrows []. The central lower incisors were absent as natal teeth had fallen prematurely and had not been replaced []. Oral leukokeratosis was absent.\nNail clippings for KOH mount and fungal culture were negative. Skin biopsy of hyperkeratotic lesion on the sole showed orthohyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and acanthosis. Complete blood picture, routine blood biochemistry, and urine analysis were within normal limits. On puncturing a cystic lesion over scalp, sebaceous material was obtained. Histopathological examination of follicular papules over eyebrows revealed follicular orthokeratotic keratin plug and mild perivascular mononuclear infiltrate suggestive of follicular keratoses. Due to lack of infrastructure, genetic testing could not be conducted. The patient was managed with Acitretin 25 mg per day and his nails were pared for symptomatic relief. He was also prescribed 40% urea cream for thickened nails and iontophoresis was performed regularly for hyperhidrosis."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with the chief complaint of malalignment of teeth since childhood. History revealed that the patient had difficulty in hearing from the left ear since childhood.\nOn extra-oral examination, a transverse cleft was present in right angle of mouth, with preauricular tissue tags and incompetent lips. Bilateral asymmetry of face and macrostomia was present and inter-incisal distance was 43 mm. On intraoral examination, 16 and 47 were missing with spacing between 1112 13 14 42 43 44, proclined 1112 13 43, cross bite in relation to 24 34, increased overjet and high arched palate [Figures –].\nCorrelating the history and clinical findings a provisional diagnosis of hemifacial microsomia was given. Differential diagnosis of Goldenhar Syndrome was considered but could be difficult because of the variety of clinical signs. Collins and Wildervanck Syndrome (Syndroma cervicoocuioacusticum) must also be distinguished. Goldenhar Syndrome can be classified as a variant of hemifacial microsomia, OAV spectrum, or OAV Dysplasia by some authors.[]\nOther craniofacial anomalies such as Treachers Collin's Syndrome, mandibulofacial dysostosis,[] Miller Syndrome, a very rare genetic condition, often referred to as “postaxial acrofacial dysostosis” must also be ruled out. These disorders are characterized by distinctive craniofacial malformations that occur in association with limb abnormalities.[]\nInvestigations were done where OPG revealed reduction in size of body of mandible, condyles, coronoid process and ramus on the right side. The border of the mandible was well defined and intact. The trabecular pattern and the course of mandibular canal were normal with normal surrounding structures. PA view of skull was taken to rule out any developmental anomaly. It revealed reduction in size of body of mandible, condyles, coronoid process and ramus on the right side of mandible with normal surrounding structures. Lateral cephalogram was taken which revealed proclined maxillary incisors with increased overjet. Impedance Audiometry revealed hearing sensitivity of right ear to be in normal range whereas severe loss of hearing was noted in left ear. Consultation with the Ophthalmologist was done, who suggested normal eye morphology with no abnormality. Ultrasonography of abdomen was done which revealed no abnormality.\nCorrelating the history, clinical findings and investigative findings a final diagnosis of Goldenhar Syndrome was given.\nThe patient was then referred to the Department of Orthodontics for his orthodontic treatment, where orthodontic brackets were fixed on his maxillary teeth with nickel-titanium wire []."
"Patient 8, a 25-year-old male, had no family history of cutaneous anomalies. His cutaneous anomalies were localized over the trunk and the limbs, particularly on the right (Figure ). The stature was 181 cm (75th percentile). The right upper limb diameter was 2 cm larger as compared with the left; the right lower limb diameter was 4 cm larger. Lower limb length discrepancy was 5 cm (the right side was longer). There was mild involvement of the right hemiface. Left kyphoscoliosis was present (20 degree of Cobb). The man attended school with good scores. No seizures had been recorded."
"A 25-year-old woman weighing 56 kg and with a height of 154 cm was diagnosed with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, revealing a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dl and hematocrit of 21.5% at admission. The patient's chest x-rays were normal (). Anesthesia was induced with ketamine and rocuronium and maintained with N2O-O2-sevoflurane. CO2 insufflation was performed and the patient was tilted to 20° Trendelenberg position. After intravenous infusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 1,250 ml of crystalloid, and 500 ml of colloid solution over a period of 50 minutes, at a FiO2 of 0.5, arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 39.3 mmHg, PaO2 of 37.3 mmHg, base excess of -6.5, hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dl, and hematocrit 25%. After completion of the operation, delivery of anesthetics was stopped and 100% oxygen was given, followed by reversal of muscle relaxation. Before extubation, the patient showed spasmodic coughing and pink frothy sputum with extrusion of large amounts of foamy fluid. A chest x-ray was immediately taken revealing diffuse haziness over both upper lung fields (). The patient was immediately shifted to the 15° head up position and aggressive treatment with continuous positive pressure ventilation combined with furosemide was initiated. Approximately 1 hour later, 1,250 ml of urine was excreted and ABGA showed a pH of 7.27, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2 of 379 mmHg, base excess of -6.8 at a FiO2 of 1.0. After tracheal reflexes and respiratory functions returned to normal, the patient was able to reach tidal volume of greater than 8 ml/kg and was consequently extubated. In the recovery room, the patient was maintained in a head up position. ABGA showed PaO2 of 147.6 mmHg, hemoblogin level of 15.2 g/dl at 35% venturi mask oxygen. The haziness seen previously in both upper lung fields disappeared in the first postoperative chest x-ray ()."
"The patient was a 25-year-old Japanese woman who had a history of jaundice for 11 years. Her family history revealed that her father had mild jaundice while other family members had normal serum bilirubin levels. The patient received regular medical treatment at a psychiatric outpatient clinic because of truancy. She had been referred to our hospital for extensive evaluation of jaundice at the age of 14 years. Her first blood examination revealed a normal hemoglobin level (12.6 g/dL), slightly elevated reticulocyte count (89 × 106 /L: reference range, 40 to 80 × 106 /L), and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (serum total bilirubin 113 µmol/L) without elevation of liver-associated enzymes. A diagnosis of HS was made based on clinical features including chemical (haptoglobin < 1.0 µmol/L) and hematologic findings (spherocytes on blood smear and increased red cell osmotic fragility). However, biochemical analysis of the red cell membrane proteins indicated no significant deficiency. Thereafter, she persistently demonstrated mild jaundice but not anemia. At the age of 16 years, she underwent splenectomy to prevent the formation of gallstones and to reduce skin itching which was probably induced by jaundice. Subsequently, the reticulocyte count decreased and the serum haptoglobin level normalized. However, she was persistently positive for serum bilirubin, which ranged between 86 and 103 µmol/L, and it was not clear whether her serum bilirubin level improved after splenectomy. Therefore, we suspected somatic hyperbilirubinemia and carried out further examinations. Physical examination was remarkable only for icteric sclera. Extensive laboratory evaluation revealed normal levels of liver-associated enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The haptoglobin level was 6.0 µmol/L with a total bilirubin of 102 and unconjugated fraction of 100 µmol/L. A complete blood count revealed normal numbers of white blood cells and platelets with a hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL. The corrected reticulocyte count was 34 × 106/L. A peripheral blood smear revealed spherocytes. Incubated osmotic fragility was slightly increased. Sequence analysis of the UGT1A1 gene revealed that the patient was heterozygous for a missense mutation (c.211G > A: p.G71R in exon 1) and homozygous for a point mutation (c.1456T > G: p.Y486D in exon 5); that is, she was a compound heterozygote with the p.[G71R; Y486D] + [Y486D] mutations (). As for the parents of the patient, detailed laboratory data could not be obtained, and neither a molecular study of their UGT1A1 gene nor analysis of their erythrocyte membrane proteins was performed."
"A 25-year-old male presented with sudden diminution of vision in the right eye since 4–5 months. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was hand motion in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. The intraocular pressures were 14 and 16 mmHg in the right and left eye, respectively. The left eye examination was unremarkable. With a normal anterior segment, the right eye revealed dense gray vitreous hemorrhage on posterior segment examination and on B-scan ultrasound. The tuberculin skin test (TST) showed an induration of 19 × 22 mm. He underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and endolaser photocoagulation in the inferotemporal quadrant. Peroperatively, sheathing of inferotemporal vessels with retinal vascularization was noted. The vitreous fluid was sent for PCR analysis. He received oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily) postoperatively. A MTB load of 7.61 × 104 was detected by qPCR in the vitreous sample. He was administered 4-drug antitubercular therapy. His BCVA is 6/6 in the right eye at 4 months follow-up. The eye was quiescent and the fundus examination showed clear media, sheathed vessels inferotemporally, laser scars and regression of retinal neovascularization."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with a swelling in the left submandibular region (just inferior to the angle and body of the mandible) associated with pain for two months. There were no “B symptoms” (constitutional symptoms) and symptoms suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient was immunocompetent and there was no family history of tuberculosis. The patient consulted a dentist and he was treated with antibiotics. Due to continuing pain and increase in size of the swelling, the patient was referred to surgical outpatient department. His general physical examination was unremarkable. Local examination detected a diffuse, non-tender, firm, bi-digitally palpable swelling of 8 cm × 5cm in the left submandibular region. The skin overlying the swelling was normal. The swelling was not fluctuant. There was no purulent discharge from the Wharton's duct. The rest of the oral cavity and oropharyngeal examination was unremarkable. The cervical lymph nodes were not palpable. The rest of the systemic examination revealed no abnormality.\nThe complete blood count was normal except for a raised ESR of 68 mm. LFT including the liver enzymes and serum proteins were within normal limits. ELISA for HIV and HBs Ag were non-reactive. The FNAC from the swelling showed a few granulomas comprising epithelioid cells, Langhan's giant cells, and lymphocytes with central caseation necrosis. Special stains for AFB were negative. These features were suggestive of tuberculous sialadinitis. Chest X-ray did not reveal any pulmonary lesion. The radiograph did not show any abnormality in the mandible. PCR for mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive. Patient was started on ATT, i.e., INH 300 mg, Rifampicin 450 mg, Pyrazinamide 1500 mg, and Ethambutol 800 mg for 2 months; INH 300 mg and Rifampicin 450 mg for 7months. The swelling had completely disappeared at the end of the treatment period. At 8 months post-ATT follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic without any swelling."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a complaint of amenorrhea for 2 years, increased frequency of fatty stools, and decreased appetite for 6 months, generalized body swelling of 2 months duration, fever of 1 month duration, pain abdomen off and on. Physical examination revealed pallor and pitting edema of bilateral lower limbs. Respiratory and cardiovascular system examination revealed no abnormality. No past history of tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension. Ascitic tap revealed clear fluid (transudate). Laboratory investigations revealed decreased total protein, 4.4 g/dL (normal 6–8 g/dL); reduced albumin, 1.9 g/dL (normal 3.5—5 g/dL); and low serum amylase, 8 somogyi units (normal 20–200 somogyi units). Routine blood tests and liver and renal function tests were normal. Chest X-ray revealed left-sided pleural effusion. Ultrasound abdomen revealed hyperreflective pancreas [], free fluid within the pelvic cavity, and mildly dilated small bowel loops with thickened wall. Computed tomography revealed atrophic pancreas with complete fatty infiltration (attenuation value = –120 HU), and no demonstrable normal pancreatic parenchyma [ and ]. Solitary calculus was noted within the pancreatic duct near the ampulla of Vater without pancreatic duct dilatation []. There was no dilatation of intrahepatic biliary radicals or common bile duct. Small bowel wall thickening with increased intraluminal fluid and dilution of contrast medium was also evident []. On the basis of the above-mentioned findings, the diagnosis of diffuse pancreatic lipomatosis (secondary to chronic pancreatic duct obstruction by calculus) leading to malabsorption, subsequently fatty steatorrhea, hypoproteinemia, and retention of fluid within the body was made."
"A 25-year-old woman was evaluated for refractive surgery. She was noted to be susceptible to keloid scarring, as demonstrated by the presence of scars on both ears. Preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20 / 16 in both eyes. Preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -6.5 diopters (D) in the right eye (OD) and -6.25 D in the left eye (OS). Ophthalmic examination was unremarkable except for moderate myopia. Preoperative characteristics and demographics are shown in .\nThe uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was 20 / 32 (OD) and 20 / 20 (OS) one day postoperatively. At 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively, the UCVA was 20 / 100, 20 / 20, 20 / 20, 20 / 12.5 and 20 / 12.5 (OD) and 20 / 20, 20 / 20, 20 / 16, 20 / 12.5, and 20 / 12.5 (OS), respectively. The patient was invited to a re-examination 21 months after the surgery, when the SE was -0.125 D (OD) and -0.25 D (OS). No adverse events, including corneal haze, were observed in this patient, and her visual acuity remained at 20 / 12.5 in both eyes."
"A 25-year-old female presented to the emergency department with 7 months of amenorrhea and abdominal pain. She had regular antenatal checkups in a rural hospital, with uneventful first trimester. Antenatal abdominopelvic ultrasound done in that rural hospital at 24 weeks showed a single, live intrauterine fetus with mild polyhydramnios. Examination in our hospital revealed full-term uterus, with inability to palpate the fetal parts. Fetal heart sounds were heard, but feeble. Ultrasound examination revealed severe polyhydramnios and a single live fetus of gestational age 28–29 weeks with cephalic presentation associated with a huge mixed echogenic mass lesion measuring 10 × 8 × 6 cm on the anterior surface of the mandible. A diagnosis of mandibular mass with severe polyhydramnios was made. In view of fetal distress, an emergency lower segment cesarean section was undertaken, and she delivered a male baby weighing 1.35 kg. The baby had a huge pedunculated mass protruding from the oral cavity, arising from the posterior end of palate. Since the baby was in severe respiratory distress, the pediatrician tried to revive and secure the airway, but unfortunately the baby succumbed to death.\nOn autopsy, a pedunculated mass arising from the posterior end of palate through the basisphenoid, measuring 9.5 × 7.5 × 6 cm, was seen protruding from the oral cavity []. The external surface showed bilaterally symmetrical skin buds appearing like developing fetal parts. A postmortem plain radiograph [, ] and computed tomography (CT) scan [, ] revealed a heterogeneous dense mass arising from basisphenoid, with no intracranial extension. Cut section of the mass showed variegated appearance, fat tissue and bony areas. Microscopically, the mass was composed of mature components of all the three germ cell layers comprising stratified squamous epithelium, nervous tissue, intestinal epithelium, respiratory epithelium, cartilage, bony tissue, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and blood vessels [, ]. Foci of immature neuroepithelial components comprising small round cells forming rosettes and tubules were also found []. So, a final diagnosis of epignathus immature teratoma (grade 1) with fetiform features was made."
"A 25 year-old right handed mechanic man suffered injuries to both wrists after a motorcycle accident. Past medical history of the patient was normal. He attended our hospital with painful wrists. The wrists were swollen and deformed at first visit in emergency department. Physical examination showed intact neurovascular. The skin on both upper limbs was intact. Anteroposterior and lateral X-rays revealed fourth stage of perilunate dislocation bilaterally (Figure ,). Because the optimum management of these injuries requires open reduction and repair of the intercarpal ligaments, the patient underwent surgery. Under general anesthesia and tourniquet, the dislocations were treated by open reduction using dorsal approach. Cartilage damage was apparent around the lunate and on the head of the capitate in left wrist. We tried to restore the normal scapholunate relationship. Because anchor sutures were not available, we repaired the intercarpal ligaments directly or by suturing them to the edge of the bones after making through with small K-wires. The reductions were stabilized by inserting K-wires and short arm casts (Figure ,). The K-wires and casts were removed eight weeks later and physical therapy started. The patient was able to return to his previous occupation after six months (Figure ,). At this time patient had mild pain at the extreme active range of motion in his wrists. shows active range of motion in both wrists six months after surgery. Because these injuries can result in late complications like lunate avascular necrosis, instabilities and degenerative joint disease, the patient will have periodic follow up visits."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a small nodule in the right brow since the past 2 years. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20, N6 in both eyes and ocular examination was within normal limits.\nThe nodular lesion measuring 8×6 mm was present within the brow, subcutaneous in location, well-circumscribed, non-tender, freely movable and firm with a gritty surface on palpation. Skin over the swelling could not be well-visualized because of the dense overlying brow hair []. Since the patient was keen on surgical removal, an excision biopsy was performed through a small incision taken just over the lesion so that the scar could well be hidden within the brow hair.\nGross examination showed a well-circumscribed single grayish-white mass measuring 7×5×5 mm. Cut section showed grayish areas, firm and gritty. Microscopic examination showed numerous lobules with basophilic cells in the periphery and of ghost-like squamous cells toward the center with a few anucleated cells []. Various stages of maturation of the basaloid cells into shadow cells could be seen []. These islands are surrounded by foreign body giant cells with a few lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates []. There were numerous foci of calcification more so in the necrotic areas and in the periphery of cellular islands [Figures and ]. The histopathologic features were consistent with a diagnosis of pilomatrixoma (benign calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe)."
"A 25-year-old man, in whom ARDS caused H1N1 virus was diagnosed after four days with fever and progressive dyspnea, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (). He stayed in the hospital for 29 days and returned to his usual activities 2 months after he was discharged. After 6 months of follow-up, a pulmonary function test demonstrated an improvement in forced vital capacity, total lung capacity, and DLCO (), as well an improvement on his high-resolution computed tomography scan (Figure 1). He still had physical limitations, as measured with the 6-minute walk test, 6 months after ICU discharge ()."
"MA, a 25-year-old male, presented with hematuria and left flank pain. On physical examination, he had a left-sided, hard, somewhat fixed mass in the left flank. USG showed a large left renal mass. Right kidney and bladder were unremarkable. CT scan revealed a left renal mass with involvement of renal vein and also liver and lung metastasis.\nA palliative nephrectomy was done. On macroscopic examination, the kidney measured 15×11×8 cm. On sectioning, the entire kidney parenchyma was replaced by a solid, vaguely nodular, gray white tumor with small areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The tumor was seen infiltrating through the capsule into perinephric fat and main renal vein. Histology and IHC were consistent with PNET/EWS.\nAdjuvant chemotherapy was planned but general condition of the patient deteriorated and his disease progressed and he died 2 months later."
"A 25-year-old Chinese male with genital warts for 7 months was diagnosed as condyloma accuminatum and treated initially with external application of 5-fluorouracil injection, trichloroacetic acid solution, and so on. The lesions disappeared completely without obviously pigmentary change. After approximately 2 months, new lesions appeared on his coronoid sulcus of penis and imiquimod 5% cream was prescribed for three times weekly. After 8 weeks of continuous use, the lesions gradually grew down and subsidized, erythema and anabrosis occurred in the areas treated with imiquiod. He was instructed to stop using imiquimod and provided rivanol solution and zinc oil for external using, but the patient persisted in using imiquimod cream up to 18 weeks for being afraid of recurrence of the lesions. One month after the drug withdrawal, the patient observed a depigmentation macula on his penis, which initially looked like a rice grain and gradually enlarged without subjective symptoms. Dermatological inspection discovered an ivory-white patch of nearly 4 cm × 2 cm with irregular edge on the patient's coronoid sulcus and corpus penis [], without any vegetations in external genitals and vitiligo-like maculae on other sites."
"A 25-year-old female had been treated for a rhabdomyosarcoma in her nasal–tonsil region at the age of three. She was first treated with chemotherapy and subsequently with external beam radiotherapy (cumulative dose 59.4 Gy). This treatment resulted in a complete remission of the tumor. No recurrences or metastases were observed during a 22-year follow-up period. The late effects of the oncologic treatment were thin hair, development of cataract, impaired hearing at both sides, trismus, maxillary hypoplasia (Fig. ), hypodontia, microstomia, and malformation of teeth.\nAt the age of 20 years, the same combined surgical and prosthetic treatment plan was proposed to this patient as in patient 1 to correct the midface hypoplasia and to restore oral function. The patient, however, did not want to change her facial appearance, needing an alternative surgical treatment plan. This alternative plan consisted of a Le Fort I osteotomy with ventralization and down grafting of the maxilla to improve esthetics and jaw relationship for prosthetic rehabilitation instead of midface distraction with the RED frame. The patient also refused this treatment and asked for dental rehabilitation only. Notwithstanding this suboptimal approach, it was assumed that the patient would greatly benefit from an implant-based prosthetic rehabilitation.\nAfter 20 treatments with HBO, the remaining maxillary teeth were removed. As the bone volume of the maxilla was insufficient for implant placement, 3 months after teeth extraction, bone from the iliac crest was used to lift the nasal floor and to broaden the maxilla to create bone volume allowing for a reliable placement of dental implants at the sites preferred by the prosthodontist. Three months later, four dental implants (Brånemark TiUnite regular platform, 10 and 13 mm) were placed in the anterior maxilla with the help of a template, followed by ten treatments with HBO. After 5 months of osseointegration time, abutment connection was done and an impression was made. During this procedure, one implant appeared not to be osseointegrated and had to be removed. A milled titanium bar superstructure (Fig. ) and an overdenture (Fig. ) were made on the remaining three implants. The patient was very satisfied with her prosthesis and experienced no problems with her prosthetic rehabilitation during a two and a half-year follow-up."
"A 25-year-old male sustained an unstable burst fracture of L2 and a stable burst fracture of L3 after a fall, and sustained a 90% canal encroachment by the L2 bony fragment. The pre-operative motor power score and sensory score were 22 points and 20 points, respectively, and Frankel grade C neurologic deficit was observed. L2 total laminectomy was performed. Based on the sagittal images of preoperative CT, the amount of laminectomy for the superior adjacent vertebra and the sagittal length of retropulsed bony fragments were expected, prior to performing surgery (). Bony fragments were removed by L2 right partial pediclulectomy, and all bony fragments encroached onto the spinal canal were removed. Three months post-operation, his motor power score was 46 points, and sensory score improved to 36 points. Eighteen months post-operation, his motor power score improved to 50 points ()."
"A 25-year-old lady presented with progressive defective vision in the Left Eye (LE) of 3-month duration. She was a known case of hyperthyroidism and was on medical treatment for the same. There was no history of any previous ocular trauma.\nOcular examination revealed best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20 in the Right Eye (RE) and 20/80 in the LE. The pupillary reactions and slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment were normal in both eyes. Fundus examination of the RE was normal, while the LE showed a yellowish-orange lesion of 1 disc diameter (DD) having well-defined scalloped margins with pseudopod extensions superiorly and subretinal hemorrhage in the fovea []. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed an area of delineation of around 1 DD in the foveal avascular zone. It also revealed a lacy pattern of early hyperfluorescence with leakage of dye in the late phase suggestive of classic CNVM along with blocked fluorescence temporally due to hemorrhage []. RE was angiographically normal. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the presence of the subfoveal CNVM with fluid and central macular thickness (CMT) of 203 μm []. B-scan ultrasonography showed a highly reflective mass lesion around 2 mm in basal dimension in the posterior pole and shadowing of orbital soft tissues posterior to the lesion. A-scan ultrasonography showed a high spike corresponding to the anterior surface of the lesion suggestive of choroidal osteoma []. Thus we came to a clinical diagnosis of choroidal osteoma with secondary subfoveal CNVM.\nSubfoveal classic nature of CNVM prompted us to treat the patient with combination therapy, i.e., low-fluence PDT followed by an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab 48 h later. After an informed written consent and physician fitness, low-fluence PDT with a light dose 25 J/cm2, power 300 mw/cm2, exposure time of 83 s, and spot size of 3100 μm as per standard low-fluence specifications was given. Forty-eight hours post-PDT, 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis; Novartis, India) was injected in the same eye under aseptic precautions. The patient was reviewed 4 weeks postinjection and her BCVA improved to 20/20. Fundus examination showed absorbed hemorrhage and resolved CNVM []. FFA showed minimal hyperfluorescence with staining in the late phase suggestive of scarring []. OCT showed that CMT reduced to 166 μm with the resolved fluid []. At 15-month follow-up, FFA showed regressed, scarred CNVM [] and OCT [] showed dry macula. She maintained the good vision."
"The patient was a 25 years old male. He had symptoms such as stereotypic behavior, screaming, very limited eye-to-eye contact, very limited conversation, forcefully imposing his wishes, doing only what he wanted, not cooperating, and moving around constantly during the psychiatric examination. He has been under our follow-up for the last 12 years since he was 13 and diagnosed as Autistic Disorder at that time.\nHe was prior diagnosed as ‘Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder’ before the age of thirteen and prescribed methylphenidate and developed drug-associated hypertension.\nThe patient was initially administered clomipramine 75 mg/day and pimozide 1 mg/day. Then the medication was shifted to clozapine 25 mg/day. Later, risperidone 1.5 mg/day was used.\nHis family history was unremarkable except for one cousin with autistic features.\nThe cranial magnetic resonance imaging were performed and in axial proton density-weighed (PD-weighted) images, hyperdense signal changes were detected in bilateral putamen, head of caudate nucleus and posterior thalamus (posterior pulvinal) (Fig. ), and minimal signal increases were seen in dentate nucleus in both serebellar hemispheres (Fig. ). In axial T1 weighted images hyperdense signal changes were seen in bilateral putamen, head of caudate nucleus and posterior thalamus (posterior pulvinal) (Fig. ) and in dentate nucleus in bilateral serebellar hemispheres (Fig. ).\nThe tests for genetic mitochondrial disease or metabolic errors of amino acids and organic acids yielded no positive results (corpuscular blood cells, peripheral blood smear, enzyme levels, hormones, blood and urine biochemistry).The patient underwent evaluation by neurologists, biochemists and radiologists, but no etiologic factors could be detected. The present condition was considered to be an unconfirmed ‘metabolic cytopathy’."
"A 25-year-old lady was diagnosed with a large left breast lump in the upper outer quadrant. The tumor size was 6.8 × 5.1 cm. The lump was diagnosed as duct carcinoma on fine needle aspiration cytology. She underwent left modified radical mastectomy in February, 2006. The histopathology report given was infiltrating duct carcinoma grade III, with neuroendocrine differentiation. One out of 13 axillary lymph nodes showed metastasis. There was no extranodal extension. Four cycles of chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamaide-900 mg + Doxorubicin-90 mg) postoperatively was administered, which completed in May, 2006.\nShe developed a lesion on the upper alveolar gingiva in September 2007, which clinically looked like an epulis. A punch biopsy of the lesion was done and it showed a metastatic adecnocarcinoma, which was consistent with a known primary in the breast. [Figures –] Estrogen and progesterone receptors were done by immunohistochemistry, but the original breast tumor and the metastatic lesion were negative for both receptors. The diagnosis of a metastasis was based solely on the histological pattern of the tumor present in the submucosa. The pattern of the gingival tumor resembled the original breast tumor [Figures –]. A CT scan done later revealed a 1.6 × 1.2 × 2.3 cm enhancing lesion in the right gingivo-buccal sulcus. The underlying maxilla appeared normal on CT scan with no evidence of any cortical erosion or break. The underlying teeth did not show any radiological evidence of loosening."
"A 25-year-old Nigerian man presented to our emergency department with complaints of tiredness, night sweats, and dizziness on exertion. On clinical examination the patient had facial swelling and venous distension in the neck. Blood pressure was 135/77 mmHg with pulsus paradoxus. Cardiac auscultation was normal. The liver was enlarged. There was no peripheral oedema. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia of 110 beats/min, a vertical axis, QS pattern in V1 and a Q wave in V2 and low voltages in the limb leads. Laboratory testing showed lymphocytosis, increased creatinine (120 mmol/l) and abnormal liver enzymes (total bilirubin 47 μmol/l, aspartate aminotransferase 124 U/l, alanine aminotransferase 200 U/l and γ-glutamyl transferase 268 U/l). On chest X-ray, right pleural effusion and mediastinal widening were seen. With abdominal ultrasound the liver diameter was 17.5 cm, with ascites, pleural and pericardial effusion and hepatopetal flow in the portal vein. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mass almost completely occupying the right atrium and ventricle with a distended inferior vena cava (Fig. ). The pressure gradient over the tricuspid valve was 25 mmHg (PAP 25 + 15 mmHg). Pericardial effusion was present. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax with contrast injected into the right antecubital vein revealed a mass in the anterior mediastinum with no clear distinction from the surrounding structures. There was a lack of contrast in the innominate and superior caval veins, and contrast filled the right atrium through the inferior caval vein by way of collateral veins. A large right atrial filling defect was found with faint filling of the right ventricle (Fig. ).\nDue to the important haemodynamic compromise, the induction of anaesthesia was possible only after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass with cannulation of femoral vessels under local anaesthesia. A large mass was removed from the right atrium (7 × 5 × 5 cm), but tumour tissue extending into the superior vena cava was only partially removed. Histology was compatible with type B2 thymoma. Moreover, within the tumour, immature T cells were found, with positive CD4, CD8, CD5, TdT and cytoplasmatic CD3 immunostaining. After an uneventful recovery, the patient was referred for palliative chemotherapy with cisplatinum, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. Six months later, after four cycles of chemotherapy, regression of the residual tumour was seen and additive radiotherapy was planned."
"A 25-year-old man from the eastern part of India presented with complaints of passage of white urine intermittently since the last two months. He had no other complaint. His physical examination was within normal limits. On investigations, his hemoglobin was 11 g/dl, total leukocyte count (TLC) of 8600/cmm, and a differential of, polymorphs 70%, lymphocytes 25% and eosinophils 5%. Peripheral blood smears were unremarkable, with no parasites. He was asked to collect the urine sample when it was white. Examination of the urine was performed. Its color was milky-white and it did not clear on heating with 10% acetic acid, but cleared when mixed with equal parts of ether and on being shaken vigorously. Urinary protein was two plus (++) and no sugar was detected. Smears prepared from urinary deposits were fixed in 95% ethanol, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). The smears showed sheathed motile microfilariae having a uniformly tapering caudal end with no terminal nuclei. Occasional lymphocytes and rare red blood cells were also seen []. A diagnosis of chyluria with Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaruria was made."
"On July 30, 2010, a 25-yr-old man was admitted to our hospital because of bilateral loin pain and nausea just after severe physical activity, and that was 2nd episode since 1 month before. He had played football and jogging on a regular base since he was 20 yr old, but there was no problem. He had completed military service in Korea without any medical problem. Five days prior to his visit, he had run thousands of meters for an employment test of a local security company. Just after the test, he got vomiting and loin pain. He endured the symptoms for a few days, but oliguria developed the day before he was admitted. He had experienced same symptoms after same physical activity test, 1 month ago. On admission, he had oliguria. Height and weight were 171 cm and 81 kg. Blood pressure was 143/85 mmHg and body temperature was 36.3℃. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities except bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory tests showed the following: hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL, hematocrit 35.9%, leukocyte count 6,160/µL with normal differentiation, platelet 209,000/µL, total protein 6.7 g/dL, serum sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 4.4 mEq/L, chloride 107 mEq/L, BUN/Cr 29.0/4.31 mg/dL, CK/LDH 87/259 U/L, CRP 1.24 mg/dL, uric acid 2.0 mg/dL, spot urine sodium 45 mEq/L, urine myoglobin(-), 24-hr urine sodium 179 mM/day, potassium 3 mM/day, chloride 231 mM/day, uric acid 517 mg/day, Cr 1.68 g/day, fractional excretion of sodium 4.6%, and fractional excretion of uric acid 66%. The kidney sonographic image showed left kidney/right kidney 12.3/12.9 cm and no abnormal echo texture. After 9 days of admission, marked hypouricemia became apparent with the improvement of renal function: BUN was 18.4 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.66 mg/dL, and serum uric acid 1.4 mg/dL. Gene analysis was done under the diagnosis of exercise-induced ARF associated with idiopathic renal hypouricemia. Peripheral blood sample for gene analysis was obtained from the patient. DNA sequence analysis of the exon 1, 3, and 4 (hot spot for mutations) of the URAT1 gene was undertaken. Gene analysis revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.G774A, p.Trp258Stop) in the exon 4 of the URAT1 gene (). After 11 days of admission, he was discharged with the improvement of renal function (BUN 17.1 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.14 mg/dL)."
"A 25-year-old male presented with a history of boring done in concha of the left ear about 20 years back as religious practice in his village. On examination, there was an elliptical full-thickness defect in the concha measuring 9 mm × 6 mm. There was a 0.5 mm scar around the margin of the defect. The scar was thin, flat, soft, supple and nonadherent. The skin surrounding the defect, on both sides of the ear, was normal and unscarred [Figures and ]. The patient, now employed, wanted the defect to be corrected."
"A 25-year-old male, from the farming community, presented with a lump in the abdomen since 3 years, which was gradually increasing in size but with a rapid increase in size since 4 months. The patient was married with two children and there was no history of erectile dysfunction. Clinical examination showed fullness of abdomen in umbilical, right iliac, and left lumbar regions, both the testes were absent in the scrotum. An ultrasound examination revealed a large mixed echogenic mass measuring 15 × 10 cm located in the right side of the pelvis. The clinical diagnosis was a tumor in the undescended abdominal testis. Serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein were normal.\nPer-operatively there was a large mass in the right side of the pelvis adherent to the pelvic organs along with a rudimentary uterus and one side gonad. The specimens were sent to the department of Pathology.\nGross examination showed a rudimentary uterus of size 6 × 2 × 1 cm with one side gonad of 2.5 × 1.5 cm, which was gray brown and soft to cut, along with two tubular structures. The other side mass was 17 × 13 × 5 cm, cut section of which revealed a tumor that was predominantly solid with dark brown and gray white areas [].\nMicroscopic examination of the uterus showed well-developed endocervical tissue with thinned out ectocervix, endometrial glands in primitive stroma, and normal myometrial tissue. The gonad with two tubular structures showed histologic picture of a prepubertal testis with no spermatogenesis, a fallopian tube, and epididymis.\nThe tumor was composed of groups of cells with clear cytoplasm, centrally placed hyperchromatic nucleus, and prominent nucleoli. These groups of cells were separated by thin fibrous septae with lymphocytic infiltrates and also large areas of necrosis. Focal areas showed syncytiotrophoblast type of giant cells. The histologic picture was that of a classical seminoma []. Internal iliac lymph nodes and omentum showed secondary deposits."
"A 25 year old male was referred to Department of Endodontics with a history of mild pain and swelling in the upper right lateral incisor of 10 days duration []. Dental history revealed root canal treatment done from a private clinic 7 months ago. Medical and family history was non contributory. Clinical examination showed normal number, size and colour of all teeth. A swelling in the palatal aspect of right lateral incisor was observed, but there was no fistulous tract. A temporary restorative material was seen in the palatal aspect of the lateral incisor. Radiographic examination revealed a poorly condensed overextended root canal filling, and an accessory root and canal which was not obturated. An occlusal radiograph and a second intra oral periapical radiograph with altered (mesial tube shift) horizontal angulations revealed an additional palatal root (same-lingual, opposite-buccal: SLOB rule) [Figures and ].\nIn view of the clinical symptoms, periapical pathology and faulty obturation, a non-surgical endodontic retreatment was planned to locate, debribe and obturate the missing root. The tooth was isolated with optra dam (Ivoclar Vivadent) [], and the temporary restoration was removed with high-speed round diamond burs No. 1015 (KG-Sorensen, Barveri, SP). The overextended gutta percha was removed by chloroform and alternatively by Hedstrom (H) and K-file (Densply-Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). Careful exploration of root canals with DG 16 probe revealed two canals one mesial and distal. Both the canals were negotiated, patency was checked and working length was determined by electronic apex locator Root ZX (J.Morita MFG. Corporation, kyoto, Japan) and by files in radiograph []. Protaper files (Densply-Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) with alternate irrigation with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and saline were used to clean and shape the canal. The temporary restoration was removed, and root canals were irrigated and dried with paper points. The obturation of the root canals was performed using lateral compaction technique with AH plus as the sealer. The access cavity was then restored with composites [Figures and ]."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to our department with a mass in the neck (). She first became aware of the mass 1 year earlier, and it had enlarged slowly over that time. There was no history of trauma. Three months earlier, the lesion was excised at a local clinic. After two months, the lesion recurred and showed gradual enlargement. She presented with minimal respiratory discomfort. CT of the neck revealed a multilocular cystic mass localized within the left neck region, which measured approximately 6×5×3 cm. The mass showed expansion toward the trachea and compression of the tracheal air column (). During surgery, the mass was excised. A macroscopic view of the specimen revealed no mesodermal extensions, such as hair or hair follicles. Histopathologic examination revealed a keratinized squamous epithelial lining with the inner surface lined with keratin lamellas (). There were no histological findings of malignancy. Based on these findings, a histologic diagnosis of an epidermal cyst was made. There were no signs of recurrence during the 12 month follow-up period."
"A 25-year-old male was presented with progressive pain of alveolar ridge of maxilla and mandible over 5 years. The pain began 5 years ago and has been aggravated during the last 10 months. The pain was diffuse and compatible with expansile cyst in maxillary and mandibular ridges on panoramic radiography. He was admitted 5 times to Azahra hospital for removal of maxillary and mandibular odontogenic cysts during the previous year. He was referred to our institution for taking 3-Dimetional face multislice CT-scan. In physical examination he had coarse face and prognathism. Non-enhanced Computer tomography of face in axial section revealed two expansile maxillary and one mandibular cyst (Figure , , ). In coronal and sagittal sections of bone window, calcification in entire length of falx and tentorium were detected (Figure , ). In axial section, abnormal bony excrescence arising from left aspect of upper cervical vertebra was also observed (). At surgery, three expansile jaw cysts were removed and the histological examination revealed that they were Keratogenic cysts."
"A 25-year-old male presented with complaints of defective vision in both eyes since early childhood without any complaint of night blindness. Family history was negative. Patient had no history of trauma and did not suffer from pathologic myopia. Visual acuity was 10/200 (4/60) in the right eye and counting finger close to face in the left eye. Anterior segment examination was within normal limits in both the eyes. Fundus examination revealed a large macular hole in the right eye [], a small macular hole in the left eye [] along with multiple small cystic cavities surrounding the macular holes, and peripheral retinal pigment epithelium mottling in both eyes. Electroretinogram (ERG) of both eyes revealed selectively reduced b-wave amplitude. Diagnosis of XLR was made which was substantiated by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Absence of nyctalopia and scotopic and photopic ERG responses excluded other diagnoses such as retinitis pigmentosa and Goldmann-Favre syndrome. OCT showed a large macular hole and rolled edges of the outer retinal layers in the right eye [], a small macular hole in the left eye [] and schisis of retina in both eyes. Macular hole edges showed bulb-like swelling of the retina. Separation of the outer nuclear layer from the outer plexiform layer can be seen underneath the superior edge of the large macular hole while it is still attached to the outer plexiform layer inferiorly. Curling of the separated outer nuclear layer is visible.\nIn view of stable vision since many years and loss of photoreceptor layer from the foveal region no intervention was advised other than observation."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted with complaints of fever, which was mainly in the evening, of nearly 1-week duration associated with cough, breathlessness, and generalized fatigue. He was on standard multidrug therapy (Rifampicin, Clofazamine, Dapsone) for lepromatous leprosy, for the last 2 years, but he was not very compliant with drug intake. He developed ENL for which he was started on steroids for the last 6 months. He did not have any addictions.\nOn examination he was sick looking, and had severe pallor, generalized lymph node enlargement, diffuse erythematous lesions, and nodular tender lesions of varying size all over the body. The scalp and oral mucosa were not involved. At the time of admission his temperature was 40°C, blood pressure was 120/70 mm of Hg and pulse rate was 114/m and respiratory rate was 38/m. Respiratory system examination revealed bilateral scattered crepitations and rhonchi. He had a hepatomegaly of 5 cm below the costal margin in the right midclavicular line and splenomegaly of 3 cm.\nInvestigations revealed Hb 6 g%, total leucocyte count 1000/mm3 (P 85%, L 15%), ESR 130 mm in the first hour, platelet count 3.2 lakhs/mm3, renal and liver function tests within normal limits, MCV 80, MCH 24, MCHC 30, reticulocyte count 3.5%. Peripheral smear showed normocytic normochromic cells with no evidence of hemolysis; WBCs were increased in number with predominance of neutrophils; and platelets were adequate. CRP was 160 mg/l, and slit-skin smear from the ear lobe was tested positive for lepra bacilli, BI 6%, MI 0%. X-ray chest was normal, sputum was positive for AFB, and HIV status was negative.\nWith the clinical scenario and investigation results the diagnosis of Hansen's disease, ENL, pulmonary tuberculosis, SIRS was made. He went into hypotension which was corrected with fluid replacement. Spo2 was maintained at 98%, without supplemental o2. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and DOTS CAT I ATT. The treatment for leprosy was continued. Fever subsided in 3 days and he was discharged."
"A 25-year-old pregnant woman in third trimester reported a growth in the mouth involving lower left posterior region, which bled frequently and interfered with eating. Intraoral examination revealed a large soft tissue mass in the lower left lingual vestibule approximately 3 × 7 cm in size. It had a smooth surface laterally and superiorly except for the region near the teeth where it showed occlusal indentations of upper teeth resulting in small ulcerations. The growth was pedunculated and attached to the marginal gingiva interproximally between 34 and 35, and extended on the buccal aspect covering the entire buccal and lingual surfaces of 34 and 35 [Figures and ]. IOPA radiograph of 34 and 35 revealed a slight amount of interdental alveolar crestal bone resorption, which may be suggestive of pressure effect [].\nThe hemogram of the patient was within normal limits and excisional biopsy of the growth was carried out under local anesthesia. The excised specimen is shown in . Photomicrograph of H and E-stained section shows ulcerated stratified squamous epithelium with an underlying fibrovascular stroma. The stroma shows large number of budding capillaries, plump fibroblasts and areas of extravasated blood and a dense chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate []. The patient's history, clinical, radiographical, and histopathological findings were suggestive of pregnancy tumor."
"A 25 year-old woman presented with a two-month history of a slow-growing, painful mass in her foot. She complained of difficulty in walking due to pain. On physical examination, a painful, erythematous nodule was observed on the right foot (). It was initially considered an abscess for which antibiotics and analgesics were administered with little improvement.\nOn ultrasonography, a well-circumscribed mass penetrating through the subcutaneous tissue to the fascia was identified (). The lesion was completely excised under local anesthesia, and we observed intraoperatively that the mass was deep-seated and attached tightly to the fascia, compressing the adjacent tissue. Histopathology revealed typical bland morphology of benign fibrous histiocytoma, showing spindle cells loosely arranged in storiform architecture (). Thickened collagen fibers were seen among cells and the skin appendages disappeared. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated CD34- and CD68+ focally (), vimentin+, smooth muscle actin+, desmin-, S-100-, factor XIIIa+(). Based on the radiologic, histologic and intraoperative findings, we diagnosed deep penetrating BFH. The mass was completely excised and pain subsided gradually. She has been under follow-up without recurrence for 18 months."
"A 25-year-old female referred with bilateral eyelid swelling and blepharoptosis. She had a history of repeated lid swelling for almost 3 years before the age of 10 years. The patient underwent bilateral blepharoptosis repair at 12 years of age, re-operation on the right lid at the age of 18 years, and laser resurfacing of periocular region at the age of 20.\nOn examination, the patient had bilateral blepharoptosis (margin reflex distance of +2.5 mm on the right and +2 mm on the left side), dermatochalasis with mild lateral hooding, and medial and preaponeurotic fat protrusion. There was no detectable lacrimal gland prolapse.\nThe patient underwent upper blepharoplasty and levator resection. Upper blepharoplasty included skin-orbicularis muscle flap excision, medial fat excision, and partially preaponeurotic fat excision through a hole in the center of the septum. She had an uneventful postoperative follow-up with the exception of lateral hooding of the right lid. An elliptical lateral hooding excision was performed 2 months after upper blepharoplasty. At 1 week post-hooding excision, there was wound dehiscence with clear watery drops discharging from the wound []. A palpable lacrimal gland was found at the wound site.\nThe patient was scheduled for repair of the wound and repositioning of the lacrimal gland. There was a tract from the lacrimal gland to the skin of the upper eyelid at the site of wound dehiscence. The lacrimal gland was repositioned into the lacrimal gland fossa using 4-0 prolene suture. The fistula tract was resected and the wound was closed. The postoperative course was uneventful out the last visit at 6 months after repair []."
"A 25-year-old male, otherwise healthy, presented with diffuse thinning of hair over scalp, especially of the vertex and occipital area, since childhood. He also complained that the nails had an abnormal morphology and had showed inadequate growth since childhood. There were no similar complaints in the family and he had no associated primary dermatologic ailments. He also denied history of any chemical trauma to hairs. There was no history suggestive of any neurological disorder.\nCutaneous examination revealed sparse, fragile, and thin hairs over scalp, specially vertex and occipital area [], and dystrophy of all finger [] and toe nails with thickened nail plates, ridging and distal onycholysis. Beard, moustache, eyebrow, and axillary hairs appeared to be normal clinically. Mucosae, teeth, and sweating were normal. Rest of the cutaneous examination was also normal. Systemic examination was also within normal limits.\nWe did trichoscopic examination of scalp hairs. It showed fraying of cortical fibers resulting in “thrust paint brushes” appearance. Both proximal and distal hair shaft breakage was seen []. Hairs from vertex, occipital area, beard, and eyebrow showed similar features on trichoscopy. Routine blood chemistry including hemogram, total and differential leucocyte count, liver and kidney function tests, and routine urine examination was normal. Patient refused a scalp biopsy.\nBased on above history, examination, and trichoscopic finding, a diagnosis of TN with 20 nail dystrophy was made."
"A 25 year old female patient presented to us with the complaints of shortness of breath since 3 days, which was sudden in onset, associated with left sided chest pain. She was also giving history of fever and cough since 3 months. She had pallor, but no clubbing, jaundice or lymphadenopathy. On vitals examination pulse rate was 100/min; respiratory rate 30/min, blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg and temperature 99°F. Chest movements were diminished on the left side with a slight shift of trachea to the right side. Percussion revealed a hyperresonant note on the left side with markedly diminished breath sounds. Other systemic examinations findings were unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed a moderate anemia (8.6 gm%) with a normocytic, normochromic peripheral blood picture and a high total leucocytic count (12,400 mm3) with lymphocytosis (70%). ESR was 54 mm at the end of 1 hour. Chest roentgenogram done 10 days prior to admission showed bilateral miliary shadows. Chest roentgenogram (PA view) on admission showed a left sided pneumothorax with miliary mottling (). An intercostal chest tube drainage connected to an underwater seal bottle was put on the left side resulting in relief in symptoms, and patient was put on antitubercular treatment. Two days post intercostal chest tube drainage chest X-ray (PA view) showed complete resolution of pneumothorax () and intercostal chest tube drain was removed. Patient was discharged on antitubercular drugs. After 1 month patient again presented to us with severe breathlessness, on repeat chest X ray (PA view) pneumothorax again developed on left side (), urgent intercostal chest tube drainage was done, and patient relieved immediately. Patient was kept in the hospital for 12 days and intercostal chest tube drain was removed. Patient was discharged."
"We hereby report a case of a 25-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency room with sudden onset of shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain. His social history is significant for smoking two to four cigarettes and two to three joints of marijuana/day for the last 8 years. There is no history of significant occupational or animal exposure, intravenous drug use, or use of any medications. His past medical history is significant for sarcoidosis diagnosed 10 years back by bronchoscopy and biopsy. He was started on steroids for sarcoidosis, but was noncompliant to treatment.\nOn physical examination, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. The chest exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as hyper-resonance on percussion over the right lung field. The cardiovascular examination was normal. There was no cyanosis or clubbing. There was no hepatomegaly or signs of chronic liver disease.\nA chest radiograph was performed, which showed a right-sided pneumothorax with no mediastinal lymphadenopathy []. Subsequently, a chest computerized tomography (CT) was performed, which showed severe emphysematous bulla in the bilateral lungs with upper lobe predominance [].\nThe full-blood examination was normal, with no eosinophilia. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was not elevated. An angiotensin-converting enzyme level was performed, which was normal (44; reference range: 12–68). Alpha-1-antitrypsin was also within the normal range (151; reference range: 90–200). Sputum microscopy and culture for bacteria, acid-fast bacilli, and fungi were negative.\nPulmonary function testing revealed a severe obstructive ventilatory defect, with a possible associated restrictive ventilator defect, and no response to the bronchodilator. Gas transfer was significantly reduced.\nAfter excluding all the potential causes of cystic lung disease [] and taking into consideration his new-onset marijuana smoking in the last 8 years, marijuana abuse was thought to be the cause of his bullous lung disease. The patient was treated with a chest tube and subsequently discharged with advice to quit marijuana smoking and further referral to general surgery for bullous resection."
"A 12-day male neonate, weighing 2.5 kg, appropriate for gestational age, born at 38 weeks to a 25-year-old primigravida mother brought to our emergency department during a winter night. Outside temperature in night was 10.0°C. There was no history of diabetes in mother during pregnancy. There was history of oligohydroamnios and cord around neck in utero. There was no history of umbilical catheterization or any intravenous or intramuscular assess in baby. Perinatal period was normal till 12th day of life. Axillary temperature was 36.6°C. Left foot and toes showed purplish and black discoloration with edema []. Pulses were palpable in all four limbs. There were no other foci of infection. Investigations revealed a negative sepsis screen (TLC 9×109/L, I:T ratio 0.12, CRP <6mg/L initially as well as at 24 hrs of admission, micro-ESR 4 mm in the 1st hour, absolute neutrophil count 2.5×109/L); blood glucose 94 mg⁄dL; hematocrit 54%; and VDRL and HIV serology were negative. Two repeat blood cultures were sterile. Doppler studies revealed normal flow beyond the popliteal artery. Protein C and S levels were normal. The baby was negative for anticardiolipin IgM and homocysteine was 10.4 μmol/ L. Magnetic resonance angiography was normal. He was accepting feeds well. Intravenous antibiotics (cefotaxim+amikacin) were given for 14 days and dressing of the involved areas with silver sulfadiazine ointment was carried out twice daily. The toes developed gangrene, debridement of gangrenous part done with amputation of toes. After 3 weeks of stay in the hospital, the baby was discharged and sent to home. The infant is under regular follow-up and is doing well at 5 months of age. The stumps of the amputated toes are healthy []."
"A 25-year-old male reported to the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics for the restoration of his carious teeth. Examination of the oral cavity revealed a well-defined talon cusp i.e 3 to 5 mm in width and extends in height from cemento enamel junction to 1 mm short of the incisal edgeon the facial surface of the maxillary left permanent central incisor and a mild talon cusp on the facial surface of the maxillary right permanent central incisor, and congenitally missing maxilary first pre-molars. Talon cusp of the maxillary left permanent central incisor extended from the cementoenamel junction to 1 mm short of the incisal edge from the crown labially []. Radiographic image shows a prominent V-shaped radioopaque structure superimposed on maxillary left permanent central incisor and mild V-shaped radioopaque structure superimposed on maxillary right permanent central incisor []. The affected tooth responded normally to electric pulp testing. The medical history was non contributory."
"A 25-year-old woman (G1, P1, A0) presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of binocular double vision. She stated that she had delivered her first baby vaginally about 4 weeks before presentation, under spinal anesthesia. The entire pregnancy and peripartum period were uneventful except for moderate neck pain with stiffness and spasm starting shortly after delivery, for which she used ibuprofen every 6 hours for 2 to 3 days. The patient reported no headache, nausea, vomiting, change in vision, difficulty speaking, numbness, or weakness during that time. Two weeks after delivery she started noticing double vision, which progressively worsened to the point where she was having difficulty driving her car.\nThe review of systems was negative for fever, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. She reported no recent or remote head trauma as well as no bleeding tendency or family history of bleeding disorders. She had not taken any medications except ibuprofen for her neck pain.\nThe physical examination did not demonstrate any abnormalities except horizontal diplopia on forward gaze and left lateral gaze. Diplopia disappeared on gaze to the right and when covering either eye. Visual acuity was normal when each eye was examined individually. Speech, visual field, motor, sensory, deep tendon reflexes as well as gait and coordination examinations were all unremarkable.\nLaboratory tests including complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and coagulation parameters were within normal limits (platelet count, 247 × 109/L; international normalized ratio, 1.03). Chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were unremarkable. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed large bilateral subacute SDH involving the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal regions with compression of the lateral ventricles and transtentorial herniation (, parts A through C). A CT angiography of the head and neck did not reveal any vascular abnormality.\nNeurology and neurosurgery services were consulted and the neurosurgical team admitted the patient for surgical intervention and further management. The patient underwent craniotomy with evacuation of bilateral SDH. No other abnormalities were noted intraoperatively, nor did any postoperative complications occur. The patient did well after the procedure with marked improvement of her symptoms. During the course of her hospital stay, the diplopia resolved completely and the patient remained asymptomatic without any neurologic deficit."
A 25-year-old male patient reported to the Chettinad Dental College Hospital with complaint of pain on the left lower posterior tooth (35) which was decayed and had bizarre morphology similar to its counterpart on the right side (45). Both the teeth were larger on all aspects than the adjacent normal first premolar and had a pronounced buccal groove [Figures and ]. Radiographic examination of 35 revealed pulpal involvement associated with a complex coronal and radicular pulpal anatomy. The orthopantomograph showed no evidence of missing tooth in the mandibular arch but presented bilateral impaction of third molars []. The patient was advised to undergo endodontic treatment of 35.
"A 25-year-old male patient presented at St Joseph Dental College, Eluru with painless gradually progressive swelling in the left side of the jaw for 2 years. The intraoral examination of the maxillary and mandibular arch revealed permanent dentition except for the absence of three-dimensional (3D) molars in the maxillary jaw and amalgam filling of tooth 15, 16, 26 and 46. There was no history of trauma present. The extra oral and general examinations revealed no other abnormalities. On palpation, there was diffuse, non tender swelling of 2 × 2 cm involving tooth 36 with the expansion of cortical plates. Radiographic examination revealed periapical radiolucency involving tooth 36, which extends posteriorly. Based on the clinical and radiographic finding, a provisional diagnosis of odontogenic cyst was made.\nFine needle aspiration was attempted to confirm the provisional diagnosis, but it was inconspicuous and this attempted aspiration precipitated pain and inflammation to the subject. No incisional biopsy was done due to non cooperation of the patient. Keeping the view of provisional diagnosis and small size of the lesion, surgical excision with curettage was done under local anesthesia and the excised tissue was sent for the histopathological examination.\nGrossly, the excised mass was brownish-white in color, without encapsulation and soft in consistency []. Cut surface was slimy and gelatinous. Microscopic examination revealed haphazardly arranged stellate, spindle-shaped cells in an abundant, loose myxoid stroma that contains only few collagen fibrils, thus confirming it to be odontogenic myxoma."
"A 25 year-old male professional off-road cyclist accompanying a group of twelve recreational mountain cyclists were cycling on a 25-kilometer upslope dirt road. He was riding about 5 minutes ahead of the rest of the group when he was attacked by two shepherd dogs and bitten on the left knee. He was using earphones to listen to music, so he did not notice the dog barks right before the attack.\nAt the site of event, the victims’ wound was washed with drinking water and dressed at the site of event by the cyclists’ recreational coach. Then the injured cyclist was transferred to the nearest medical center by the group's support vehicle.\nOn admission, physical examinations revealed several puncture wounds on the left knee, with the size ranging from 5 to 10 mm. On examination, no neurovascular or wound infection signs were detected. The physical examination was otherwise normal. Initial wound management was carried out. Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was required following the national guidelines, so the patient received Purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV) and human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG, 20 IU/Kg). Prophylactic doxycycline (100 mg, twice daily) and clindamycin (450 mg, three times daily) was administrated for 7 days, due to the prior allergy of the patient to penicillin. Based on past history of completed tetanus immunization (with the last dose of tetanus vaccine administrated less than 5 years ago), tetanus prophylaxis was not required. The cyclist received all the rabies vaccine doses according to the 5-dose regimen guideline (on days 0, 3, 7 and 14) but the last dose (on day 28). The cyclist returned to sport after 14 days. During 6-month follow up, no complications were reported."
"A 25-year-old man, hailing from Bihar and working in a multinational company, presented with pain in lower back since last 6 months, which was dull aching, nonradiating, and relieved by rest. Pain gradually increased in intensity associated with decrease in walking distance. He had fever in the initial days, which later resolved with medication. He had lost 6-7 kg weight in the last six months. No foray into forested area or residence in neighborhood jungle were observed. Physical examination was unremarkable except for tenderness present over the spine in lower lumbar region (L2-L5). No gross spinal deformity was seen. There was no neural deficit. He was diagnosed as having Pott's spine and was taking antitubercular treatment, prescribed by referral hospital; however, no improvement was noted in the patient. General and systemic evaluation revealed no manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or any underlying immunosuppressive disorder. The CD4:CD8 ratio was normal and HIV status was negative. Chest radiographs revealed no pulmonary lesion and sputum culture was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). X-ray of the spine revealed lytic lesion in the L4-L5 vertebral region []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed destruction of L4-L5 vertebrae, with abscess formation and cauda equina compression []. He underwent L4-L5 instrumentation, with posterior decompression and interbody fusion with tricortical bone graft from the iliac crest []. Direct fluorescence for AFB was negative and the culture and sensitivity for AFB and pyogenic organism were also negative. Fungal culture was not attempted. The biopsy tissue was received in multiple fragments together measuring 4 × 3 × 1 cm. Microscopy revealed fibrocollagenous tissue, normal, necrotic and new bone, degenerated cartilage, and dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, few eosinophils, polymorphs, and several granulomas containing giant cells [Figure and ]. Numerous fungal profiles were seen in the granulation tissue, which were septate and showed acute angle branching. These hyphae were highlighted by modified Gomori Methenamine stain []. After the diagnosis of fungal osteomyelitis, the patient was started on itraconazole 200 mg twice a day for 3 months. At 1 year followup, he was doing well with no complaints of back pain."
"A 25 year-old man was admitted to the emergency department in our hospital due to status epilepticus. He had developed epilepsy at the age of 12 months. Despite taking anti-epileptic medications, the seizures were not controlled. He underwent right temporal lobectomy at the age of 20 (). Although right corpus callosotomy was performed after 2 years, he continued to suffer from seizures. The refractory epilepsy was of a generalized tonic-clonic nature, and occurred 4-5 times a day, each episode lasting 4-5 minutes. The patient could not independently perform activities of daily living because of pre-existing mental retardation, but showed no motor function impairment. He was brought to the emergency department due to status epilepticus. When he arrived at our hospital, he continued to experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures. He was treated with intravenous anti-epileptics and mechanical ventilation was performed after intubation. On hospital Day 3, he regained consciousness and could blink his eyes when directed. However, it was noted that he suffered from complete quadriplegia under the Medical Research Council (MRC) classification for most muscle groups. There were no signs of external trauma on physical examination and no evidence of trauma, such as fracture or dislocation, on plain radiography of the cervical spine (). His condition was diagnosed as Todd's paralysis and further work-up was not considered. On hospital Day 7, motor power showed a total score of 4 on the ASIA motor scale in the lower limbs and 0 in the upper limbs. MRI of the cervical spine was performed and showed high signal intensity in C1 of the cervical spinal cord, without changes in the surrounding tissue or bone (). A diagnosis of CCS was made and steroid pulse therapy was started. On hospital Day 19, the patient was successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation and no respiratory distress was noted. He was transferred to the rehabilitation unit one month after admission. At that time, the motor power of all 4 limbs had a score of 45 on the ASIA motor scale, 13 in the upper limb and 32 in the lower limb. Neurologic level could not be assessed on the ASIA impairment scale because his cognitive impairment precluded the sensory level examination. He scored 9 on the modified Barthel Index (MBI) and managed his bladder with an indwelling catheter. After one month of rehabilitation management, his overall score on the ASIA motor scale improved to 73, 30 in the upper limb and 43 in the lower limb. He was able to stand up from the sitting position. Although he was able to walk with an anterior walker for about 50 meters, moderate assistance of a caregiver was needed. He urinated by valsalva and diaper voiding."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a complaint of double vision on right lateral gaze for 2 months. She was non-hypertensive and non-diabetic. On examination, she had visual acuity of 6/6 in both eyes. Right pupil was 1.0 mm larger slightly in size than left and showed sluggish reaction to light and near stimulation. There was right hypertropia of 10 PD which increased on right gaze and left head tilt suggesting right inferior rectus palsy. There was restriction on depression of right eye in abduction. There was no limitation of movement in the left eye. There was no ptosis. Rest of the ocular examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain revealed a ring enhancing lesion in the ventral midbrain, in the area of tegmentum at the level of superior colliculus, with perilesional edema []. X-ray chest and ultrasound of the abdomen was normal. The patient did not have any feature of immunocompromised state. On the basis of MRI findings and the endemicity of tuberculosis in our country, a presumptive diagnosis of tuberculoma of the midbrain was made. Antitubercular treatment consisting of rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrizinamide was started and on review 3 months later, her double vision and pupillary abnormalities had resolved completely. The treatment was continued for total of one and half years. Follow-up MRI performed at the end of 1 year showed complete resolution of the lesion. MRI was repeated before the stoppage of treatment that is after 2 years and that also revealed complete resolution of the lesion."
"A 25-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with a chief complaint of swelling and pain in the right mandibular region since 1 month. Intraoral examination revealed a firm well-defined swelling in the 46 region. Clinically, 46 was missing and 47, 48 were carious. The overlying mucosa was non-ulcerated and pink in color. Intraoral periapical radiograph revealed a radiolucent lesion in the 46 region approximately 9 mm in diameter with well-corticated borders []. On the basis of clinical and radiographic findings, the differential diagnosis of residual cyst, condensing osteitis, ossifying fibroma (intermediate stage) and idiopathic osteosclerosis was made.\nA surgical excision of the periapical lesion was performed. On the basis of the intraoperative findings during the curettage, it was suspected that the lesion was not a periapical granuloma or cyst of endodontic origin because the small fragments were gritty and hemorrhagic. The curetted material was submitted for histopathological examination [].\nHistopathologic examination revealed proliferating fibrous connective tissue with moderate cellularity, rich vascularity and hemorrhage []. Trabeculae of woven bone and cementum-like material were interspersed throughout the fibrous framework []. Fragments of cellular mesenchymal tissue composed of spindle-shaped fibroblasts and collagen fibers with numerous small blood vessels were observed. The fibrous tissue was devoid of any inflammatory component []. Based on the above features, a diagnosis of FCOD was made."
"A 25-year-old man presented to us with complains of sudden diminution of vision in the left eye for four days associated with frontal headache and pain on eye movement with no signs of upper respiratory infection or sinusitis.\nOn examination he had a visual acuity of 20/60 in the left eye and 20/20 in right eye with a left relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) of 0.9 log unit. Eye movements were full in both the eyes. Fundus examination revealed normal disc in either eye [Fig. and ]. Contrast sensitivity by Pelli Robson was 1.65 in the right eye and 0.90 in the left eye. Color vision was normal in both the eyes (Pseudo-isochromatic Ishihara plate). Visual evoked response (VER) showed amplitude of 10 micro volts and latency of 103 milliseconds in the right eye and 4 micro volts and 130 milliseconds in the left eye. Goldmann visual field charting was normal in the right eye with baring of blind spot in the left eye [Fig. and ]. No other systemic or neurological deficit was present.\nA clinical diagnosis of retro bulbar optic neuritis was made on the basis of acute vision loss, pain on eye movement, affected contrast sensitivity and increased latency on VER.\nThe patient was asked to follow up after one week, at that time he complained of increase in ocular pain even at rest and his vision had dropped to 20/200. So to exclude any demyelinating disease magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was advised. The MRI showed a large lobulated lesion, 41 × 66 × 64 mm along the floor of the sella displacing the pituitary superiorly with a suprasellar extension (no post-contrast enhancement). A diagnosis of sphenoid sinus mucocele was made [Fig. and ]. The mass was large enough to be causing indentation of the cavernous sinus. The entire hormonal profile was done and all hormone levels in the blood were normal, including the serum prolactin level.\nThe patient underwent a sub labial transseptal (SLTS) approach for excision of the sphenoid sinus mucocele under general anesthesia within two weeks of diagnosis. At three weeks postoperatively he had recovered normal visual acuity (20/20) but there was residual 0.3 log unit RAPD. The fundus examination was normal with no signs of optic disc pallor. The postoperative MRI done after three weeks showed no residual mucocele [Fig. and ]."
"A hirsute Turkish woman aged 25 applied to our clinic in November 2006 with the history and complaint of the intermittent small amount of leakage from her right axilla during the past year. There was no any history of pilonidal sinus and operation of which at the other sites of her body.\nOn the physical examination, one small sinus sized 2 mm in diameter in her right axilla not including any hair was detected. No discharge was observed in inspection and also palpation. The edematous area of 1 cm in length was recognized around the sinus. Pilonidal sinus was defined at neither the intergluteal sulcus and nor the other regions of her body.\nThe surgical treatment was performed via eliptic skin incision. After application of methylene blue through the orifice of the pilonidal sinus, total excision of the tractus with the neighbouring subcutaneous tissue and the elliptical skin part containing the sinus orifice was performed. Following the total surgical excision, primer suturation of the subcutaneous tissue and the skin were carried out. The tractus was limited only in subcutaneous tissue and the histopathological evaluations confirmed the preassumptive diagnosis of axillary pilonidal sinus. Any perioperative or postoperative complication and recurrence has not been detected during the 36 months follow-up."
"A 25-year-old pregnant woman was evaluated for hypertension. Due to the unsatisfactory blood pressure control she underwent cesarean surgery during the seventh month of pregnancy. After delivery, a CT scan of the abdomen revealed the presence of two abdominal lesions: the first, on the right side, 5.5 cm of maximal diameter, apparently was not clearly separable from the underlying tissues, the inferior cava vein and the aorta; the second, on the left side, 2 cm of maximal diameter, was localized at para-aortic level. A strong uptake at the 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and elevated urinary catecholamine concentrations were consistent with the diagnosis of PGLs. On this basis, the patient underwent surgical resection of the abdominal lesions. The pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of PGL. The genetic analysis revealed the presence of a mutation in the SDHB gene (Figure D). Interestingly, an accurate clinical history revealed that the patient’s mother had been already operated for a PGL. Therefore, mother, brother and daughter of the patient underwent genetic analysis. The first two were positive, while the third one was negative. Anyway, the brother had no apparent disease (Figure D).\nAfter surgery, blood pressure levels progressively improved until a complete normalization. At the last control, 18 months after surgery, urinary metanephrines, and catecholamines as well as blood pressure levels were normal. Later on she moved into another city and was unavailable for follow-up."
"A 25-year-old female received filler injection (Restylane, Q-med, Uppsala, Sweden) on her forehead, glabella, and nose by a non-medical professional. She reported tenderness and redness on the injected areas the day after the injection, which were treated with intravenous antibiotics and hydrocolloid dressings. However, the wound continued to aggravate, and when she was referred on the fifth day after injection, her wound exhibited pus-like discharge, severe inflammation, and a 3×3 cm skin necrosis over her nasal tip, lateral wall, and dorsum. Following her hospital admission, she underwent an empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy and a debridement of necrotic tissues. On the third day of admission, she received adipose-derived stem cell therapy on her nose. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 8. Her wound was completely re-epithelialized 10 days after injection and during 6 months of follow-up; there remained an unnoticeable linear scar on the skin and soft tissue defect site without evidence of asymmetry or disfigurement due to scar contraction on the nasal tip and nostril ()."
"We report the case of a 25-year-old woman who had an HMB in the LV. She visited Kyungpook National University Hospital due to intermittent palpitations and vague chest discomfort. She was a non-alcoholic, had no cardiovascular risk factors, and her family history was unremarkable. Her initial vital signs were stable, and other physical examinations showed non-specific findings except for the irregular heart beat. Her ECG showed an intermittent junctional rhythm (), and the 24-hour Holter ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with intermittent junctional beats (1.9% of all cardiac beats). On 2-dimensional echocardiography, an HMB (3.23 × 10.8 cm) was observed that ran toward the interventricular septum (IVS), across the LV, and divided the LV into apical and basal cavities, which were at the apical one-third of the LV (). Although LV wall thickness showed normal range, flow acceleration was observed between the HMB and IVS and revealed dagger-shaped with a high pressure gradient up to 30 mmHg in continuous wave Doppler examination (). However, LV wall thickness was within the normal range, and apical contraction was good. Circumferential band-like myocardial hypertrophy was observed at the LV apex on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (). Myocardial thinning and prominent trabeculae were evident from proximal to distal on the HMB. However, contractility was normal at the myocardial thinning site, and regional wall motion abnormality was not observed on a cine image. Focal fatty accumulation occurred at the base of the HMB. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis, whereas left ventriculography showed a septation in the apical one-third of the LV (). She was discharged without any medication."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented in urology out-patient department (OPD) with history of intermittent painless hematuria for three weeks. There was no history of fever, trauma, instrumentation, flank pain, ureteric colic or passage of milky white urine. There were no lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). On general examination, there was no hepatosplenomegaly or lymhadenopathy. Local examination including genitalia did not reveal any abnormality. Routine hemogram was normal. The peripheral smear examination did not reveal any parasite. A voided urine sample was collected and sent to the cytopathology laboratory for routine cytological examination. Urine sample was processed by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes. The sediment smears made were stained with May–Grünwald–Giemsa (MGG) and Papanicolaou stains. Smears revealed urothelial cells along with neutrophils, lymphocytes, red blood cells and few microfilariae []. No malignant cells were seen. High power examination of the microfilaria showed a sheathed parasite with central axis of nuclei which ended abruptly before the tip of tail []. With this, characteristic morphology the microfilariae were identified as W. bancrofti.\nSubsequent to the cytological diagnosis patient was treated with 21 days course of diethylcarbazine (DEC) after which he became asymptomatic."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with complaints of pain and redness in the right eye for 1 month. He had taken a short course of oral steroids 15 days ago. He was better while on oral steroids but the symptoms reappeared on discontinuing them. He also gave a history of visualizing a white floater in front of the right eye since a week.\nOn examination, his visual acuity was 6/6 in both the eyes. Ocular examination of the right eye revealed a live, long, white coiled, and highly motile worm in the anterior chamber []. The conjunctiva was slightly congested but rest of the ocular examination was unremarkable. Systemic examination did not reveal any abnormality.\nPatient gave no history of fever, subcutaneous nodules, or any localized swelling in or around the eye. There was no history of travel to endemic areas.\nComplete blood picture and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were within normal limits with no evidence of eosinophilia. Peripheral blood smear was unremarkable, and no microfilariae were seen. Chest x-ray was also normal. Patient was immediately taken up for surgical removal of the worm from the anterior chamber as delay could have lead to posterior migration of the worm. However, in the operating room (OR) no worm could be visualized in the anterior chamber. Henceforth, we performed gonioscopy and a detailed fundus examination under mydriasis but the worm could still not be localized. The patient was then made to lie prone and after half an hour the worm reappeared in the anterior chamber. The pupil was constricted with pilocarpine to prevent the posterior migration of the worm and patient was again taken to the OR.\nA side port incision was made in the nasal quadrant. The worm began to migrate toward the incision with the egress of the aqueous. The intact live worm was recovered from the side port incision itself and preserved in water and sent for identification.\nOn examination, the specimen was found to be an immature female nematode measuring 10 mm, with a maximum width of 290 μm. The worm was rounded at both the ends. The worm had a thick cuticle with longitudinal ridges and circular annulations giving the external cuticle a beaded appearance []. Paired reproductive tubes were visualized at the lower cut end of the worm []. Based on the morphological characteristics, the worm was identified as female adult Dirofialria repens. The images were sent to the Parasitology Division, CDC Atlanta, where the diagnosis was confirmed."
"A 25-year-old male weighing 80 kg, presented with history of occipital headache and vomiting lasting for seven months.Magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed a dermoid cyst in the cisterna magna displacing the fourth ventricle. The midline suboccipital craniotomy and excision of the dermoid cyst were planned in prone position. The past history of any medical/surgical illness was unremarkable. The pre-operative investigations were all within normal limits. In the operating room, after induction ofanesthesia, the patient was positioned prone. After 160 minutes of surgery, the patient developed a sudden flat line on electrocardiogram (ECG) []. The operating surgeon was informed immediately and 100% oxygen was started. The asystole continued for 10 seconds and then reverted back to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously without any intervention. The stoppage of surgery and termination of asystole occurred simultaneously, indicating that brain handling was the cause.After this event,the surgery continued for two more hours and was uneventful.The patient was electively ventilated in view of the intraoperative course and was successfully extubated on the first pre-operative day. One week later, the patient was discharged from the hospital without any further complaints."
"A 25-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted for oligomenorrhea and hirsutism. A physical examination revealed central obesity, a “buffalo hump”, acne, and severe hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey score of 18). After overnight dexamethasone suppression testing (DST), her serum cortisol level was 14.4 µg/dL. She was hospitalized with a presumptive diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.\nHer diurnal cortisol secretion rhythm was found to be impaired; her serum cortisol level at midnight was 27.1 µg/dL. Low-dose DST was also consistent with this diagnosis, with an unsuppressed serum cortisol level of 4.2 µg/dL. Her basal ACTH and cortisol levels were 67 pg/mL and 15.2 µg/dL, respectively.\nWith a refined presumptive diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, we performed overnight high-dose DST with 8 mg dexamethasone. Her serum cortisol level was 10 µg/dL, revealing a lack of suppression. An MRI revealed a 3-mm microadenoma of the hypophysis. However, inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) revealed no substantial gradient in ACTH levels between the center and the periphery (). Thus, a diagnosis of ectopic Cushing's syndrome was proposed.\nUpon CT of the thorax and abdomen, we noted a contrast-enhancing small lesion at the left posterobasal segment (). No involvement was present upon positron emission tomography (PET). SRS revealed a lesion at the left posterobasal segment consistent with the thorax CT, suggesting a bronchial carcinoid tumor ().\nThe patient underwent segmentectomy. An immunohistochemical evaluation revealed positive staining for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and ACTH (). Two weeks after surgery, cortisol was suppressed upon low-dose DST (serum cortisol level, 0.2 µg/dL). After four months of follow up, she had lost 15 kg, her menstrual periods had become regular, and her acne and hirsutism had regressed significantly."
"Primigravid woman, 25-year-old, had her first obstetric transvaginal ultrasonography, in which she was confirmed to have a singleton embryo with the crow-rump length (CRL) of 21 mm, compatible with the 9,0 weeks of gestation. Second ultrasonography, by transvaginal route, was performed on the 11th week that showed a fetus with CRL of 47.0 mm, nuchal translucency of 1.3 mm, hands and feet were poorly defined; at this time EEC syndrome was suspected. The second trimester 2DUS done at 19 weeks confirmed the EEC syndrome. 2DUS was able to demonstrate a fetus with lobster-claw hands (absence of the 2nd and 3rd fingers), left foot with the absence of the 3rd toes and a right foot with syndactyly on the 2nd and 3rd toes, and presence of a cleft lip/palate. The 3DUS, done with a convex volumetric transductor (RAB 4-8L) of Voluson 730 Pro machine (General Electric Medical Systems, Healthcare, Zipf, Austria) in rendering mode, showed the spatial relations of all malformations of the extremity and face, specially the lobster-claw hands [Figures , and ]. The 3DUS was not essential to the EEC syndrome diagnosis, however, it allowed a better depiction of the abnormalities and it was very helpful in explaining the abnormalities to the parents and for genetic counseling. The prenatal care was uneventful, the delivery was done by caesarian section on the 39th week, and the newborn female with weight of 3,150 g and Apgar score 9/9 was born."
"A 25-year-old primigravida with 34 weeks of gestation with univentricular heart and pregnancy-induced hypertension was admitted with preterm labour. She was diagnosed to have univentricular heart at the age of 10 years. Surgery was then proposed but declined by her parents. Despite the severity of the diagnosis she remained asymptomatic and in stable condition. Oxygen saturation varied between being 88% and 92%. Her exercise tolerance was normal during her adolescence. However, since last two years her exercise tolerance was gradually reduced and her activities were minimal. Her first visit to the antenatal clinic was at 10 weeks of amenorrhea and a single intrauterine pregnancy with positive fetal heart beat was confirmed with transvaginal ultrasound. Both she and her husband were informed in detail about the risks of her pregnancy. Following this she had regular obstetric care combined with cardiological assessment, and remained well.\nDetailed anatomy scan at 20 weeks of pregnancy revealed no abnormalities of the fetus. Emphasis was given on the examination of fetal heart but there was no obvious cardiac anomaly present. Repeat scan with Doppler at 28 weeks of pregnancy showed evidence of presystolic notching in bilateral uterine arteries suggestive of early uteroplacental insufficiency. She was diagnosed to have pregnancy-induced hypertension at 31 weeks of gestation and was started on alpha methyldopa.\nDuring pregnancy the hemoglobin level ranged between 12.0 and 14.0 g/dl. Echocardiography revealed single ventricular of LV morphology with moderate valvular pulmonary stenosis. There was normal veno-atrial connection. Two atria were connected via two atrioventricular valves to a single ventricle (of the left type) with an EF of 60%. An anterior rudimentary outlet pouch was giving rise to pulmonary artery, whereas the aorta originated from the single ventricle. Large non-restrictive bulboventricular foramen was present.\nThe pulmonary valve was thickened and other valves were structurally normal. On admission, her BP was 110/86 mmHg. SpO2 measured 92%. Patient presented with advanced preterm labour. A preterm live female, 1200 g infant was born with Apgar scores 8, 9, and 10 at 1, 5, and 10 mins, respectively. The estimated blood loss was 150 ml and the patient was covered with intravenous amoxicillin and gentamicin. Pain relief was achieved with oral diclofenac. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home."
"A 25-year-old male patient visited our clinic for severe snoring. His height was 165 cm, his weight was 120 kg, and he had large palatine tonsils and severe snoring, which sometimes resulted in sleep apnea. His medical check-up, including a chest X-ray, revealed no other problems. In consideration of his sleep apnea symptoms, we planned a bilateral tonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngealplasty (UPPP) under general anesthesia. Intubation was difficult because of his short neck, but general anesthesia with Desfurane gas was stable during surgery. After the patient awoke from general anesthesia, we observed bloody sputum during endotracheal suction. Because we thought it was the result of aspiration during surgery, we removed the endotracheal tube.\nThe patient then developed a severe cough and hemoptysis. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 120/70 mm Hg; temperature 38.4℃; heart rate, 106 beats/min; and respiration rate, 28 breaths/min. The SaO2 level was approximately 74% and the conjunctiva was pale. Heart sounds were normal, but wheezing was heard on chest auscultation. His white blood cell count was 29,190/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) 13.7 g/dl, and platelet count 467,000/mm3. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 10 mg/dl and the C-reactive protein level was increased to 9.2 mg/dl; nevertheless, results of the fluorescent antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) tests were negative, and the levels of C3, C4, and rheumatoid factor were normal. After continuous hemoptysis for several hours, the patient's Hb level decreased rapidly to 6.8 g/dl and his blood SaO2 level decreased gradually.\nAn immediate chest X-ray () and high-resolution computed tomography () of the lower lobe in both lungs showed ground-glass opacity and induration with the appearance of alveolar infiltrates. The tonsillectomy site was clear, and a bronchoscopy was performed to find causative lesions within the trachea, but none were detected (). However, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the right middle lobe bronchus was performed, and the bloody BAL fluid was observed to become redder (). The red blood cell count in the BAL fluid was elevated to 3,052/mm3, and on iron staining, hemosiderin-laden macrophages containing Hb were detected. Thus a definitive diagnosis of DAH was made, after which the patient was treated with an antihemorrhagic agent and antibiotics.\nAfter the massive hemoptysis improved, on plain chest X-ray taken 1 week later, the ground-glass opacity and indurated lesion seen at admission disappeared completely (). The patient was followed up for approximately 1 year, but no recurrence of disease could be detected."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented to the Department of Conservative Dentistry, with pain in the maxillary left first molar for the past two days. Clinical and radiographic findings led to the diagnosis of acute irreversible pulpitis with apical periodontitis. Endodontic treatment was suggested and the procedure was explained to the patient.\nAfter administration of adequate anesthesia endodontic access cavity was prepared. Clinical examination with a DG-16 endodontic explorer (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL) revealed two canal openings in the MB canal. The working length was determined with the help of an apex locator (Tri Auto ZX, J Morita, Tokyo, Japan) and later confirmed using a radiograph. To confirm the extra canal and to check for any aberrations in canal anatomy it was decided to obtain a CBCT image of the tooth. An interim dressing of Cavit (3M, ESPE) was placed and after an informed consent of the patient the CBCT image of the maxilla was performed. The image clearly reveals two canals in the MB orifice of the tooth []. Also a C-shaped orifice was seen in the P canal which helped to plan the correct technique for canal preparation.\nPulp extirpation was completed in all the canals and an interim dressing of Cavit (3M, ESPE) was placed in the canals.\nIn the subsequent check-up the tooth was found to be asymptomatic. Cleaning and shaping of the canals were performed under rubber dam isolation using ProTaper NiTi rotary instruments with a crown down technique till File no. F2. Irrigation of the canals was done after each instrumentation using 2.5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA. Normal saline was used as the final irrigant.\nThe canals were subsequently dried with absorbent paper points and obturated using the F2 ProTaper cone and ZnOE sealer []. The tooth was then restored with a posterior composite Synergy D6 (Coltene, Whaledent). The patient was then advised to do a full coverage restoration."
"A 25-year-old gravida 1, para 1 woman at 38 weeks of gestation was admitted for an elective caesarean section. She had a history of BD for which she was treated with lithium 600mg q12h in the first trimester of pregnancy.\nIt changed to doxepine 10 mg every night and continued until delivery. Other medications were ferrous sulfate and folic acid in usual dosage. The father was 32 years old and there was no consanguinity. There was no familial history of birth defects, any antenatal infection or exposure to any other medications, alcohol, smoking, or X-ray. Pregnancy was uncomplicated and a baby boy (3500g) was born. After 2 to 3 hours of respiratory distress clinical picture and chest radiograph suggested diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. X-ray () showed air-filled intestine herniated into the left chest and the trachea and nasogastric tube displaced to the right side. The operation and repair of his diaphragm was preformed and patient discharged after 12 days.\nTo date, there has been no report of human congenital diaphragmatic hernia after prenatal lithium exposure."
"A 25-year-old previously healthy, non-smoker female was admitted in our hospital with history of fever and productive cough for 1 month and purpuric spots over all limbs for last 2 weeks. There was no history of arthralgia and weight loss. She was not on any medication at the time of admission. Past history and family history were non-contributory. On physical examination, she was alert and well–nourished. Her blood pressure was 110/82 mm Hg, pulse rate 100 beats/min; respiratory rate 20 breaths/ min and oral temperature 38.0°C. She had non-tender, non-palpable purpuric spots over the all 4 limbs []. She had no pallor, sternal tenderness or mucosal bleeding. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Occasional coarse inspiratory crepitations were heard over the left infraclavicular area. Initial investigations revealed Hb- 9.2 g/dL with MCV- 78.9fl, WBC count 10,400/ mm3 with 68% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, and 2% eosinophils. Platelet count was 36,000/mm3 and ESR 90 mm/1st hour. Peripheral blood smear was remarkable for paucity of platelets. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal. Bone marrow biopsy revealed a cellular marrow with normal maturation of myeloid and erythroid series. Megakaryocytes were increased in number with normal morphology. No granuloma was detected. Bone marrow culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Coagulation profile and blood biochemistry were normal. Antinuclear factor and Rheumatoid factor were negative. Serology for an HIV was non-reactive. Sputum smear microscopy was positive for acid fast bacilli (AFB). Chest radiograph revealed an infiltration in the left upper zone \n[].\nFrom these clinical, microbiological, hematological, and radiological findings, she was diagnosed to be having immune thrombocytopenia along with new sputum smear positive pulmonary TB. She was put on WHO Category-I antituberculous drugs with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. High dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion (0.5 g/kg/day) was started on day 1 and continued for total 5 days. The platelet count normalized on 3rd day [] and remained normal during the course of treatment. Sputum smear was negative for AFB at the end of 2nd, 4th and 6th month of chemotherapy. Thrombocytopenia did not recur during follow-up for 1 year after completion of chemotherapy."
"History – This 25 year-old female sustained a close range GSW to the head. She had a short downtime, was intubated at the scene by the emergency medical response team (EMT) with a GCS of 3 and a right blown pupil. She reached our medical center within 30 minutes in stable condition and was rushed to the CT scanner.\nImaging highlights—Head CT demonstrated a bullet trajectory through the right cheek exiting the right parietal skull with no retained bullet fragments with a blow-out fracture of the right parietal skull [Figure and ]. There was intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right temporal lobe with some midline shift and blood in the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle [Figure and ].\nManagement—The patient received intravenous mannitol en route to the hospital. Time from arrival to hospital, transport to the CT scanner, and to the OR was less than 30 minutes. Despite a low GCS with a unilateral blown pupil, several factors were in this patient's favor, namely: a low and lateral trajectory of the bullet; an intact right orbit; no injury to the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) and its branches; no scatter of displaced bone fragments to cause further parenchymal injury; and the function of the blow out fracture acting as a “hinge hemicraniectomy,” thus effectively decompressing the swollen brain []. A wide right-sided decompressive hemicraniectomy (>100 cm2) was performed. The bone was discarded due to an open and contaminated wound. A right temporal lobectomy was performed and an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor was inserted on the left side [].\nClinical outcome—We maintained the patient on mannitol and monitored her ICPs in the intensive care unit (ICU). She did not have any rise in ICP above normal following the operation, was following commands on postoperative day 2, and was subsequently extubated. She initially had a dense left hemiparesis, which improved significantly after a course of rehabilitation. She remains functionally independent 2 years following her injury and is able to walk alone with some circumduction, has some apraxia, but is conversant and able to work."
"A 25-year-old female patient complaining of heavily pigmented gums visited Department of Periodontics, JKK Nattraja Dental College and Hospital, with a request for esthetic treatment of black gums. On examination, her DOPI score was 3 and the patient had a very high smile line []. The patient and the staffs were protected from laser by wearing manufacturer's spectacles. After adequate anesthesia was given, diode laser in contact mode was used. The ablation was operated using a hand piece with fiber optic filament, 320 μm in diameter set at 0.8 W. The procedure was performed in a contact mode in cervico-apical direction on all pigmented areas []. No pain or bleeding complications were observed during and after the procedure. One day postoperatively, it revealed no pain or discomfort []. The ablated wound healed completely in 1 week. Three months after the ablation, the gingiva was generalized pink in color and healthy in appearance []."
"A 25-year-old female presented with pain abdomen in the right iliac fossa. On examination, there was a mass in the right iliac fossa near the umbilicus, measuring 7 × 6 cm, and was firm to hard in consistency. Clinically, ilieocecal kochs or carcinoma cecum was suspected. Ultrasonography showed bilateral solid adnexal mass, suspected to be an ovarian tumor.\nFNAC of the right iliac fossa mass was performed. The smears showed moderately cellular aspirate comprising large number of tumor cells arranged singly and in loose clusters with granular eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei []. Background showed plenty of sarcoid-like granulomas, epithelioid cells, few lymphocytes and plasma cells [, inset]. Ziehl Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli was negative. A diagnosis of germ cell tumor of the ovary, possibly dysgerminoma, with plenty of sarcoid-like granulomas was offered.\nTotal abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salphingoophorectomy was performed and the specimen was sent for histopathological examination. Grossly, bilateral ovarian masses were identified with the right- and left-sided masses measuring 8 × 6 × 3.5 cm and 7 × 5 × 2 cm, respectively. External surface of both the masses was nodular with cerebriform appearance, and the cut surface was solid, lobulated, grey white with yellowish areas. Right-sided mass showed areas of cystic and mucoid degeneration.\nMicroscopic examination confirmed the presence of dysgerminoma component with plenty of sarcoid-like granulomas in the stroma and revealed the presence of an additional minor component of yolk sac tumor involving both the ovaries []. Periodic acid Schiff stain showed both intracytoplasmic and extracellular hyaline droplets. A final diagnosis of mixed germ cell tumor with plenty of sarcoid-like granulomas was made."
"The first offspring, a female, 25 years old, reported eight surgeries on her face because of the involvement of her left facial nerve; thus, she had facial asymmetry and a lowered left ear. She had several neurofibromas and Café-au-lait pigmentations on her body. She was the only member of her family who had oral manifestation of NF1. During oral examination, we saw three new formations of neurofibromatic masses on the left side of her palate and sublingual area [Figures –]."
"A 25-year-old female reported with the chief complaint of bleeding gums during tooth brushing since six months []. General physical examination revealed that the patient was of a short stature and had a low hairline at the back of the neck. Medical history revealed that the patient had been recently diagnosed with TS. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed underdeveloped uterus on both the right and left sides []. No other systemic abnormalities were reported. Intraoral examination revealed high-arch palate; rotated maxillary right lateral incisor (tooth 12); a missing mandibular right first molar (tooth 46); lower anterior crowding with grade I mobility; and thinned enamel on the labial surface of maxillary teeth. Severe marginal and papillary gingival inflammation was seen associated with abundant deposits of plaque and calculus []. Generalized Miller's class I recession was observed. Radiographically, vertical bone loss extending upto half of the root length on the distal aspect of tooth 41; mesial aspect of tooth 22; and on both the mesial and distal aspects of tooth 21 was observed. A mild degree of horizontal bone loss was also observed in relation to teeth 16, 25, 26, 45, and 46 []."
"A 25-year-old Chinese lady presented with gradual hair loss over one year, losing more than 100 strands per day. Her general health was good and menstrual cycles were regular. Thyroid function test, ferritin and hemoglobin levels were normal.\nOn examination, there was minimal diffuse sparsity of the scalp. Notably, there were hair casts along the hair shaft in a beaded fashion. Hair pull test was negative.\nCulture of the hair casts yielded P. acnes.\nShe was initially prescribed minoxidil 2% lotion twice daily to the scalp, with no improvement of hair loss. She was also treated with selenium sulfide shampoo, betamethasone scalp lotion, and ketoconazole shampoo, with no improvement to the hair casts. She was subsequently prescribed EES 400 mg twice daily with clearance of hair casts after a four-week course. However, hair casts recurred a month after EES was stopped. A repeat course of EES for four weeks resulted in reduction of hair casts again. The patient also reported that hair loss numbers had also decreased while on the oral antibiotic."
"A 25-year-old Chinese lady presented with one year of worsening “dandruff” and increased hair loss over the last six months. She was noted to have hair casts and mild diffuse sparsity of her hair []. Hair pull test was also positive. A scalp biopsy was performed, which showed intact follicular units with minimal inflammation, and Gram-positive, Giemsa-positive cocci in the follicular canals, consistent with P. acnes [Figure –]. One fungal culture yielded Microsporum canis, which was likely a contaminant as fungal elements were not seen on scalp biopsy or hair microscopy, and all subsequent fungal cultures were negative without specific anti-fungal therapy.\nShe was prescribed EES, and her hair casts and alopecia resolved in four months. Two months after cessation of antibiotics, the hair casts recurred, and this was again successfully treated within 1 month of restarting EES."
"A 25 year old female patient presented with asymptomatic skin colored papules over the face and genitals [] for the past 10 years. The lesions commenced over the face and gradually appeared over the genitalia. Patient had history of multiple topical applications without any significant response. Clinical examination revealed multiple discrete skin-colored papules just above the upper lip, malar area and both labia majora. Biopsy from a papule over genitalia showed numerous small ducts lined by two rows of flat epithelial cells. Some ducts possessed small comma like tails of epithelial cells giving a tadpole-like appearance. In addition, there were solid strands of basophilic epithelial cells. Few cystic ductal lumina filled with keratin were also seen near the epidermis []. The above clinical and histopathological picture clinched the diagnosis of syringoma."
"A 25 year-old male patient was referred our outpatient clinic with complaints of pruritic skin lesions which started approximately 7 days ago. The examination of the patient revealed urticarial plaques in several sizes through-out his body and a solitary thyroid nodule with a diameter of 1~1.5 cm. Other findings were normal. Upon diagnosis of acute urticaria without any identifiable cause, desloratadine tablets (10 mg/day, per os) were started.\nLaboratory investigations of the patient were normal except for high levels of thyroid autoantibodies (anti-thyroid peroxidase, 55 IU/ml, anti-thyroglobuline: 300 IU/ml). Thyroid ultrasonography detected a hypoechoic nodule with a diameter of 10 mm. Cytological examination of the biopsy specimen taken from the thyroid nodule with fine-needle aspiration was reported as 'Thyroid Papillary Carcinoma'.\nA dose of 60 mg of prednisolone was added to the treatment of the patient who was clinically nonresponsive despite doubling of an antihistamine dose. Nevertheless, this five-day treatment did not result in any benefits.\nThe patient underwent total thyroidectomy because of the papillary thyroid carcinoma and all other issues disappeared spontaneously after the second day of the post-operative period; there have been no urticarial symptoms in the patient 9th months after surgery."
"The patient, a 25-year-old Japanese woman, the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents, was born after 39 weeks of gestation with no prenatal or perinatal problems. Her early developmental milestones were normal, except for two episodes of febrile seizures at 1 year of age, which never recurred. From the age of three, her food intake was relatively small, and malnutrition delayed her physical growth, but her mental development was normal. From the age of nine, she suffered from episodic vomiting after eating, which caused anorexia. At the age of 11, she was referred to our hospital for further investigation of progressive weight loss (−1.4 kg/year). Her height was 123 cm (−3.0 SD) and she weighed 18.6 kg (−2.5 SD). She had normal intelligence and no neurological deficits, except for episodic postprandial vomiting. Detailed physical investigations showed no significant abnormalities, except for scoliosis. Gastrointestinal, metabolic, endocrinological and psychological disorders were ruled out. No neurophysiological examinations were performed, although, brain MRI revealed a 7-mm-sized lesion in the posterior dorsal portion of the cervicomedullary junction, which was enhanced with Gd-DTPA (Fig. A). Signal changes were also detected bilaterally in the dentate nuclei without enhancement. No other signal abnormalities were noted. During follow-up on MRIs, taken twice a year, the enhancement of the lesion disappeared after 2 years, although the plaque remained. Her episodic vomiting also vanished almost simultaneously. Her growth stopped at the age of 17. At age 25, she is frail 140 cm/33.4 kg with scoliosis. She has normal intelligence and is asymptomatic. A tiny plaque without enhancement, the same size as before, is still visible in the dorsal part of medulla oblongata (Fig. C), although cervicomedullary atrophy without a signal change has advanced (Fig. B).\nSequencing of the GFAP gene with informed consent revealed a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 5 (c.827G>T), causing a change of arginine to leucine at amino acid position 276 (p.R276L). The mutation was not found in her mother. The father, who died in traffic accident in his forties, could not be investigated. This mutation has already been described as responsible for pathologically proven hereditary [] and sporadic [] cases of adult-onset AxD. According to an interview, there was no relationship between the present patient and the families previously reported, although they originated from the same region of Japan."
"A 25-year-old gentleman reported to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with a chief complaint of inability to open the mouth, pain, and swelling in relation to the lower jaw and neck since a day. On physical examination, he had respiratory distress and was toxic in appearance and his vital signs were monitored immediately. His temperature was 101.8°F with a pulse rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. Mouth opening was limited to 1.5 cm (interincisal distance) and revealed grossly decayed lower right second molar tooth with drainage of pus. Extra-oral swelling was indurated, nonfluctuant with bilateral involvement of the submandibular and sublingual glands []. An immediate diagnosis of Ludwig's angina was made, and the patient was posted for surgical decompression under general anesthesia. However, elective tracheostomy was planned for airway maintenance with the help of an otolaryngologist. The blood report was normal except for raise in ESR, eosinophilia. Elective tracheostomy was done under local anesthesia, airway secured and general anesthesia was provided. Separate stab incisions was made in relation to the submandibular space bilaterally and submental space. A sinus forceps was introduced to open up the tissue spaces and pus was drained. The wound was irrigated with normal saline, and a separate tube drain was placed and secured to the skin with silk sutures []. Intravenous administration of cefotaxime 1 g Bd, gentamycin 80 mg Bd, metrogyl 500 mg, Tid were given for 5 days with a tapering dose of decadran 8–4 mg Bd for first two postoperative days. Postoperative irrigation was done through the drain which was removed after 36 h along with the infected tooth. Tracheostomy tube care was taken in the postoperative period, and the skin was strapped on the fifth postoperative day after the removal of the tracheostomy tube. Patient recovery was satisfactory."
"A 25 year old male underwent bilateral LASIK in August 2010 at a private center. Six days postoperatively the patient developed bilateral diffuse lamellar keratitis. Visual acuity with correction (decimal notation) was 0.05 in the right eye and 0.2 in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination was as following:\nMissing corneal flap, severe stromal corneal haze and edema [].\nEdema of the corneal epithelial flap, anterior stromal infiltrates and a button hole in the flap just below the visual axis.\nCSLT (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph Rostock Corneal Module; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg Germany) in both eyes revealed stromal cyst-like structures [] suggestive of Acanthamoeba keratitis. Some of the cysts had characteristic double-walled structures []. The patient was put on triple topical anti-Acanthamoeba medication (propamidine hydrochloride 0.1%, polyhexamethylene biguanide 0.02% and chlorhexidine 0.02%, every 2 hours; the drops were obtained from Moorfields Eye Hospital, United Kingdom) and systemic ketoconazole (200 mg daily). Repeat CSLT at 4 months showed disappearance of the Acanthamoeba cysts and the patient was maintained on topical propamidine, twice daily for 3 months. At 9 months follow up the patient had gained vision to 1.0 with correction in both eyes."
"A 25-year-old lady presented to us with complaints of shortening of fingers of the hands, deformity of nails and yellowish papules in the hands and forearms for 21 years. The patient's complaints started early in childhood, with asymptomatic shortening of terminal phalanges in a couple of fingers of insidious onset that gradually involved all fingers of the hands. However, the toes remained unaffected []. At almost the same time, the patient started developing asymptomatic papules in the hands. At presentation, the patient had non-follicular yellowish papules in the fingers, hands and elbow extensors, mostly discrete but some of them coalescing to form a confluent appearance []. The terminal phalanges were extremely short, with a relative broadened appearance. The patient's nails resembled racket nails. The patient had no history of Raynaud's phenomena, any bleeding disorders, occupational exposure to vinyl chloride gas and hobby of playing guitar or any other musical instruments or any other recurrent trauma. Menstrual history was normal. Detailed cutaneous and systemic examination failed to detect palmoplantar keratoderma, hirsuitism, dental abnormality or any other musculoskeletal abnormality.\nRoutine investigations including blood counts, hepatic and renal function tests, calcium level and parathyroid hormone status and ultrasonography of the abdomen were within normal limits. Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) were negative. Roentgenogram of the hands showed destructive osteolytic changes in the terminal phalanges of all 10 fingers []. A biopsy for histopathology was taken from the yellowish papule revealing hyperkeratosis, focal parakeratosis and acanthosis of epidermis. The dermis was thickened, with abundant collagen bundles surrounding the eccrine coils. The hypodermis was characterized by loss of adipocytes and septal thickening associated thickened eosinophilic collagen bundles []. Histopathology of the papules resembled sclerodematous changes. Correlating clinical findings with laboratory evidence finally, we could diagnose the case as an idiopathic non-familial variety of acro-osteolysis."
"A 25-year-old male presented with swelling over face since one day. There were similar episodes since two years with gradual subsidence of swelling without any treatment. Patient also gave the history of minor trauma prior to each episode. However; there was no history of wheals, associated systemic complaints, drug intake, food allergy, and similar complaints in family.\nOn cutaneous examination, there was edema of eyelids, left cheek, and lips. Based on the cutaneous finding, angioneurotic edema was suspected and patient was treated in emergency department with inj. hydrocortisone, inj. epinephrine, and inj. chlorpheniramine without any significant outcome. Swelling gradually subsided over a period of three days [Figures and ].\nLaboratory investigations including complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, urine examination, antinuclear antibody test, chest X-ray, and X-ray of paranasal sinuses were all within normal limit. Considering the history of repeated episodes of angioedema without wheals without any precipitating factor with no response to usual line of management special investigations like complement C4 and C1 esterase inhibitor levels were done. Complement C4 and C1 esterase inhibitor levels were 1.44 mg /dl (N 10 -40 mg/dl) and 38 mg /L (N 275 – 400 mg/L), respectively, suggested the diagnosis of HAE (type 1). C1q level was not done because of unavailability of the test in India.\nPatient was started on stanozolol 2 mg thrice a day with no recurrence in one year of follow-up."
"A 25-year-old female patient was referred for refractive surgery. Corneal imaging revealed no contraindication for surgery. However, having a high cup/disc (C/D) ratio, the patient was referred to a glaucoma unit for further evaluation and whether the cornea surgeon can proceed with refractive surgery.\nsummarizes the results of her baseline ophthalmologic examination. During a two-year follow-up period, the patient was monitored and various imaging studies were performed; intraocular pressure (IOP) was never increased and daytime IOP always remained under 18 mmHg at different hours. Optic nerve head appearance at baseline and final visits, which were carried out within a two-year interval, are presented in .\nBaseline and final visual field examinations were likewise performed within a two-year interval and are presented in and , respectively.\nThe patient underwent optic nerve head imaging studies using Heidelberg retinal tomography (HRT) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) (, and ).\nHerein we present the opinions of five glaucoma specialists regarding this case; these experts will address the following questions:\nDo you consider this patient a case of glaucoma?\nWould you recommend laser refractive surgery for the patient?"
"A 25 year-old male was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital following a car accident (1st Surgical Department, General Regional Hospital “George Papanikolaou”, Thessaloniki, Greece, 2006). The patient, who was intubated, suffered from major trauma including an open fracture of the left tibia, an open fracture of the right radius and ulna, a right temporo-occipital subdural hematoma, fractures of the lower left ribs and splenic rupture. Splenectomy and surgical management of the fractures and the subdural hematoma were performed. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Six days later, acalculous cholecystitis was observed and open cholecystostomy was therefore conducted. On the 12th postoperative day, a tracheostomy was performed. A persistent fever and leukocytosis of unknown primary origin, at the 20th postoperative day, led to an abdominal CT scan which was normal except for the IHO of the parietal peritoneum. As the finding was incidental and was asymptomatic, the patient was managed conservatively. Fifty three days after the accident, the patient developed an esophagotracheal fistula and was therefore subjected to a gastrostomy. Because of the IHO of the parietal peritoneum, the gastrostomy was performed surgically. During the laparotomy, the IHO of the parietal peritoneum of the midline was observed and excised. Histopathological examination demonstrated mature osseous tissue (both solid and cancellous) and hyaloids cartilage and confirmed the diagnosis (). Two months after the gastrostomy, the patient, still having the gastrostomy, underwent another abdominal CT scan because of vague abdominal pain. The CT scan demonstrated recurrence of the ossification of the parietal peritoneum (). The patient was treated conservatively. Six years after the accident, the patient is alive and well while the IHO of the peritoneum is stable in size and does not cause any symptoms."
"A 25 year old male, farmer by occupation, met with an accident when he was riding a bicycle and was hit by a fast moving truck. He was brought to the emergency in an unconscious state. Left ear bleed was present. There was no history of nose bleed, seizure, or cerebrospinal fluid leak. There was no history of significant illness, substance abuse, or any history suggestive of any bleeding disorder. Patient was a non-diabetic non-hypertensive. Prior to the accident, he was not on any medication. On examination, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was E1V1M2 Pupils were 2 mm bilaterally, reacting to light. There was right hemiplegia. Right sided pneumothorax was present for which a tube thoracostomy was done. The pulse and blood pressure was normal. Patient was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. A plain Computerized Tomogram (CT) showed Intracerebral bleed [] in the basal ganglia involving the corona radiata on the right (approximately 18 mm by 11 mm) and left (approximately 30 mm by 21 mm). There was small amount of blood in the right frontoparietal cortex. Sulcal spaces and basal cisterns were effaced. There was fracture of left temporal bone [] and blood in the left mastoid, middle ear, sphenoid and bilateral ethmoidal sinus. All blood parameters and radiology including clotting profile were within normal limits. Patient was shifted to neurosurgical ICU and decongestants in the form of frusemide and 20% mannitol were given. Antibiotics and phenytoin sodium was also given. He was continued on ventilatory support and subsequently tracheostomized on day 5. Nasogastric feed was also started gradually. A Gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging study (MRI) done on day 7 of injury did not reveal any vascular lesion [Figure –]. The hematomas were resolving and edema was decreasing. Non-contrast CT done after 35 days showed complete resolution of the hematoma []. His motor score gradually improved to withdrawal response (M4) and eye opening was spontaneous (E4) by the 8th day of injury. Phenytoin was continued. The chest tube was removed after confirming lung expansion on chest radiograph. Supportive care was given and patient was weaned off the ventilator. He had spontaneous eye opening and was maintaining eye contact. On follow-up, patient had regained consciousness and obeyed verbal commands. He still had dysphasia with right spastic hemi paresis."
"The 25-year-old male patient diagnosed with BD three years ago was admitted to our clinic with complaints of recurrent throbbing headache accompanied by nausea and vomiting for four months. The neurological examination of the patient was normal. On the Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a lesion that was thought to be accordant with choroiditis or a tumor with a diameter of one cm was detected near the left lateral ventricle posterior horn and near the left temporal lobe uncus (). Lumbar punction (LP) could not performed because the patient did not give permission for an LP. The patient was then discharged. On the basis of the intracranial mass (malignancy?) diagnosis, a tumor excision was made on the patient who applied at another center. The pathological examination was consistent with a definite loss of myelin in the lesion via the immuno-histochemical method. Finally, it was commented as having a demyelinating non-tumoural etiology. After the operation, intensive oedema areas were observed in the left temporo-parietal, left pons hemisphere, and left mesencephalic hemisphere on the cranial MRI (). Right hemiparesis and motor aphasia were observed and three weeks later the patient suffered from secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Triple antiepileptic and 1 gr/day methyl prednisolone were given to the patient who suffered persistent seizures and lethargy. Colchicine treatment was administered for BD. The patient's seizures were kept partially under control with this treatment, and he was discharged with the recommendation of coming to the controls."
"This patient was a 25-year-old single male teacher presented with from middle socioeconomic status and rural background. Patient complained of bodily weakness, pains and aches all over the body, lack of concentration, nocturnal emissions and excessive masturbation. He reported premature ejaculation since last 1 year. He was anxious about performing adequately sexually after getting married. He attributed all these symptoms to loss of semen (‘vital energy’, as considered by him). The components of CBT module draft was applied on this patient. Results [] indicated clinically significant improvement in sexual knowledge, somatic and depressive symptoms. However, there were no clinically significant improvements on the other measures.\nIt was also understood that sex education alone is not sufficient. The patient could intellectually understand that loss of semen was harmless. However, his beliefs about loss of semen were triggered again when he experienced pain and weakness the next time semen was lost through either masturbation or nocturnal emissions. It was, then, when the importance of cognitive processes and factors (especially selective attention to symptoms) was realized. It was found that the core belief of the patient was related to the cultural concept of ‘masculinity’. His idea was that if a person was not ‘sexually adequate’; he was not a ‘real man’. All the depressive cognitions and lack of self-esteem was intrinsically related to this concept. The importance of addressing this core belief to bring about any therapeutic change was realized. It was thus decided to address the core schema systematically and vigorously related to masculinity to effect any change in subsequent patients. With these insights, it was decided that emphasis would be given to cognitive restructuring, addressing and modification of cognitive errors in the subsequent patients. There have been no studies earlier, which had utilized cognitive restructuring in the management of patients with Dhat syndrome.[]"
"This patient was a 25-year-old single male, employed as an engineer, from middle socioeconomic status and urban background. He had presented with complaints of inferiority feelings, anxiety in social situations, inability to concentrate on work, sweating, and dry mouth. He attributed these symptoms to loss of semen through excessive masturbation. He felt that others came to know that he engaged in masturbation by looking at his ‘weak body’. He reported intense guilt and had stopped going for social functions. Results after application of the module indicated clinically significant improvement on most of the domains []. In this patient, though some amount of anxiety was related to Dhat syndrome itself, it was found that his basic anxious temperament was also playing a large role. Cognitive restructuring was helpful in tackling this. Managing the basic anxiety remained the mainstay in this patient. The predisposing anxiety might have increased the likelihood of him having reacted to the cultural beliefs in a neurotic way, which has been one of the proposed pathways of development of Dhat syndrome.[]"
"A 25 year old woman came with complaints of nodular lesion left side abdomen for 5 to 7 years []. It was associated with pain and discharge for 3-4 days.\nLesion was slowly progressive. She had not taken any treatment for this.\nDermatological examination showed large nodular lesion of size 5 cm in diameter left side abdomen, not adherent to the deeper structures. We decided to rule out Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and a biopsy was done. It showed calcified lesion with no evidence of malignancy.\nLesion was excised and the whole specimen was again sent for histopathology which showed calcified worm."
"A 25-year-old male without a history of smoking presented with a 1-week history of cough and right-sided back pain when coughing. The patient had a history of one hospital admission due to pneumonia approximately ten years prior to the current presentation and complained of intermittent cough over the intervening ten years.\nA physical examination identified decreased breathing sounds over the right lower lung without other findings. A complete blood count test, liver function test and urine analysis were normal. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 61 mm/hr and his high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was 3.86 mg/dL. Chest radiography showed an abnormal mass-like shadow in the right lower lung (). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an 11 cm solid, cystic mixed mass in the right lower lobe without a feeding vessel from the descending aorta (). Bronchoscopy disclosed purulent secretion from the posterior basal segmental bronchus of the right lower lobe. A pulmonary function test was normal.\nSubsequently, the patient underwent a right lower lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. A macroscopic examination showed a massive cavitation with multiloculated cysts of varying size within the lesion and pleural fibrosis (). Microscopically, the specimen consisted of multiple cysts () which were lined by cuboidal-to-ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and some cysts contained extensive secondary inflammation (). These histological features were consistent with typical type I CCAM. In addition, a microscopic examination revealed a noticeable caseous granulomatous inflammation in the cyst walls (). The necrotic center was surrounded by epithelioid histiocytes and then by a rim of lymphocytes (). Forty colony forming units of non-tuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM) were isolated from a bronchial wash specimen. Furthermore, resected lung tissue homogenates were positive for MAC by real-time polymerase chain reaction (). The postoperative course was uneventful without anti-mycobacterial treatment. Two years after surgery, chest radiography showed a well-expanded right lung without lesions."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with a chief complaint of an unattractive smile because of the presence of a white spot lesion (). The medical history of the patient was non-contributory. Intraoral examination showed that a single white spot lesion was present on the incisal third of the maxillary left central incisor. The patient's oral hygiene index was scored as 0. Multiple gingival recessions and cervical abrasions were detected and cold sensitivity was observed on the cervical region of the maxillary central incisors.\nThe patient rejected all treatment options requiring tooth preparation. After discussing with the patient, tooth jewelry was considered as a treatment option. We explained that the tooth jewelry would have a masking effect, didn't need any tooth preparation, and could be removed at any time. Tooth jewelry (Shine, Vertriebsges, Innsbruck, Austria) was bonded to the distal part of the maxillary left central incisor following same procedure shown in the first case (). Cautions were given to the patient that debonding should be done only in a dental clinic. After 4 months, the patient came for removal of the tooth jewelry. The tooth jewelry was maintained well without marginal discoloration. After rubber dam isolation, tooth jewelry was debonded safely using an ultrasonic scaler, followed by removal of remaining resin with a low-speed finishing carbide bur."
"A 25-year-old male presented with four days of progressive weakness and muscle pain. Initially he noticed myalgias in his chest and biceps. Two days prior to presentation he noticed forearm pain and hand weakness. One day prior to presentation he noticed lower extremity weakness and pain, limiting his ability to ambulate. Two weeks prior to presentation he had been prescribed amoxicillin for a sore throat and fever, however he was not tested for streptococcus or influenza at that time. He denied prior medical problems, trauma, routine medication use or recent strenuous exercise.\nVital signs and general examination were normal. He had no rashes or joint pain. Bilateral arm and forearm muscles were tight and tender. Strength was decreased bilaterally in upper and lower extremities, including wrist extension and flexion (4/5), grip strength (4-/5), hip flexion (3/5), hip extension (5-/5), knee flexion (4-/5) and knee extension (5-/5). His reflexes and sensation were normal.\nLaboratory values were generally unremarkable with the exception of a CK of 3,575 ng/ml. Pertinent negative virologic tests included CSF bacterial culture, HIV, Influenza A by DFA, Influenza B by DFA, and CSF Influenza by PCR. An MRI of the cervical spine was normal.\nHe was given IV fluids and ibuprofen. The day following presentation his weakness continued to progress and involved truncal weakness. Needle EMG study (distal, proximal and paraspinal muscles) showed only one run of positive waves in the thoracic paraspinal muscles. Two days after presentation he had dramatic improvement. His strength returned to 5/5 except in his left upper extremity strength, which improved to 4+/5 in wrist flexion, wrist extension and finger extension. The swelling and tenderness also improved. His CK decreased to 975 ng/ml and serum creatinine remained stable and within normal limits."
"A 25- year old female was presented with complex partial seizure for three months. She had bifrontal headache for last two months which was moderate in intensity and aggravated in the early morning hours. Headache was often associated with vomiting, however vomiting did not relieve headache.\nThe patient was conscious and oriented with time, place, and person. There was no sensory or motor deficit. All cranial nerves were normal. There was bilateral early papilloedema. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of head showed- left temporal cystic mass without any enhancing area with perifocal oedema. The cyst had attenuation value of 7 hounsefield unit [].\nLeft temporal craniotomy was done. After corticectomy, the dilated left temporal horn was opened, which led the clear fluid to come out under pressure. There was a well defined whitish cyst of 2.5cm × 2 cm size present at trigone and was removed in without rupture []."
"A 25-year-old male from Guntur District of Andhra Pradesh presented to the Tuberculosis and Chest department of NRI General Hospital, Chinakakani with complaints of productive cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, and dyspnoea for the last four months. There was history of occasional fever but no weight loss. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi on auscultation.\nBlood picture showed leucocytosis with eosinophilic preponderance. Routine examination of blood and urine disclosed normal findings and the sputum was repeatedly negative for acid-fast bacilli. Computed tomography (CT) scan impression was a 6×6.9×5.9 cm hypodense lesion in the posterior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung with minimal adjacent loculated effusion-probably lung abscess []. Ultrasound guided aspiration was done and fluid analysis revealed viable scoleces [].\nA large unilocular hydatid cyst was removed from the right lung through a right thoracotomy. Oral albendazole 400 mg b.i.d. was given for 5 days preoperatively and 4 weeks post operatively."
"This 25-year-old lady,hailing from a rural area of West Bengal, presented to us with history of increased statural growth and enlarged body parts noticed since the age of 14 years, primary amenorrhea, and frontal headache for the last 2 years. She has also been suffering from non-inflammatory low back pain with progressive kyphosis and pain in the knees, ankles and elbows for the last 5 years. At the time of presentation, she was unable to walk without assistance. There was no history of visual disturbance, vomiting, galactorrhoea, cold intolerance, acroparaesthesia, overt gastrointestinal bleeding, or snoring. She had no siblings. There was no history of similar illness in the family.\nOn examination, vitals were stable with normal blood pressure. Height was 221 cm; weight was 138 kg with BMI of 28. There was coarsening of facial features along with frontal bossing and prognathism. She had large hands and feet [Figures –]. Her voice was deep. There was a small goitre. Patient could not stand straight due to severe kyphosis and osteoarthritis of knees with limited joint mobility. Osteoarthritic changes were also present in the small joints of the hand. Confrontation perimetry suggested bitemporal hemianopia. There was no visceromegaly. Breast was Tanner stage 1, and there was no axillary or pubic hair.\nLaboratory investigation showed OGTT of 136 mg/dl with normal liver and renal function test. Serum IGF1 was 703 ng/ml with all glucose suppressed GH values of >40 ng/ml. Prolactin was 174 ng/ml. Basal cortisol and thyroid profile were normal. Pooled sera showedFSH of 1.05 and LH of 0.272 mIU/ml. Serum calcium, and phosphorus were normal. iPTH was 16.7 pg/ml. Hemoglobin was 11.1 g/dl. Computed tomographyscan of brain showed large pituitary macroadenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not be done as the patient could not be negotiated within the MRI machine. Automated perimetry confirmed bitemporal hemianopia. ultrasound (USG) showed small, prepubertaluterine volume (1.5 ml). X-rays showed osteoarthritic changes of spine, knees, and small joints of the hand. Epiphyses were seen to be fused in X-rays of hands and knees.\nA diagnosis of gigantism due to GH secreting pituitary macroadenoma with hypogonadotrophichypogonadism was made. Debulkingpituitary surgery followed by somatostatinanalogue therapy with gonadal steroid replacement had been planned, but the patient refused further treatment."
"A 25-year-old female reported to the dental clinic with complaint of decayed tooth in the left back region of the lower jaw. On examination an elevation on the labial aspect of crown of the maxillary right permanent central incisor was noticed. The elevation was broader at the cervical area and gradually tapered toward the incisal edge to give a ridge-like appearance. The cervical area had light brown discoloration []. No abnormalities were noticed on the palatal surface of the tooth. A midline diastema existed between the two central incisors. The periapical area appeared to be normal. Normal responses were obtained on the pulp testing procedure. Intraoral periapical radiograph of the area revealed V-shaped radiopacity in relation to the coronal aspect of maxillary right central incisor, extending 1 mm below the incisal edge to the cementoenamel junction. The radiopacity of the V-shaped area was comparable to that of enamel. No pulpal or canal changes were observed. No changes in the periapical area were noticed []. Based on these clinical and radiological features diagnosis of facial talon cusp was made. A thorough oral prophylaxis was performed and the decayed molar was restored. As the patient had no complaints with the abnormal tooth (with facial talon) she was kept on a yearly periodic recall."
"A 25 year old nonsmoker and non alcohalic male laborer suffered inhalation injury to phosgene gas after accidental leakage while working in a pesticide manufacturing factory. Immediately after exposure he experienced lacrimation, nausea, and dry cough with burning sensation in his mouth and throat. After six hours of exposure he developed breathlessness. The patient did not complain of chest pain, hemoptysis orthopnoea or Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnoea. Initially he was admitted to the nearby hospital and managed conservatively. However within 24 hrs his condition worsened and he developed severe respiratory distress thus he was referred to our hospital, a tertiary care referral center for respiratory and intensive care. At the time of admission he was conscious and oriented to time place and person. He was febrile having temperature of 100 F, tachycardia of 130/min and tachyopnea of 36/min. using accessory muscle of respiration. His SpO2 was 80% without oxygen. On chest auscultation bilateral coarse crepitations were present. His cardiovascular and abdominal examination did not reveal any abnormality. His laboratory investigation revealed total leukocyte count 24000/cmm, with majority of polymorphs. His biochemical, renal and hepatic parameters were within normal limits. His X-ray chest was suggestive of bilateral hilar fluffy shadow characteristic batwing appearance []. He was given high flow oxygen therapy with face mask. After 30 minutes arterial blood gas analysis showed acidemia and hypoxia. Noninvasive ventilation was tried but within an hour shifted to invasive ventilatory support. Antibiotic therapy in the form of third generation cephalosporin was started prophylacticaly along with supportive therapy. He remained hemodynamic stable throughout ICU stay. His Endotracheal aspirate culture was sent immediately after intubation and after 48 hours of ventilatory support. Both the culture reports were sterile. He gradually improved with treatment and was successfully weaned off from ventilator on 6th day of ICU stay. He was shifted to general ward on 8th day and was discharged from the hospital on 10th day. He regularly came in follow up every week and recovered completely after 6 weeks."
"A 25-year-old man who received telbivudine therapy for chronic hepatitis B presented with progressive generalized weakness and difficulty exercising. He was diagnosed with CHB 4 years ago, and took lamivudine at first, but he changed to combination therapy of 600 mg of telbivudine once daily for 13 months and 10 mg of adefovir once to control HBV activation and lamivudine resistance. At 12 months after starting treatment, the HBV DNA level decreased to the undetectable range, and the elevated serum AST and ALT levels also decreased along with viral stabilization. However, the patient began to suffer from generalized weakness and difficult exercising since about 2 years after the treatment. He did not have dysphagia, cramps, or sensory symptoms and did not exhibit motor weakness. Laboratory analyses showed AST of 54 IU/L, ALT of 57 IU/L, total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, BUN of 13.4 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of 1.15 mg/dL, and serum CK was elevated up to 2,992 IU/L. In this case, we did not conduct EMG. These two patients were siblings and they started taking telbivudine at the same time. Also, his symptoms were similar to those of his brother. His brother was diagnosed telbivudine-induced myopathy in advance. He visited the department of neurology and was diagnosed with toxic myopathy. For these reasons, we empirically diagnosed this patient with telbivudine-induced myopathy and decided to switch telbivudine to entecavir, so he received combination therapy with 0.5 mg of entecavir and 10 mg of adefovir. Two months after telbivudine withdrawal, he revisited our clinic and his laboratory test showed decreased CK level to the normal range of 157 IU/L. Also, his clinical symptoms of muscle weakness have improved."
"A 25-year-old male was working with braided cable under tension at a local construction site when the cable, approximately 2 inches in diameter, snapped without warning and perforated his right cheek, penetrating his right temporal and right parietal lobe. After shortening the cable to 1.5 feet at the construction site, emergency medical services brought the patient to our Level I trauma center. He was transported wearing a cervical spine collar in the sitting position. On arrival, he was awake and alert, unable to speak, and mildly agitated. His initial vital signs were a blood pressure of 159/67 mmHg, heart rate of 54 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a pulse oximetry reading of 97% on 15 liters of oxygen. The remainder of his primary and secondary surveys revealed no further injuries.\nBecause of the position of the cable through his jaw and upward into his brain, the patient was unable to open his mouth more than two centimeters. In the trauma bay he became more agitated and began to pull at the cable that protruded 1.5 feet outside of his mouth. We decided to sedate and intubate him to facilitate further evaluation and treatment of his injuries. After 30 mg of etomidate and 100 mg of succinylcholine administered intravenously, blood and construction site debris was suctioned from his oropharynx, and he was intubated using the GlideScope Portable GVL and a 7.5 endotracheal tube on the first attempt.\nThe patient was taken for an IV-contrasted computed tomography of his brain, face, and neck to assess vascular injury and define the extent of damage ().\nThe patient was taken to the operating room for cable removal, neck exploration, facial nerve exploration, right temporal craniotomy, and tracheostomy. He was found to have a cranial nerve XII paralysis, right temporal and parietal lobe traumatic brain injury and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, right cochlea damage, and some general soft tissue damage. On post-operative day 3, he was transferred to the floor on a liquid diet. On post-operative day 7 he was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis after developing a headache, fever, and neck rigidity. On post-operative day 13 he was discharged on oral antibiotics to a rehabilitation facility."
"A 25-year-old female veterinary doctor came to our outpatient department in April 2012 with a 2-day history of foreign body sensation, burning, and excessive watering from her left eye. She gave a history of something falling in her eye while she was working in her outpatient department. She was absolutely fine before that and had no significant ocular or medical history.\nThe visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Eyelids of the affected right eye were absolutely normal. The conjunctiva was congested with profuse lacrimation. Extra-ocular movements were full and free in all directions of gaze. On slit lamp examination there was the presence of tiny translucent larvae, 1-2 mm in size with dark heads, crawling over the bulbar conjunctiva. The larvae were photosensitive and tended to move toward the fornix under slit lamp illumination. Cornea was not involved. Pupillary reaction was normal. After topical Lidocaine 4% drops about three larvae were removed with the help of cotton swab sticks and fine plane forceps. The organisms were placed in normal saline for identification. The anterior chamber was quiet. Direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy showed no evidence of intraocular organisms or inflammation. Examination of her left eye was normal. Topical moxifloxacin eye drops 0.5% for six times a day was prescribed. When the patient came for a follow-up 2 days later, she was completely relieved of her symptoms of foreign body sensation and excessive watering. Slit lamp examination of the anterior segment and fundus was normal. Her vision was 20/20 and she was asked to stop all medication. The larvae mounted on a microscopic slide were examined carefully and photographed under a microscope. They were segmented and had two large dark oral hooks, connected to a white cephalopharyngeal skeleton. The body was translucent []."
"A 25-year-old female presented with a painless lump in her right breast for 1 month duration. She gave history of low grade fever off and on for the last 2 weeks. There were no other complaints like weight loss, loss of appetite, and any cough. She was unmarried and there was no positive family history of breast tuberculosis. On local examination, a non-tender lump of size 3 × 4 cm was felt in lower quadrant of the breast [marked with a line as a - ]. It was freely mobile and no axillary nodes were present. Another 1 × 1.5 cm swelling was present in infra-mammary area just below and medial to the above mentioned lump [marked by line b; ]. Her systemic examination was non-contributory.\nOn routine blood investigations, total leucocyte count was 12,000 mm3 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 60 mm at the end of 1 h, and HIV test was negative. Her fasting blood sugar and blood urea levels were normal. Chest X-ray was normal. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the breast and infra-mammary lump showed granulomas, epitheloid cells, and mixed inflammatory cells []. Background consisted of necrotic material and ZN stain for acid fast bacilli (AFB) was positive in the FNAC of both lumps. Mountex test was not done as on FNAC diagnosis already was made. Final diagnosis made as breast TB.\nShe was put on a 6-month course of anti-tubercular therapy with a 2 month intensive phase of rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide followed by a consolidation phase of rifampicin and isoniazid for another 4 months. The lump size was decreased within 3 weeks of initiation of ATT and at 3 month follow-up the patient remains asymptomatic and both lumps disappeared. She was advised to continue treatment."
"A 25-year-old P1L1 lady presented with a 8-month-old mass over her anterior abdominal wall. She complained of incapacitating pain in the swelling, which started a week before menstruation and subsided a week after her periods. She also reported a corresponding fluctuation in the size of the swelling during each cycle. The patient had undergone LSCS 5 years earlier.\nOn examination, the swelling was found to be located on the left side of the anterior abdominal wall, close to the previous Pfannenstiel incisional scar. It measured 4 × 4 cm, was firm, had well-defined borders, and was situated in the subcutaneous plane. There was no clinical or sonological evidence of pelvic endometriosis.\nSurgical excision was performed, leaving a wide margin on all sides. Perioperatively, swelling was found attached to the anterior rectus sheath, part of which was also excised. The rectus sheath defect measuring 3 × 2 cm was repaired with number Prolene #1 suture. The recovery was uneventful.\nGrossly, the excised specimen was an irregular fibro-fatty mass, which on cut section showed a nodular tissue grayish-white in colour with multiple cysts []. Histopathology revealed fibro adipose tissue with scattered endometrial glands surrounded by endometrial stroma []. These features confirmed the diagnosis of IE. The patient was followed for 6 months after the excision. She was completely relieved of her symptoms by then."
"A 25-year-old male presented with mild pain in the right eye on and off since 1 year, along with progressive proptosis and periorbital swelling for last 4 months. He complained of diminution of vision and diplopia since 3 months, which initially progressed but became static at the time of presentation. There was no history of any trauma, loss of consciousness or fever. Examination of extraocular muscles showed restricted upward gaze. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mildly enhancing right orbital mass abutting superior rectus muscle with displacement of eyeball anteriorly, inferiorly and laterally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lobulated right supraorbital extradural mass lesion, predominantly occupying superomedial extraconal compartment and infiltrating intraconally. The mass was isointense to grey matter and showed heterogeneous contrast enhancement. No intracranial extension was noted. Aspiration cytology smears revealed scattered and groups of monotonous population of cells with round to oval nuclei, prominent large nucleoli, few with intranuclear inclusions and abundant pale finely vacuolated to granular cytoplasm. Few cells also showed disrupted cytoplasm, with fraying of the cytoplasmic margins []. Few larger fragments had cohesive cells in clusters, while other areas showed central round nuclei in a sea of cytoplasm. Bare nuclear forms were also noted. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) with diastase stain revealed magenta pink intracytoplasmic granules and occasional slender crystalline structures []. The tumor, located between orbital roof and globe, was excised through right supraorbital keyhole craniotomy. The excised mass was soft to firm, highly vascular, non-suckable, with ill-defined plane of cleavage. Histopathology showed characteristic alveolar pattern and cellular morphology of ASPS []; however, the immunohistochemical panel applied was not contributory. Electron microscopy showed increased number and abnormal clustering of mitochondria, prominent endoplasmic reticulum, glycogen vacuoles, along with few electron-dense bodies []. However, the characteristic rhomboid crystalline lattice was not seen. On extensive workup and thorough imaging, no mass lesion was detected at any other site. Radiation was difficult in this patient with orbital lesion due to the fear of visual compromise; hence, he was offered chemotherapy, with no further growth of the lesion or metastatic disease on 6 months of follow-up."
"We present the case of a 25-year-old male subject, diagnosed with topographic and topometric asymmetrically manifested KCN among his two eyes. Informed consent was obtained from the subject.\nThe right eye (OD) had an uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/20 and a manifest refraction of plano −0.50 × 170°. Corrected distance visual acuity with this prescription was 20/20+. The left eye (OS), the more symptomatic one, had an uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/80 and a manifest refraction −7.00 −3.50 × 75°. Corrected distance visual acuity with this prescription was 20/30. The KCN diagnosis was further confirmed by corneal tomography imaging, obtained by WaveLight® OculyzerTM II (Alcon Surgical, Ft. Worth, Tex., USA) which is a Pentacam HR (high-resolution) Scheimpflug imaging camera [2[GA1]]. Examples of anterior corneal surface sagittal curvature maps are shown in fig. for OD and fig. for OS.\nFour consecutive corneal scans in each eye were obtained by AS-OCT RTVue-100 (Optovue Inc., Fremont, Calif., USA), software version A6 (9, 0, 27). Examples of OD and OS epithelial pachymetry maps (6 mm diameter) are provided in fig. , respectively. Repeatability, which can be assessed by the standard deviation of the central epithelium of the 4 scans, was 0.60 and 1.50 μm in OD and OS, respectively.\nAs shown in fig. , OD had a central epithelial thickness (Epi CT) of 52.23 ± 0.60 μm. Overall epithelial thickness (Epi Average) was computed by taking the average of the 17 segment thickness points shown in fig. . The values displayed in each of the 17 segments are the average of the epithelial thickness measurements within each segment. OD had an Epi Average of 51.97 ± 0.70 μm. OS had an Epi CT of 56.75 ± 1.50 μm and an Epi Average of 55.65 ± 1.22 μm.\nThe epithelial topographic thickness variability (Epi Variability, fig. ) was calculated as the standard deviation of the 17 thickness points. Our results show that on average, the Epi Variability was 1.53 ± 0.21 μm for the less affected OD, while it was 9.80 ± 0.41 μm for the more affected OS."
"A 25-year-old young, married woman was referred to the psychiatry outpatient department by the dermatologist. A detailed evaluation revealed that the patient was having depressive symptoms since a year. Her predominant symptoms included sadness of mood, helplessness, hopelessness, feeling of lethargy, and inability to do her routine household work. This created interpersonal problems with her in-laws who considered her to be slow in her work and would repeatedly taunt her. The patient was married young and she still had difficulty in adjusting in her in-laws' home. She had also lost her mother at a young age and was unable to share her marital problems with any of her relatives including her siblings. The ongoing continuous interpersonal stressors had now affected her sleep and appetite, and since a year, she had also become very irritable. She was extremely worried about her future and felt that her situation was hopeless. It was during one of her visits to her dermatologist that she voiced her grievances due to which she was referred to psychiatry.\nThe detailed psychiatry evaluation revealed the patient to be suffering from a mild depressive disorder without somatic symptoms as per the ICD10 criteria.[] She had recently developed symptoms of bruising associated with pain over arms and face, occurring recurrently after a fall from the stairs for which she was under treatment from the dermatologist and was diagnosed as having Gardner Diamond syndrome. These symptoms of bruising and associated pain would occur nearly on a daily basis on either her arms, forearms, or predominantly over her cheeks []. They would resolve over a week and new lesions would crop up. As per the dermatologist, there was no known treatment for this syndrome, and the patient was prescribed analgesics for the symptoms of pain. In view of her depressive symptoms, the patient was started on antidepressant Tab. escitalopram 5 mg at night, which was gradually increased to 10 mg over the next fortnight. What was surprising was that as her depression improved and the patient started feeling better, her symptoms of recurrent bruising and pain completely subsided and in her follow-up of 2 months, the patient is currently symptom free, maintained on the antidepressant."
"A 25-year-old unmarried man presented with generalized multiple painful tumors of 8 years duration. Lesions begun as small pea-sized, skin-colored papules over right lower limb. As it was asymptomatic, patient neglected the skin lesions. Gradually, the lesions over the right lower limb increased in size to 4-6 centimeters. For the past 4 years, multiple new lesions started appearing over trunk, left lower limb, and upper limb. Large lesions were painful for touch and cold. No history of ulceration, discharge from the lesions, or systemic complaints. No history of similar complaints in family/first-degree relatives. Birth and developmental history was normal. On examination, multiple soft to firm tumors of varying in size from 5 mm to 5 cms were seen over the entire length of right lower limb [Figures and ]. Few tumors were also seen over left lower limb, upper limb, upper chest, and back []. Tumors were mobile, tender with shiny skin and telengeictasia over surface. Palms and soles were normal. Oral and genital mucosa was normal. Histopathology revealed normal epidermis and dermis showing interweaving bundles of spindle-shaped cells of dermal smooth muscle, which were strongly eosinophilic [Figures and ]. Patient was started on daily oral 20 mg nifedepine. Large tumors of more than 3 centimeters were excised under local anesthesia, as they were very painful and cosmetically disfiguring."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with sudden onset of loss of consciousness for two hours. No history of hypertension or bleeding disorders could be identified. Non enhanced head computed tomography (CT) was performed revealing a large subcortical hematoma in the left parietal area []. The CT angiography (CTA) revealed a small aneurysm in the periphery of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) [Figures –]. The Glasgow Coma Score before surgery was seven. An emergency craniotomy was performed to remove the hematoma. A pseudo aneurysm of 0.8 cm. in diameter with perforation was identified at the left parietal lobe. The aneurysm was excised smoothly and a craniectomy was done secondary to brain swelling. The patient regained consciousness postoperatively with no neurologic deficit. Immunohistochemical staining of the aneurysm revealed a positive cytokeratin and beta – hCG [Figures –]. A chest X-ray showed multiple lung masses giving the impression of lung metastasis. Based on these studies, the diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma was made. Serum beta – hCG was 73,656 ng/ml. After diagnosis, the patient received chemotherapy with EMA-CO regimen. Her beta – hCG decreased from 73,656 ng/ml to 3.8 ng/ml after three courses of chemotherapy."
"A 25-year-old female patient was admitted with a complaint of black spots on her face. Lesions were present since the age of 13 years, and with a diagnosis of acne, she had used topical antibiotics (clindamycin and tetracycline) without any improvement. Dermatological examination revealed multiple black-colored macules located bilaterally on the cheeks and nose []. Dermoscopic examination revealed that the black macules were actually vellus hair. To examine these hairs, a standard skin surface biopsy (SSSB) was performed. Multiple vellus hair bundles in funnel-shaped structures were observed under the microscope [], and a diagnosis of ‘TS’ was made. A topically applied treatment, composed of 0.025% tretinoin and 4% erythromycin gel, was recommended daily at bedtime. Six weeks later, the appearance of black macular lesions on the face was significantly reduced. However, due to her pregnancy, the treatment had to be terminated, and her lesions recurred within 1 month."
"A 25 year-old woman was diagnosed with invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the left breast (stage T3N2M0). She was initially treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy using doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and received left modified radical mastectomy. She underwent four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy using the same regimens, and followed by radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy using paclitaxel and hormonal therapy using tamoxifen. After 24 months, the patient developed multiple hepatic lesions that had metastasized from the breast cancer. Blood chemistry revealed the following findings at the time; hemoglobin, 10.9 g/dL; leukocyte count, 3,110/mm3; platelet count, 227,000/mm3; total protein, 8.2 g/dL; albumin 4.3 g/dL; total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL; AST, 110 IU/L; ALT, 64 IU/L; ALP, 127 IU/L. Tumor analysis revealed a CA15-3 level of 206 U/mL (normal range, 0-28 U/mL). She was immunologically negative for hepatitis B and C viral infection. Combined chemotherapy using docetaxel and cisplatin was initiated. A follow-up CT performed after 2 months revealed the development of hepatomegaly and decreased parenchymal attenuation of the liver suggesting fatty infiltration. Some metastatic lesions in the liver coalesced while others decreased (). A follow-up of the blood chemistry revealed the following: hemoglobin, 8.5 g/dL; leukocyte count, 530/mm3; platelet count, 50,000/mm3; total protein, 5.1 g/dL; albumin 2.7 g/dL; total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL; AST, 233 IU/L; ALT, 74 IU/L; ALP, 476 IU/L. CA15-3 had increased to 560 U/mL. CT performed after 5 months showed that the liver volume had decreased, while hypertrophy of the left liver was noted. In addition, the hepatic surface had become more lobulated (). On the final follow-up CT performed after 9 months, the shrinkage of the liver was more prominent and perihepatic ascites had developed (). Follow-up blood chemistry showed that the total bilirubin level and hepatic enzymes had decreased (total bilirubin, 1.2 mg/dL; AST, 93 IU/L; ALT, 66 IU/L), and that CA15-3 had also decreased to 140 U/mL. Thereafter, fulminant hepatic failure developed at which time her serum bilirubin level increased to 32.3 mg/dL. She expired a year after initial detection of hepatic metastasis."
"A 25-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital's hematology ward with the diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia. He was being treated with the hyper-CVAD chemotherapy regimen. The hyper-CVAD regimen delivers a combination of drugs in 2 cycles (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone in cycle A, methotrexate and cytarabine in cycle B), split into smaller doses and administered at more frequent intervals in order to minimize side effects.\nDuring hospitalization, a dermatology assessment was requested. The dermatological examination showed nail injury characterized by transverse, brown-gray hyperpigmentation affecting the proximal half of the nail plate, with a brown band delimiting the healthy nail plate on all fingers (fig. , fig. , fig. )."
"A 25-year-old man sustained fracture dislocation at T7-T8 vertebrae following a road traffic accident. He was scheduled for pedicle screw fixation of T7-T8 vertebrae two weeks after injury. On pre-anesthetic evaluation, patient presented with complaints of inability to move his lower limbs and numbness in lower half of body. Clinical examination revealed a conscious, well oriented, afebrile patient with pulse rate of 76 beats per minute and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Central nervous examination revealed complete bilateral flaccid paralysis (paraplegia) and loss of all sensations below T9 dermatome with areflexia. There was no voluntary contraction of the anal sphincter with absence of sensation around the anus. Magnetic resonance imaging showed complete transaction of spinal cord at T10 level. All routine investigations were within normal limits.\nWhile applying standard monitoring in the operating room, it was found that patient’s urinary bladder was distended up to the umbilicus though a bladder was in situ. It was decided to induce anesthesia and thereafter change of blocked urinary catheter and place central venous pressure and intra-arterial pressure monitoring lines. After adequate preloading, general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 100 mcg and thiopentone 250 mg intravenous (IV). Tracheal intubation was done after adequate relaxation with 6 mg vecuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide. Post-induction vitals were stable with 100% saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide of 36 mmHg. Blocked urinary catheter was removed and re-catheterization done. 1500 ml of urine was drained. Subsequent to bladder catheterization and decompression, patient developed polymorphic premature ventricular contractions with hypertension. Isoflurane concentration was increased, but it was followed by severe bradycardia (38 beats per minute) with malignant hypertension (220 mmHg/100 mmHg). Sodium nitroprusside was started at a rate of 1 mcg/kg/min. As bradycardia was refractory, atropine 1 mg IV was administered. Despite this, patient developed asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started with 100% oxygen. Sodium nitroprusside was stopped immediately and repeat dose of atropine 1 mg IV was given. Advanced cardiac life support was continued for 30 min with no return of spontaneous circulation. Autopsy revealed mildly dilated heart with a weight of 350 g. All three major coronary arteries were normal and histological examination showed no infarction."
"A 25-year old P1L1 woman presented to the emergency two day post partum with bluish discoloration of hands and feet. Pregnancy had been unsupervised but she had received tetanus immunization. Delivery had been conducted at home by an unskilled midwife and she had been administered a single intramuscular injection of ergot postpartum. There was no prior history of intermittent claudication, cold or heat intolerance, tobacco smoking, collagen vascular disease or similar family history. Vitals were stable, all peripheral pulses were palpable. Extremities were cold, swollen with purple discoloration of both hands extending to wrist joints. Similar changes were seen in feet extending to mid calf. Both hands and feet had blue-black nail beds. On per abdominal examination a well contracted uterus corresponding to 20 weeks gravid size was felt. On local examination, a complete perineal tear with black gangrenous margins and excoriation was present; similar patchy changes were seen over lower abdomen and the mons pubis. Internal examination was normal. A differential diagnosis of early gangrene was made.\nOn investigation her Hb was 9 g/dl, total leukocyte count (TLC) 18,000/mm, platelet count 250.000/mm; liver function tests: (LFT) serum bilirubin (t) 8 mg/dl, ALT/AST 28/25 and kidney function tests: (KFT) serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dl and blood urea 11 mg/dl. On sepsis work-up, her blood and urine cultures were sterile and culture taken from perineal wound had no pathogenic growth. The patient's ELISA for HIV was negative and VDRL was non-reactive. On coagulation screen her PT was 12 s and PTTK 32 s. On transvaginal ultrasonography uterine cavity was empty. Patient was further investigated for all possible causes of peripheral gangrene which included antiphospholipid antibody testing (ACL Ig G and Ig M and LAC which all were negative), lipid profile (Serum chol sterol 140 mgs/dl, Serum TG 110 mg/dl, HDL-chol 40 mg/dl), antinuclear anti-body and rheumatoid factors were negative too. Color Doppler of lower limb vessels was done which indicated normal flow.\nSurgical consultation was sought and perineal wound debrided. Therapy in the form of broad spectrum antibiotics, low molecular weight dextran and a hemorheologic agent, pentoxyphylline, was started. By day five, improvement was noted with subsidence of swelling and sharp demarcation of margins (). Patient lost most nails of both hands and feet by day 28, gangrenous scabs were shed from tips of fingers while the toes still had scabs (). Patient was discharged on pentoxyphylline, with advice on the care of hands and feet. By six weeks there was regrowth of nails but scabs on feet remained. By eight weeks hands, feet and mons pubis appeared normal."
"A 25-year-old female presented with complaints of primary amenorrhea. She stated that she became sexually active at 17 years and had noted changes associated with puberty around 14 years of age. She was of short stature (height 90 cm; weight 30 kg), had facial dysmorphism, macrocephaly, short neck, and low hair line. The patient had normal breast development, normal body hair distribution, including pubic and axillary hair. Pelvic examination showed her vulva, labia minora and majora, and clitoris as normal and well estrogenized. The vagina was found to be blindly ending, with the length of 6 cm.\nBlood routine and renal function tests were normal. Hormone profile included measurement of follicular stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which were all normal, indicating normal hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed a blind vagina and poorly formed uterus and absent left kidney. The single right pelvic kidney was within normal limits for size and appearance. Magnetic resonance imaging abdomen revealed absent uterus and vagina presence of ovary at both para iliac region and absent left kidney; Grade-I spondylolisthesis with bilateral spondylosis at L5-S1 level [Figures and ]. Chromosomal study indicated normal (46, XX) female karyotype [], which, obviously, is what differentiates MRKH syndrome from other genital tract development defects such as Turner syndrome (45, 0X) and androgen insensitivity syndrome (46, XY). Two-dimensional echocardiogram carried out was normal. Computed tomography brain carried out showed Dandy Walker malformation with vermian hypoplasia, partial agenesis of corpus callosum, and colpocephaly with obstructive hydrocephalus []. X-ray skull showed Macrocephaly []."
"A 25-year-old man was diagnosed with subdural hemorrhage and underwent decompression via a pterional approach by a neurosurgeon. When his symptoms improved, the patient underwent cranioplasty using the cryopreserved autogenous cranial bone. The ulcer occurred along the incision line. Despite being treated with ambulatory treatments, it had still not healed at postoperative four months. At the time of the outpatient visit, the patient presented with full-thickness scalp defects 20 mm×10 mm in size, where the discolored bone was exposed. In addition, the hair and follicles were also exposed in the subcutaneous layer adjacent to the ulcer (). After identifying methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, the patient received nine days of pre-treatment. Following the resection of the ulcer and the adjacent scar tissue, there was a discoloration in the overall layer of the grafted calvarial bone. We removed this layer, including its inner table. By using the left occipital artery, the right supraocular artery, and the supratrochlear artery as a pedicle, we performed a bipedicled pericranial flap. In addition, we elevated a unipedicled pericranial flap, where the superficial temporal artery served as a pedicle, to cover the defects after the removal of the cranial bone. Until postoperative four months, the patient had good aesthetic outcomes without developing any notable complications."
"A 25-year-old male had a chest X-ray taken as part of a routine health examination; the results showed a large mass in the right paratracheal space (). He had had acute lymphoblastic leukemia 11 years earlier but was in complete remission. He was asymptomatic, had no pain, cough, or dyspnea. His physical examination was normal, and all laboratory tests were within normal limits except mild leukocytosis (12.1 × 103/µL, normal range 3.9-9.7). Contrast-enhanced chest CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT were performed to rule out malignant lymphadenopathy (). The mass showed mild homogeneous enhancement with a longitudinal dimension of approximately 8.0 cm in the right paratracheal space in the transaxial view on contrast-enhanced chest CT (Brilliance CT 16-slice, Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH, USA). No abnormality was observed in the lung parenchyma (). The patient underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT (Discovery STe scanner, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) after fasting for at least 6 hours. Unenhanced CT was performed by a continuous spiral technique using a 16-slice helical CT (120 KeV, 80-200 mAs with AutomA mode, a section width of 3.75 mm) 60 minutes after injection of 370 MBq 18F-FDG. After CT scan, an emission scan was obtained from the thigh to the head for 3 minutes per frame in the 3-dimensional (3D) mode. Attenuation-corrected PET images using CT data were reconstructed by a 3D ordered-subsets expectation maximization algorithm (20 subsets, 2 iterations). A huge mass with lobulated borders was found in the right paratracheal space; the mean Hounsfield unit of the mass was 36 on unenhanced CT of 18F-FDG PET/CT. On PET images, the mass showed heterogeneous 18F-FDG uptake, with the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 5.0 (). No 18F-FDG uptake suggesting metastases was observed on PET/CT.\nThese clinical and radiological findings suggested malignant lymphadenopathy associated with recurrent leukemia. The patient underwent mediastinoscopic biopsy. Histopathology suggested an inflammatory pseudotumor. The mass was removed via thoracotomy. The tumor was a multinodular mass, measuring about 8 × 6 × 5 cm. On the cut section, the mass was lobulated by intervening fibrous tissue, showing a yellow-brown or yellow-white color with a myxoid character. Histopathologically, the tumor contained multifocal patchy infiltration of B and T lymphoid cells, plasma cells, histiocytes, and fibroblastic cells in a fibrocollagenous stroma (). The final diagnosis was an inflammatory pseudotumor, fibrohistiocytic type."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to our clinic with the complaint of decay in the right back region of the upper jaw. On clinical examination, dentinal caries was observed on the occlusal surface of upper right first molar. Macrodontia was observed in relation to the maxillary central incisors. The central incisors were larger in the mesiodistal dimension. There was a notching present in relation to the incisal edge of the macrodonts. On the right central incisor, the notch continued cervically as a shallow groove [], whereas on the left central incisor, the groove continued only till the middle third of the crown. The lateral incisors were placed palatally. The patient had normal compliment of teeth for his age. The intra-oral periapical radiograph of the maxillary anterior region revealed large crowns of the central incisors bilaterally. A radiolucent notch was observed in relation to the incisal edges of the central incisors []. Relatively large pulp chambers and root canals were observed in relation to the central incisors, which suggestive of bilateral gemination.\nSince the patient was not concerned about the esthetic problems due to macrodontia, only composite restoration in relation to the right maxillary first molar was done."
"A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute severe right flank pain for a day and history of similar milder pain for the last year. Ultrasound revealed right hydroureteronephrosis with proximal ureteric calculus. IVU showed right grade 4 hydronephrosis with a calculus overlying the pedicle of L3 vertebra. CT showed right hydronephrosis with renal and proximal ureteric calculi, but the intimate relation of ureter and IVC raised the possibility of a circumcaval ureter. MRU unequivocally depicted the circumcaval course of the ureter and two calculi proximal to the obstruction []."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics with the chief complaint of severe pain in the left upper back region of the mouth since 3 days. Pain was continuous and aggravated with the intake of hot and cold beverages. Clinical examination revealed deep mesial caries approximating pulp with respect to tooth # 26. The tooth was not tender to percussion and palpation. Pulp vitality testing using an electric pulp tester (Parkell, Farmingdale, NY, USA) showed exaggerated response lasting for several minutes. Further, the maxillary lateral incisors were missing and the deciduous right maxillary first molar was overretained. Intraoral periapical radiograph of tooth # 26 revealed deep caries involving the pulp space []. Also, a single root with single canal was seen in relation to 26 and 27. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, the diagnosis of acute irreversible pulpitis was made and patient was advised root canal treatment in relation to tooth # 26. After obtaining patient's consent, an emergency pulpotomy was performed at the same visit under local anesthesia. In order to confirm the apparent finding of the IOPA radiograph, the patient was referred for CBCT imaging of tooth 26 with 3D reconstruction. The results of the CBCT showed the presence of a single root with the Vertucci's type I canal configuration,[] and the same was observed for tooth 27 []. Thereafter, the root canal treatment was initiated. The tooth was isolated using rubber dam and access preparation was modified to completely de-roof the pulp chamber, which showed the presence of a single wide root canal orifice. Working length was calculated using an electronic apex locator (Root ZX II™, Morrita, Tokyo, Japan) as well as the radiographic method. Working length radiograph also suggested positioning of endodontic files in a single canal []. The coronal shaping was carried out using Gates Glidden burs (Dentsply, New Delhi, India) in crown down manner followed by step back technique with an apical enlargement up to size 55 K file (Dentsply) along with copious irrigation with 5% sodium hypochlorite solution. The canal was finally rinsed with 17% EDTA solution and dried with absorbent paper points (Dentsply, New Delhi, India). The root canal was obturated using a resin-based endodontic sealer (AH PLUS™; Dentsply) and laterally condensed gutta percha followed by restoration of access preparation with silver amalgam. Posttreatment radiograph showed the adequate sealing of the root canal system and the patient was asymptomatic []. The patient was advised complete coverage restoration and referred to the Department of Prosthodontics for the same."
"25 year old lady presented with swelling and pain of left thigh of seven years duration. This gradually increased in size without weight loss or proximal muscle weakness. She did not have difficulty in walking and her activities of daily living were not affected by the pain. Examination of the left thigh revealed bowing of the left femur and a soft tissue swelling not attached to the bone. The size of the swelling was 2 × 3 cm, mobile and mildly tender to palpation.\nShe had attained menarche at the age of 13 years and had normal menstrual cycles. She was married for the past one and a half years and had not conceived yet. Her body mass index was 25.1 kg/m2 with height of 150 cm. She did not have any bony deformity or café au lait spots. On biochemical evaluation she had normal alkaline phosphatase, normal serum calcium, phosphorous and 24 hrs urine calcium, phosphorous and creatinine. She had a low level of 25 hydroxy vitamin D of 4.85 ng/ml (20.0-32.0 ng/ml) X-rays of pelvis and hip showed expansile bony swelling with cortical thinning of both tibia []. She underwent a bone scan which showed abnormal, irregularly increased tracer activity in left scapula, left tibia, left femur, pubis and left sacroiliac joints, L5 vertebra, left distal humerus and multiple ribs [], suggestive of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. MRI of the left thigh showed well defined intramuscular mass lesions []. These lesions were hypointense on T1 weighted image and hyperintense on T2W. They were partly exophytic and measured: 28 × 41 mm in the anteromedial aspect of right adductor longus, 16 × 23 mm in the right adductor magnus at the level of mid-thigh and 9 × 10 mm in the gluteus maximus A bone biopsy [] from the left femur revealed fibrous dysplasia and a biopsy of the soft tissue mass from left thigh was confirmed as intramuscular myxoma []."
"In 2009, a 25-year-old man was referred to the dermatology department with a 3-month history of a rapidly growing painful mass on his right buttock which subsequently ulcerated. Skin examination revealed an erythematous infiltrated plaque and an ulcerated lesion with fibrinous exudate in the gluteal region (). There were no lymphadenopathies or other abnormalities on physical examination. A skin biopsy of the ulcerated lesion revealed proliferation of pleomorphic epithelioid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Scattered rhabdoid cells characterized by abundant glassy cytoplasm, eccentric nuclei and prominent nucleoli were observed throughout the lesion (). Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for vimentin, cytokeratin, EMA, CAM 5.2, MIB and CD34 for the latter marker positivity was focal confirming the diagnosis of proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma (). Blood count and serum biochemistry were unremarkable, and culture for mycobacteria, fungi and aerobic bacteria were negative. At the time of diagnosis, the tests to define clinical staging, which included a computed tomography scan, revealed numerous metastatic lesions in the brain and lungs (). The patient received chemotherapy at a reference oncology institute but died in the ninth month of follow-up."
"A 25 year-old man was hospitalized in a public hospital with the following complaints: ascites, prominent venous collaterals on the abdominal wall, swelling in the legs and cutaneous lesions. Two years earlier, he had developed asymmetric recurrent migratory arthritis, aseptic meningitis, moderate and intermittent fever, recurrent lesions in the oral cavity and unilateral blindness. He denied smoking and alcoholism. Physical examination showed jaundice, acneiform eruptions on the abdomen, oral ulcers, reduced vesicular murmur at right lung base, ascites with varicose veins in the abdomen near the skin surface, an enlarged and tender liver and edema of legs (++/4) ( and ). Laboratory tests detected hypochromic and microcytic anemia; nonreactive viral hepatitis serology, HIV and syphilis infection serology; negative autoantibodies; normal rheumatoid factor and serum complement; low levels of protein C and S, and normal levels of antithrombin III; high hemosedimentation velocity and C reactive protein; serum ascites albumin gradient greater than 1.1; and a negative skin pathergy test. Histopathology of papulopustular lesion showed show perifollicular and perivascular mononuclear and neutrophilic infiltration (). Endoscopy showed oesophageal varices. Doppler ultrasound examination and computed tomography showed ascites and absence of flow in the suprahepatic and cava veins ( and ). Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs showed thrombosis. The correlation of dermatological, pathological and imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis of BD in association with BCS. Symptomatic treatment was established with diuretics, oral corticosteroids, azathioprine, colchicine and anticoagulants. After such treatment was begun the patient had significant improvement, but died five months later due to haemorrhage complications."
"A 25-year-old gentleman, on anti-retroviral treatment for immunopositivity for HIV, since two years, presented to our institution 4 months back, with history of unexplained fever, weight loss and bilateral axillary swellings. On examination he had palpable bilateral axillary nodes. Recent CD4 count was 550 cells/mm3. A biopsy from the left axillary node confirmed it to be Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) B cell type. Patient was then referred for a baseline whole body 18-F Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (FDG PET/CT) study. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) images [] revealed multiple foci of increased tracer uptake in bilateral cervical, axillary, mediastinal and retroperitoneal regions. In addition, there were foci of intense uptake on the left side of abdomen (arrow) and in the pelvis (arrow head), which appeared to be due to physiological tracer excretion into the urinary bladder. Axial fused PET/CT images revealed multiple enlarged FDG avid bilateral axillary and mediastinal nodes. In addition, FDG uptake was seen in enlarged bilateral adrenal glands, left being more than right [, arrows]. There was focal FDG uptake seen in the body of pancreas on axial-fused PET/CT images [, arrow]. FDG uptake in the retroperitoneal region corresponded on CT and fused PET/CT images to exiting nerve roots from lumbar vertebrae [Figure and , arrow]. Also, the FDG uptake in the pelvis which appeared to be excreted tracer in bladder, was in fact seen in the enlarged prostate gland on CT and fused PET/CT images [Figure and , arrow]. Patient received two cycles of intravenous bolus chemotherapy regimen, R-EPOCH (Rituximab with etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone) with methotrexate, after which he was referred for a FDG PET/CT study for treatment response assessment. Post-treatment FDG PET/CT study revealed no abnormal focus of FDG uptake in the entire body, suggestive of complete metabolic and morphological response to treatment [, MIP image]."
"A 25-year-old separated female, studied till class VII, presented with diagnosis of undifferentiated schizophrenia (ICD-10) of 6 years duration. Patient had a delusion that she delivered a baby girl 1 year back and is yet to have a name for her baby. She gives an interesting description of delivery of this baby girl: Labor pain started when all her family members had gone out of the house. She also reports that the labor process got completed spontaneously without any complication and that soon after the delivery, the child was kept in an orphanage for children which no family member was aware of. Additionally, patient reports that her girl is growing in that ashrama and has been studying in primary school. However, she has not revealed any other information. Delusion of delivery (labor and childbirth) was concluded to be present."
"A 25-year-old Japanese woman sustained a right femoral shaft fracture while climbing the stairs in May 2012 (Fig. ). She denied any abuse or accident such as falling down the stairs. She had a history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which was poorly controlled with insulin therapy (HbA1c, 16.7 %), and Charcot arthropathy of the ankle due to peripheral nerve disorder. An ankle arthrodesis had been performed at another clinic 15 months ago, but union was not achieved, and therefore, she underwent further surgery 12 months ago to fix her ankle. This treatment also failed resulting in nonunion, and so the woman was instructed to wear a patellar tendon-bearing brace for her ankle instability and pain (Fig. ). Her laboratory data, including serum levels of alkaline phosphate, parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphorus, were normal, but her level of 1.25 vitamin D3 was low, and her left femoral bone density was extremely low (0.54 mg/cm2) and 2.0 standard deviations below the normal value for her age (Table ).\nWe treated the femoral shaft fracture with intramedullary nail fixation 29 days after the fracture occurred, because her chronic heart failure was too poor to allow for immediate surgery. We initiated teriparatide (20-μg subcutaneous injection daily) and alfacalcidol (1-μg oral administration daily) immediately after surgery because of severe osteoporosis and in an attempt to accelerate healing of the femoral fracture. There was no immobilization of the femur, but a non-weight-bearing period of 4 weeks was implemented postoperatively. From 2 weeks after the initiation of teriparatide therapy, plain radiography began showing callus formation on the femoral shaft fracture, and after 12 weeks, almost complete healing of the fractured bone was observed (Fig. ). We therefore allowed the woman to walk with full weight bearing. We noticed that her ankle pain disappeared once she had resumed walking. Radiography and computed tomography images revealed that union of the ankle had been achieved (Fig. ). No side effects attributable to the drug were observed during treatment, and her subsequent laboratory findings continued to be normal. At 6 months, the patient could walk without a brace and without any pain. Plain images taken at this time revealed complete healing of the fractured and nonunion sites."
"A 25-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of nasal obstruction and right facial pain. The patient also had rhinorrhea, anosmia and headache. The patient had no specific past history. A physical examination revealed a pinkish, irregularly shaped mass in both nasal cavities (). A computed tomography (CT) showed an enhanced mass filling both ethmoid sinuses, the right nasal cavity and nasopharynx, with secondary destruction of the ethmoidal roof, both medial orbital walls and the anterior wall of the sphenoid sinuses. An endoscopic biopsy was taken. Pathologic evaluation showed ""starry-sky"" pattern of tightly packed, medium sized uniform lymphoid cells interspersed with large pale histiocytes. In immunohistochemical staining, cells were positive for CD10, CD20, and Bcl-6, and negative for CD3, CD5, and Bcl-2. Ninety percent of the cells were positive for Ki-67 antigen. The serum was negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Chest and abdominopelvic CT and bone scan showed no evidence of metastasis. Positron-emission tomography (PET) showed lymphoid invasion of the sphenoid, mandible, both humeri and the right proximal femur. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and bone marrow (BM) showed normal pathological and chromosomal findings. He was initiated on chemotherapy, consisting of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, and cytarabine. After three cycles, he was in complete remission on follow-up CT and PET. Five months after the end of chemotherapy, there was no evidence of recurrence on PET."
"A 25-year-old lady presented to the urological emergency with complaint of episodes of dull aching colicky pain in the right lumbar region for the past 1 year, which had increased in severity and become continuous for the past 2 weeks. Pain was associated with fever, chills, nausea, and anorexia. She also reported weakness and malaise, but did not give any history of urinary or bowel complaints. Physical examination revealed a pulse rate of 104/min, low blood pressure of 104/60 mm of Hg, respiratory rate of 22/min, and a temperature of 101°F. There was tenderness in the right hypochondrium and the right renal angle, but no visible fullness. Keeping a differential diagnosis of gall stone disease and pyonephrosis, an urgent ultrasound examination was done which showed grade III dilatation of the right kidney with internal echoes and multiple calculi, largest of size 18 mm, located in the pelvis. The liver showed a hypoechoic lesion of 10 × 10.2 cm in the right lobe. A breach in the renal capsule was demonstrated, communicating with the lesion in the liver. Laboratory investigations revealed marked leukocytosis, severe anemia (5.5 g/dl), mildly deranged renal function (blood urea 60 mg/dl, serum creatinine 1.6 mg/dl) and coagulopathy (International Normalised Ratio 1.63). Based on a working diagnosis of pyonephrosis with liver abscess with septicemia, the patient was resuscitated with fluids and given intravenous antibiotics and blood transfusion. Dehydration and coagulopathy were corrected and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was obtained, revealing a hypodense peripherally enhancing lesion with air in the right lobe of the liver communicating with the upper calyx of the hydronephrotic right kidney with multiple calculi []. The function of the left kidney was normal as evident by normal contrast excretion. Right pleural effusion with consolidation of the right lower lobe of the lung was also seen. The patient's condition improved on antibiotics, and right DJ stenting was performed along with an ultrasound-guided drainage of 800 ml pus from the right lobe of the liver. Culture of both urine and pus grew Escherichia coli, sensitive to amikacin. She responded well to treatment and was discharged with a plan for right Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy after 6 weeks. On subsequent follow-up visits, ultrasonography showed minimal abscess in the liver."
"A 25-year-old female was referred to our service for the evaluation of a painless swelling on the right mid-facial region with rapid evolution since one month. Extra-oral examination revealed a diffuse swelling with respect to right mid-facial region that was firm and non tender on palpation causing significant facial asymmetry. Intra-oral examination revealed a firm, non tender swelling expanding the buccal cortex of right maxilla extending from the right first molar to third molar obliterating the buccal vestibule [Figure and ]. No palpable cervical lymphadenopathy was present.\nMaxillary occlusal view revealed radiolucent lesion with respect to right maxillary posterior region with interlaced bony trabeculae resulting in a multilocular spider web appearance; on basis of which a working diagnosis of odontogenic myxoma was made. Further to delineate the extent of the lesion, a computed tomography (CT) scan was carried out. CT scan (axial and coronal views) demonstrated a hypodense ill-defined expansile lesion of the right maxilla with expansion and thinning of the overlying buccal cortex and involvement of the right maxillary antrum. Destruction of the bony margins of medial and lateral walls of the right maxillary antrum, with extension into the nasal cavity resulting in the partial occlusion of the nasal passage was evident. CT scan also revealed destruction of the bony margin of posterior wall of the right maxillary antrum and lateral pterygoid plate. Right infra-orbital margin was seen pushed upwards with erosion of the medial wall of the orbit [Figure and ]. Irregular calcific strands were evident within the lesion [].\nSubsequently, an incisional biopsy was performed and the specimen was submitted for the histopathological examination. The specimen appeared macroscopically as soft gelatinous yellowish white mass with cut surface exhibiting characteristic slimy appearance. Light microscopic examination of the sections stained with H-E revealed spindle and stellate shaped fibroblastic cells set in a myxoid background with delicate haphazardly arranged collagen fibers interspersed with a variable number of tiny capillaries []. Few areas show isolated foci of residual bone []. Odontogenic islands, binucleated cells, cellular pleomorphism and mitotic figures were not appreciated. The histopathological features were consistent with the diagnosis of odontogenic myxoma. The tumor was surgically excised with partial enbloc resection of the maxilla. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient has since been kept on regular follow-up, and treatment planning for dental rehabilitation is currently underway."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with gradual onset right shoulder pain for 1 week, which was constant and achy in nature and radiated to the left shoulder, down to her back and bilateral flanks. The pain was worse on the right side. She also complained of weakness, decreased oral intake and nausea but did not have any fever, vomiting or diarrhea. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease since the year 1995 with extensive perianal disease complicated by abscess formation and rectovaginal fistula. She had also been put on filgrastim, a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) analog for chronic leucopenia secondary to azathioprine treatment for Crohn's disease. Physical examination at the time of current admission revealed pallor, mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 115/minute and blood pressure of 96/56 mm Hg. There was epigastric and costovertebral tenderness with mild voluntary guarding. There was no rebound tenderness and her bowel sounds were faint. WBC count was 4.5 × 109/L. Although the patient did not have significant electrolyte abnormalities (sodium: 137 mEq/L, potassium: 4.6 mEq/L), there was postural tachycardia and hypotension.\nMRI of the spine and sacroiliac joints did not reveal any evidence of infection/inflammation/disc disease that could be attributed as a cause of the pain. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed some edema in the rectum in keeping with her Crohn's disease as well as some mild terminal ileitis. There was also increased thickening and hypodensities in both the adrenals []. Further evaluation with MRI [Figure -] revealed that the adrenals were bulky bilaterally. They showed hypointense signal on T1WI and hyperintense signal intensity on T2WI without any demonstrable hemorrhage. Following administration of gadolinium-based contrast, there was no enhancement of the parenchyma signifying a lack of viable parenchyma, based on which a diagnosis of adrenal infarction without hemorrhage was made.\nBiochemical confirmation of adrenal insufficiency was made by low plasma cortisol (21 nmol/l) and ACTH stimulation test that failed to raise the plasma cortisol levels to more than 25 nmol/l. She did not have any altered skin pigmentation or any history of hypotensive episodes in the past making the possibility of a long standing primary adrenal insufficiency unlikely. The PTT and INR were normal. Anticardiolipin antibodies and Lupus-like anticoagulant were negative. She was put on replacement steroids for which she showed a good response. Her appetite improved and she was discharged with complete resolution of pain."
A 25-year-old female patient with a history of submucous septal resection presented with a long nose and an acute columellalabial angle. She wanted tip projection with cephalic rotation. An L-shaped columellar strut graft was used for tip plasty using the same methods previously mentioned ().
"A 25-year-old male presented with complaints of gradually increasing painless hard swelling in the right maxillary region and paresthesia on the right side of face along distribution of trigeminal nerve over a period of 1 month. Patient had undergone functional endoscopic sinus surgery 2 years ago. On physical examination, there was no ulceration or induration of overlying skin. Laboratory investigations including hemogram and blood glucose levels were normal, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology was negative.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed soft-tissue intensity lesion in the right premaxillary region, which was isointense on T1-weighted imaging and hypointense on T2-weighted imaging. Contiguous extension of lesion was noted along infraorbital nerve with widened infraorbital foramen, along the floor of orbit [], via the inferior orbital fissure into the pterygo-palatine fossa, through the foramen rotundum into the middle cranial fossa causing widening of foramen rotundum. In the middle cranial fossa, the lesion was limited to extradural space adjacent to cavernous sinus and Meckel's cave, with extension along the trigeminal nerve up to prepontine segment of trigeminal nerve []. Osseous destruction of the anterior wall of right maxillary sinus was seen with minimal mucosal thickening within. On contrast administration, the lesion showed homogenous enhancement [].\nOn imaging, among the differentials of fungal infection, lymphoma, and malignant lesions, fungal infection was favored. Biopsy was performed from premaxillary swelling, and fungal smear, cytology, and fungal culture were done. Histopathologic examination revealed granulomatous inflammation with giant cells. Giant cells showed intracytoplasmic nonseptate fungal hyphae which are highlighted by Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) stain []. Fungal culture on water agar plate revealed sporangiophores which were long, unbranched, grayish brown, and with funnel-shaped apophyses. This morphology was indicative of A. elegans.\nSurgical debridement of the maxillary component was performed and systemic amphotericin B was administered. Follow-up MRI after 2 months revealed significant reduction of the lesion []."
"A 25-year-old female patient was referred to our department with a chronic headache. Patient's first diagnosis hypothesis was sinusitis and she had previously been referred to an otolaryngologist. Waters’ radiograph was performed, which demonstrated a limited radiopacity area into the right maxillary sinus. The patient's medical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, the patient was healthy, without swelling. The mucosa overlying the area of the lesion was the same color and texture as the surrounding mucosa. The sensory examination of the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve was normal bilaterally. Furthermore, she had aesthetic concerns about her high smile. Facial and cephalometrical examination revealed an excessively facial height and an excessive incisal and gingival display upon smiling. She was diagnosed with vertical maxillary excess and Class I malocclusion []. Initially, the patient was treated for third molar extraction 7 years ago; in this panoramic radiograph, was observed a discrete radiopacity area in the left maxillary sinus. It was probably an early stage of the lesion.\nA biopsy was taken with a Caldwell-Luc approach; histological result show abundant myxoid stroma with collagen fibrils presenting a diagnosis of OM.\nThe treatment planned was Le Fort I osteotomy with down-fracture to remove the tumor with segmental maxillectomy and 5 mm superior maxillary repositioning for better occlusion and facial esthetic.\nSurgery was performed under general anesthesia and nasal endotracheal intubation. Pre-orthognathic surgical models, radiographs, computed tomography face, photographs and biomodels were obtained before the surgery []. When the maxilla was down fractured, the tumor mass was visualized in the right maxillary sinus with four teeth involved in the lesion, which were removed. After the segmental maxillectomy, maxillary segment was stabilized with plate and screw in the anterior area on the right side and fixation on the anterior and posterior maxillary buttress on the left side. No intermaxillary fixation was used and it was not necessary turbinectomy.\nThe 3 years follow-up show satisfaction for the occlusal and esthetic result and the patient is disease-free []. A removable dental prosthesis without functional or aesthetic compromise is used []."
"A 25-year-old female patient was referred to the department of Periodontology with a gingival swelling in the upper right back region. The lesion was an incidental finding by her dentist at a routine dental check-up. A history suggested the swelling had been present for approximately 6 months. This swelling had not caused any pain and no other symptoms were reported by patient. The medical history was non-contributory and the patient did not smoke or drink alcohol.\nOn local examination, the lesion was smooth, firm with sessile base, non-ulcerated, painless, with normal color measuring 4 mm × 10 mm, extending from the mesial of maxillary right first premolar to the mesial of maxillary right first molar involving the marginal, papillary, and attached gingiva []. Intra oral periapical radiograph showed a mild crestal bone loss between 13 and 14 and between 14 and 15 [].\nBased on texture, differential diagnosis of granuloma or a possible fibroma was made. A punch biopsy of the lesion was conducted under local anesthesia and the specimen was submitted to routine histopathological analysis [Figures and ].\nHistopathologically, hematoloxylin, and eosin stained biopsy sections showed spindle-shaped cells, with fusiform or wavy comma-shaped nuclei distributed on a background of delicate connective tissue matrix [].\nHaving confirmed the occurrence of a neurofibrona, a complete exploration was made. There was no relevant family history and no evidence of NF, such as café-au-lait macules or freckling in the axillary and inguinal regions. No lisch nodules were detected during an ophthalmological study. The patient showed normal physical and mental development. With the above clinical and histological findings, the diagnosis of solitary neurofibroma of the gingiva was made and complete excision of the lesion was planned.\nUnder local anesthesia complete excision was achieved using no. 15 blade. The growth was carefully dissected and separated from the underlying tissues [Figures and ]. The excised specimen was almost 0.5 cm × 1 cm in size []. The bed of the lesion was examined for remnants, hemostasis was achieved and Coe pack was placed [Figures and ]. The post-operative period was uneventful. The patient was kept on a constant follow-up [] and after 12 months, there were no signs or symptoms derived from the lesion []."
"A 25 year-old male was referred to our hospital complaining of left knee pain. He had the symptom for 2 years without a prior history of trauma. The pain deteriorated after participating in a Judo competition. He visited a nearby hospital and a radiolucent area of the patella was pointed out on the plain radiograph of a knee. He was suspected of a bone tumor and referred to our hospital. He did not have any relevant family history of tumor or medical history. Physical examination showed a slight atrophy of the left thigh (42 cm compared to his right, which was 45 cm), but did not show tenderness or restriction in range of motion. The overlying skin was smooth without any hotness or redness. Plain radiograph showed a soap bubble-like radiolucent area in the medial patella measuring 1.7×2.4 cm. Periosteal reaction was absent ().\nOn the MRI, the lesion was depicted as low intensity on T1WI and high on T2WI, which was diffusely enhanced after gadolinium-contrast administration. The tumor was composed of multiple cavities, and fluid level was observed in each compartments. There was no obvious invasion to the adjacent muscle or joint ().\nThe tumor was composed mostly from blood filled cavities and intraoperative histological finding revealed a lesion with fibrotic changes and proliferation of histiocyte-like cells and fibroblasts, accompanied by multinucleated giant cells, hemosiderin deposits and bony fragments. No evidence of malignancy was present. Intralesional curettage was performed with the addition of heat ablation and was later filled with artificial bone graft.\nOn histopathology, the tumor was a giant cell lesion with fragmented bones with fibrosis, hemosiderin deposits and mild infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells compatible with ABC. In limited areas, there were monocytes that were short spindle-shaped and slightly positive with S-100 staining, which was consistent with chondroblastoma (,).\nPostoperative period was uneventful. During his 9 months follow-up, no recurrence or arthritic change of the knee has developed ()."
"A 25-year-old female patient visited the hospital due to frequent headaches, and was diagnosed with chronic migraine. There was no specific medical history. She did not effectively respond to various types of pharmacotherapy, and BoNT-A injection was indicated. BoNT-A injections were performed as described above, so that a total of 155 U was injected into 31 sites. At the follow-up appointment 2 weeks later, the patient reported a change in eyebrow morphology, showing the Mephisto sign. An additional BoNT-A dose of 2 U each was administered to the lateral-most point of the frontalis muscle bilaterally. However, the morphology of eyebrow became normalized within 2-3 weeks after this additional injection."
"A 25-year-old female patient weighing 49 kg had severe headache of 1 month duration. Examination of cranial nerves and sensorimotor function of the limbs were normal. On perioperative evaluation, the airway was normal, mallampati was class I, and neck movement was within normal limits. She didn’t have any abnormal anatomical picture or no restriction in jaw joints’ movement. Heart and lung examination were normal. Patient's GCS was 15/15 and cranial nerves examinations were normal. Laboratory studies, including CBC, BUN, Cr, Na, K, BS, PT, PTT, INR, were normal and her blood group A+. Any abnormality couldn’t be seen on the chest radiography.\nWhen the patients were visited in preoperative anesthesia clinic being awake during surgery, type of anesthesia, surgery and the need of patient cooperation was described for them even if it was hard for them. Without prescription of premedication, we got electrocardiogram, pulse oximetery, non-invasive blood pressure NIBP. Under regional anesthesia, we got arterial line for continuous checking of blood pressure. Then we started invasive blood pressure IBP monitoring, and catheterized their bladder. Before starting sensory nerve block, first 1 micg/kg fentanyl and then 25 mg propofol was injected. Scalp nerves block include supraorbital, supra-auricular, lesser and greater occipital with 0.5% marcaine plus epinephrine 1/200,000 was done. The area that pins fixed head separately was infiltrated by lidocaine 2%. Continuous CO2 sampling via nasal canola was done. Oxygen 6 L/min was established through a face mask. To avoid fatigue and discomfort, shoulders, arms, and lower extremities were supported through pillows. Then, continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil 0.3 micg/kg was started. For sedation, a bolus dose of propofol 1 mg/kg was infused and continued by infusion at 30 micg/kg/min. We didn’t carry out monitoring of bispecteral index due to proximity to the surgical side and the need to sterilize skin on the forehead. During the surgery, systolic BP of 56-year-old patient at 110-150 mmHg and 25-year-old patient at 100-130 mmHg was retained. Respiration in 56-year-old patient at 10-15/min and 25-year-old patient at 9-15/min was retained. In both the patients, ET CO2 was maintained at 32-40 mmHg and during surgery, pulse oximetery was maintained at 97-100%. During surgery, for removing lesion, the patients were awake and obeyed the surgeon's commands and moved their limbs and fingers. After removal of the lesion, the patient was asleep, dura matter was sutured. The bone of head was placed and scalp was sutured. The patients, after removing the fixative pin of head slowly woke up, without any unexpected problem."
"A 25-year-old female patient presented with a history of headache, vomiting, and blurring of vision of 2-month duration. On examination the patient was conscious and cooperative. Visual acuity was 6/18 bilaterally. Fundus was normal. Reduction of the left temporal visual field was seen. Pupils were bilaterally symmetrical and reactive to light. CT and contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain [Figures –] was performed which revealed a solid cystic mass lesion involving the hypothalamus and the thalamus displacing and compressing the third ventricle. Inferiorly the lesion was extending into the interpeduncular cistern. The pituitary stalk and optic chiasm were not visualized separately from the lesion. The pituitary gland was normal in location and signal intensity. The solid component of the lesion showed enhancement on contrast administration. A provisional diagnosis of a suprasellar craniopharyngioma was given. The patient was subsequently operated upon and a right frontoparietal craniotomy with subtotal excision was performed. On histopathology the lesion was diagnosed as a hypothalamic glioma []. Post-surgery the patient developed central diabetes insipidus and is currently E4V4M4 status with left hemiplegia."
"A 25-year-old female patient reported to out-patient department with a chief complaint of swelling in the right lower portion of the ear since 6 months. The swelling was painless, asymptomatic, slow growing and esthetically unacceptable for the patient.\nThe swelling was solitary, ovoid in shape, involving the right ear lobe, measuring about 1.5 cm × 1 cm, covered by normal appearing skin, which was stretched and mobile. It was firm in consistency having well-defined margins. Trans-illumination test was negative [].\nSurgical resection was planned with an excisional biopsy. An elliptical incision was placed and the lesion was excised under local anesthesia []. The post-operative period was uneventful with 1 year follow-up and there was no sign of recurrence.\nThe tissue specimen showed a non-encapsulated and well-circumscribed lesion. The cells were arranged in whorls and fascicles []. The cells were spindle shaped with eosinophilic cytoplasm and centrally located basophilic, cigar shaped nucleus. Prominent vascular spaces were seen. There was no evidence of nuclear atypia between the smooth muscle bands; or necrosis or hemorrhage. Thus, the histological diagnosis of solid variant of leiomyoma was made."
"A 25-year-old lady presented to dental out-patient services with swelling and pain in the right side of the face. Local examination showed a fluctuant swelling measuring 5 mm × 3 cm over the right side of the angle of mandible []. The swelling was warm and tender on palpation with signs of impending rupture. Clinical examination of the orofacial region did not reveal any odontogenic or non-odontogenic foci of infection. Patient's vitals were in the normal limits. All the hematological parameters were normal except for borderline leukocytosis and a low hemoglobin level. Incision and drainage (I and D) of the abscess was carried out under local anesthesia. As the patient was in her 12th week of gestation, antibiotics were prescribed in consultation with the gynecologist.\nOn a follow-up visit after 2 weeks, a painless indurated swelling at the same site was noted [, inset]. Pus culture carried out during the incision and drainage had not revealed any bacterial growth. As the condition was not resolving, a fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was advised in consultation with the pathologist, to rule out tubercular infection.\nAspirate from the swelling yielded purulent material. The smears were moderately cellular and showed abundant necrotic debris within which were seen polymorphs and histiocytes. One of the smears revealed the presence of a single microfilaria of W. bancrofti, which was rounded anteriorly and tapered posteriorly []. The caudal end of the microfilariae had a clear space free of nuclei. After the aspiration, the patient was admitted and a midnight blood sample was taken. The wet mount preparation showed motile microfilariae, which confirmed the diagnosis of filariasis.\nSince, the patient was in the first trimester of pregnancy, decision was taken to start the anti-filarial drugs after delivery."
"A man aged 25, with a history of chronic otitis and arrested puberty, was diagnosed as a multidirectional prolactinoma destroying the sella floor and measuring 30 mm × 30 mm × 30 mm []. The PT was responsible for optic atrophy, anterior pituitary insufficiency and diabetes insipidus. Pituitary lesion was diagnosed after SM due to pneumococcal infection. SM was sensitive to antibiotics. Under dopamine agonists PRL was normalized and the tumor volume decreased. After 2 years, there was not any SM relapsing."
"A 25-year-old lady allegedly consumed 200 tablets of ferrous sulphate with suicidal intent. The total dose amounted to 13.5 g of elemental iron (270 mg/kg). She had abdominal pain with vomiting and was given gastric lavage along with supportive care at a primary health center. She was referred to our hospital after 24 h of ingestion for further management. At presentation, she was hemodynamically stable with a normal pulse rate and blood pressure. Complete blood count (CBC) showed hemoglobin-14.1 g/dl, total white blood cell (WBC) count-19,300/cu mm (90% neutrophils) and platelet count-283,000/cu mm. Serum iron level as measured by spectrophotometric analysis was 73 μg/dl (normal range 40-145 μg/dl) and the total iron binding capacity was 350 g/dl (normal range 250-350 μg/dl). Liver function tests (LFT) showed marked elevation in liver enzymes (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]-11,000 U/L and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]-11,420 U/L), total bilirubin (2.6 mg%), direct bilirubin (1.1 mg%), protein (4.6 g%), albumin (2.8 g%) and alkaline phosphatase (161 U/L). Serum creatinine was 1.9 mg%, bicarbonate was 15 mmol/l and blood sugar level was 81 mg/dl. Chelation therapy with desferrioxamine was started as an intravenous infusion of 15 mg/kg/h and increased to 25 mg/kg/h. 24 h after admission, she developed severe gastro-intestinal (GI) bleeding and went into a state of circulatory shock. Hemoglobin dropped from 14.1 to 7 gm%. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 71.3 s and prothrombin time (PT) was 24.5 with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.9. Arterial blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.96. She became progressively drowsy with un-recordable blood pressure, for which she was intubated and ventilated and supported with multiple inotropes. Aggressive blood product supports were given and hemodialysis was initiated for metabolic acidosis. Despite these measures, she continued to deteriorate and died within 36 h of admission due to multi-organ failure."
"A 25-year-old lady was admitted 3 weeks after fourth delivery with 5 days progressive quadriparesis and disorientation with drowsiness for 3 days. She was bedbound and incontinent for 2 days and had symmetric proximally dominant quadriparesis and during recovery was found to have ataxia. Serum CK was 58,587 units/l at admission and reduced to 917 units/l on 15 days from the onset of symptoms when needle EMG was performed. EMG revealed moderate amount of fibrillation and positive sharp waves, which was prominent in proximal muscles. Myotonic discharges were seen in biceps brachii, quadriceps and tibialis anterior []. Left biceps brachii muscle revealed features of extensive rhabdomyolysis, a few regenerating fibers and areas of perivascular infiltration as shown in . Clinical evaluation was normal at 1 month follow-up and serum CK level was 90 units/l."
A 25-year-old lady who had delivered a baby 6 weeks back was admitted with generalized anasarca and paraparesis of 10 days duration. She had dyspnea and oliguria since 1 day. Deep tendon reflexes (DTR) suggested global areflexia and bilateral lower limb power was 3/5. Her thyroid function was normal and Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) was negative. Her investigation results are tabulated in and NCS findings in . A diagnosis of heart failure with polyneuropathy was made and she was treated with IV thiamine infusion and supportive treatment. Edema disappeared over a week and she was discharged after 12 days with near normal power in lower limbs.
"A 25-year-old white female presented in 2006 at age 19 with nephrotic syndrome. Her serum creatinine (SCr) was 0.9 mg/dL (79.6 μmol/L) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [] of 74 mL/min/1.73 m2, serum albumin (SAlb) was 2.9 g/dL (29 g/L) and a urinalysis had 4+ protein and large blood by dipstick. A 24-h urine protein was 6.4 g/day. She had no history of gross hematuria, hearing difficulty or visual changes. Family history was negative for proteinuria, renal failure or AS, but was positive for microscopic hematuria in her maternal grandmother and aunt. A kidney biopsy was performed for the evaluation of nephrotic syndrome and microscopic hematuria.\nLight microscopy (LM) contained six glomeruli, one of which was globally sclerotic. The remaining glomeruli had preserved architecture with delicate basement membranes, patent glomerular capillaries and normal mesangial matrix and cellularity (Figure A). Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis involved 5% of the cortex, and interstitial foams cells (Figure B) affected 10–15% of the cortex. IF demonstrated weak mesangial staining for IgM (trace–1+) and C3 (trace). The tissue was stained with antibodies to the alpha 1, 3 and 5 chains of type IV collagen. This revealed 1–2+ segmental/mosaic staining of the GBM with the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen (Figure ). Staining for the alpha 5 chain of type IV collagen also showed 1+ segmental/mosaic staining of the GBM (Figure ). There was no staining of the dTBM for either the alpha 3 or the alpha 5 chains of type IV collagen. Electron microscopy (EM) demonstrated diffusely thinned GBMs, measuring 124 nm in average thickness (Figure ), but there was no lamellation or splitting. Segmental foot process effacement involved 50% of the total glomerular capillary surface area.\nHeterozygous XLAS was diagnosed based on the ultrastructural findings and the segmental/mosaic IF staining of the GBM and Bowman's capsule and the lack of staining of the dTBM for the alpha 3 and alpha 5 chains of type IV collagen.\nAn angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) was started after the biopsy. In 2012, her SCr rose to 1.6 mg/dL (141.4 μmol/L) (eGFR—38 mL/min/1.73 m2), and she remained nephrotic (urine protein creatinine ratio 3.7 g/g) with microscopic hematuria. Additionally, she developed progressive high-tone hearing loss and now requires hearing aids."
"A 25-year-old 6 months pregnant lady from a rural background was admitted to a private tertiary care hospital in north India with complaints of fever with chills since 4 days. The patient had a BP = 100/60 mm of Hg, pulse = 112 bpm, RR = 22/min, temperature = 101°F, and was maintaining a saturation of 96% with oxygen support at 2 l/min. The patient was dyspneic, had a blanching erythematous rash, pallor (+++) and the fetal heart sounds could be heard. The cardiovascular and neurological examination was, however, normal. A complete blood count with peripheral smear, ELISA for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) for dengue, were sent along with the routine blood examinations. The patient was managed symptomatically and was given supportive treatment.\nThe patient had Hb = 4.1 gm/dl, TLC = 5000/mm3, DLC = P68%, L32%, E0, B0, Platelets = 50,000/mm3, blood urea = 58.8 mg/dl, Sr.creatinine = 1.8 mg/dl, Sr.Na+ = 145 meq/L, Sr.K+ = 4.3 meq/L, total bilirubin = 0.8 mg/dl with a direct bilirubin = 0.7 mg/dl and an indirect bilirubin = 0.1 mg/dl, total serum protein = 3.9 g/dl, Sr.albumin = 2.2 g/dl, Sr.globulin = 1.7 g/dl, Aspartate Amino transferase (AST) = 60 U/L, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) =13 U/L, Sr.Alkaline Phosphatase = 113 U/L. Dengue duo Nonprotein Surface (NS1) antigen combo kit manufactured by standardia using one step rapid immunochromatograpic test for detection of NS1 Antigen and IgG and IgM were employed for the detection of dengue infection. Peripheral smear examination revealed presence of gametocytes of P. vivax and P. falciparum. The histidine rich protein-2 card test was also positive for P. vivax and P. falciparum. A general blood picture was that of markedly reduced red cell mass, red blood cells were microcytic and hypochromic along with anisopoikilocytosis in the form of tear drop cells, target cells and helmet cells. The treatment was accordingly modified and anti-malarials were started in the form of artisunate based combination therapy. Paracetamol in divided doses was given to control the fever and proper care was taken for fetal well-being by fetal sonography. During fetal sonography the amount of amniotic fluid, blood flow through the Doppler study, fetal activity, placenta and cervix were examined to ensure that there was no fetal compromise. The patient was given four units of packed red blood cell transfusion and was discharged after 7 days of in-patient treatment with a live fetus and is on a regular follow-up."
"A 25-year-old woman presented with esotropia of her left eye since the age of 3 to 4 months without any prior strabismus surgery or amblyopia therapy. She was apparently in good health.\nCyclorefraction was +3.74 -0.74 × 135° in her right eye, yielding BCVA of 20/25, and +3.5 -0.5 × 60° in the left eye with BCVA of 20/40. She had mild amblyopia and latent nystagmus in her left esotropic eye with appropriate corrective glasses. Worth-4-dot and Titmus tests revealed left eye suppression and no streopsis. There was bilateral lateral rectus and inferior oblique underaction (-1) together with bilateral superior oblique overaction (+2) with mild A-pattern. The function of other extraocular muscles was normal. While fixating with her right eye, prism alternate cover test revealed 40 and 45 prism diopters (PD) of esotropia in her left eye at far (6 m) and near (33 cm), respectively in addition to hypotropia of 3 PD accompanied by slow variable downward drift from 3 to 6 PD. While fixating with the left eye, there was no change in the position of the right eye. No extorsional movement was observed during downward drift which was not associated with manifest nystagmoid or rhythmic movements. Left eye hypotropia did not change with right or left gaze or head tilt. Slit lamp and fundus examination, and applanation tonometry were within normal limits in both eyes.\nShe underwent bimedial rectus muscle recession equal to 5.25 mm with 1/3 tendon width superior transposition to correct the esotropia and A-pattern simultaneously. Three months after surgery, while fixating with her right eye, mild esotropia and hypotropia of the left eye were occasionally observed (). When fusion was completely broken by the alternate cover test, 8 PD of esotropia and 3 PD of hypotropia with 3 to 4 PD of downward drift were measureable in her left eye (). We did not perform any additional procedure for correction of her hypotropic DVD since she seemed orthophoric most of the time and was satisfied with the result of the operation."
"A 25-year-old man was admitted following a motor vehicle accident. Neurological examination revealed that he was unconscious with a glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 10 [E2V3M5]. He had bilateral periorbital hematoma more on the right side. Visual acuity and extraocular muscle motility of both eyes could not be evaluated completely due to periorbital hematoma, soft tissue swelling, and reduced level of consciousness of the patient. His pupils were bilaterally equal and reactive. Cranial CT axial sections of the head revealed hematoma in the left frontal lobe causing a midline shift along with a depressed fracture of the left frontozygomatic region and a bilateral transverse fracture of the orbital roof []. He underwent surgical evacuation of left frontal contusions, elevation, and removal of depressed segments of the left frontozygomatic bone. A dural tear was also found at the depressed fracture site and duraplasty was done using a pericranial patch. Postoperatively on day 2, he developed rapid progressive proptosis and severe congestion of conjunctiva [] contralateral to the operated site. Fundoscopy was attempted but could not be performed because of periorbital edema. A repeat CT scan of the head was performed in which right frontal contusion had developed with edema []. Orbital CT coronal and axial scan was also performed which revealed the formation of an encephalocele toward the right orbit []. The right globe was displaced laterally, inferiorly, and anteriorly. The optic canal and the optic nerve were intact. The patient underwent right frontal craniotomy wherein the right orbital roof was decompressed, and dural tear and the protruding brain tissue into right orbit were identified (Housepian's approach).[] After excision of the protruding part of the brain microsurgically, the dura was reapproximated with a locked running stitch, and a water-tight closure was achieved. The orbital roof region was covered using temporalis fascia graft. The postoperative period was encouraging, and the right eye proptosis and congestion regressed rapidly [Figure –]. The patient recovered well and was discharged from the hospital on the 16th post-traumatic day when he was conscious with a GCS score of 15 and had intact vision although with mild limitation of movement in the right eye. At a follow-up after three months, cosmetic and neurological recovery was excellent []. At the last follow-up after nine months, the patient was in good health with no neurological deficits. The final visual outcome was excellent, and the patient recovered full vision and had complete range of extraocular motions in both eyes."
"A twenty-five year old male patient, brown-skinned, informed that for the past 9 months\nhe had noticed the appearance of asymptomatic brown spots, on the cervical region,\naxillary, inguinal and popliteal folds. He denied the appearance of other cutaneous\nlesions, pruritus, systemic symptoms, previous diseases or the use of illicit drugs or\nmedications. On examination, we observed hyperchromic, smooth-surfaced macules, with\nwell-delimited edges, measuring from millimeters to centimeters in diameter and often of\nan oval shape ( to ). There were not other lesions either on skin, nails, scalp, or\nmucosae, nor signs of lymphadenomegaly.\nOver the affected skin areas, the direct exams and cultures for fungi and bacteria were\nall negative. Complete blood counts, liver tests and electrolyte results were all within\nthe normal range. Hepatitis C serology was negative. Anatomopathological exams of the\nlesions were performed from distinct samples (right and left axilla), and repeated on a\nthree-month interval with identical characteristics: discreet rectification of\nepithelial cones in the epidermis, irregular hydropic degeneration on the basal layer,\nmarked pigmentary incontinence with the presence of melanophages on the superficial\ndermis and light to moderate inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate surrounding the\ncapillary vessels of the papillary and reticular dermises ( and ).\nBased on the clinical and histopathological features we reached the diagnosis of lichen\nplanus pigmentosus inversus. Afterwards, we initiated treatment with systemic corticoid\nusing prednisone 20mg/day for 30 days, without any therapeutic response. After four\nmonths, without any further treatment, the patient presented with a discreet improvement\non the cervical and popliteal regions, whilst axillary lesions remained unaltered."
"This was a case report of a 25-year-old male patient who presented with the chief complaints of asymptomatic loss of hair at multiple sites over the scalp for 2 month. Hair loss was annular in pattern as it was more obvious at the periphery compared with the center of the patch. There was no history of similar illness in family members and also no history of drug intake and trauma. On examination, there were multiple well-defined annular patches of non-scarring alopecia of size ranging from 2 cm × 3 cm to 4 cm × 4 cm present mainly at parietal and occipital region of scalp []. The area was smooth with no associated skin changes. Systemic examination was within the normal limits. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of hair showed no fungal elements. Fungal culture with Sabouraud's media at 4 weeks revealed no growth. Histopathological examination from the hairless region in scalp showed a few vellus follicles in mid dermis with a sparse perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate []. The dermis and subcutis also showed several follicular stellae representing former follicular papillae. The total number of follicles was substantially reduced with no terminal follicles. On the basis of clinical examination and histopathology, the diagnosis of annular AA was made. Patient was given intralesional injections of trimacinolone acetonide (5 mg/ml) every 4 weeks and showed remarkable improvement in the lesions after 3 months (3 intralesional injections) of follow-up []."
"A 25-year-old software engineer came to emergency department (ED), with a request to get himself tested for HIV infection, even though he did not have any previous episodes of unprotected sexual intercourse or any illicit drug use. However, he said that he has subjected himself willfully to repeated snake bite over a period of 6 months with an interval of 30-45 days between each exposure. Patient was questioned on the awareness of toxic effects of snake venom and he had optimal knowledge. Incidentally, he said that he was stressed very much and had insomnia, due to immense work pressure. As some of his colleagues exposed to snake bite willfully felt relieved of his stress and experienced euphoria, patient accepted for willful snake bite and felt relaxed and had good sleep also. With patient's consent, he was investigated for HIV and his serology was negative. After this episode another friend of primary case, who is also a software engineer of 23 years old, came to ED with same request, as he has subjected himself to willful snake bite. He experienced sound sleep for 20-24 h and had relaxed mind after snake bite without any hang over/head ache, tremor, and sense of crawling. He also felt that his sexual desire has increased. Both of them did not experience any withdrawal symptoms. General and systemic examination including psychological assessment did not reveal any abnormalities in both. Their basic hematological and biochemical profile were within acceptable levels.\nInterestingly, these two cases informed that there are different dens in different cities wherein people who want to have snake bite are allowed to sit in chairs. The person in charge of snakes holds the snake near the head end of snake just distal to lip margin. Initially, he makes the snake to inject minimal bite in little toe or index finger for minimal envenomation, and then, he makes the snake to bite in lip or tongue of individuals according to their wish. The most commonly used snakes were krait, cobra, and green snake. Persons who were bitten, showed jerky movement and left the room within few minutes. From the reports provided orally, six persons lost their life due to such procedure. Many people who use such dens were from high socioeconomic status and well educated. Some of them were youth and college students."
"A 25-year-old male with known thalassemia intermedia, who had never previously required a blood transfusion, presented with a 1-month history of stiffness and weakness in both lower extremities without accompanying sphincteric dysfunction. The general physical examination revealed palpable splenomegaly, while the neurological assessment demonstrated localized tenderness over the D5 level, with attendant 4/5 weakness in both lower extremities, hyperactive bilateral Patellar and Achilles reflexes with bilateral Babinski responses, and a graded sensory loss to pin appreciation below D5.\nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine revealed a posterior, isointense soft tissue epidural mass extending from D2 to D12 on both pulse sequences (T1, T2), suggestive of “red marrow” [Figures and ]. The cord appeared compressed anteriorly, thinned, and atrophic. The vertebral bodies displayed isointense to hypointense signals on both T1WI and T2WI images along with coarsening of the trabecular pattern; these findings suggested a hypercellular bone marrow consistent with EMH. Of interest, the cervical spine MR was normal.\nThe patient was given multiple blood transfusions and it was decided to repeat a MRI after a period of 8 weeks and further treatment plan will be decided based on the MRI findings."
"This 25 year-old woman visited our hospital in September 2002 with the complaints about a poor oral intake and abdominal discomfort. The abdominal examination revealed hepato-splenomegaly and ascites. Computer tomography of the abdomen showed obstruction of intrahepatic inferior vena cava. Insertion of two stents into hepatic vein was performed. The initial hemoglobin level was 14.2 g/dL, WBC 15,520/µL and PLT 375,000/µL. The BM aspiration and biopsy results showed an increased cellularity (80%) with a decreased M:E ratio (0.7). Iron staining revealed a depleted storage of iron. The initial diagnosis was Budd-Chiari syndrome with secondary polycythemia. During one year of the observation, her hematologic profile was within the normal range, except for leukocytosis (ranges: 12,33 0~28,550). The patient experienced recurrent episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. In September 2003 she was admitted to the emergency room and was found dead on arrival. We assume that the cause of the lethal outcome was hepatic failure aggravated by sepsis. After consideration of the JAK2 result, the patient's disease was re diagnosed as PV with a low hemoglobin level resulting from hypersplenism and irondeficiency anemia."
"A 25-year-old woman was admitted to Chonnam National University Hospital with a four-week history of intermittent abdominal pain. She had an 11-year history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. There was no previous history of peptic ulcer diseases, hepatobiliary disease, cholecystitis with gallstones or pancreatitis. On admission, her abdomen was soft and not distended, but was tender to deep palpation in the epigastric region. Physical examination was otherwise within normal limits. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 5,700/mm3 (normal: 6,000-10,000), hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (normal: 12-16), platelet count 285,000/mm3 (normal: 130,000-450,000), serum albumin 3.5 g/dL (normal: 3.0-5.0), aspartate aminotransferase 32 U/L (normal: 5-37), alanine aminotransferase 43 U/L (normal: 5-40), alkaline phosphatase 431 U/L (normal: 39-117), and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 524 U/L (normal: 7-49). The total bilirubin was 0.38 mg/dL with 0.06 mg/dL direct fraction (normal: 0.2-1.2/0.05-0.3). Serum amylase and lipase were within normal range. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a normal-appearing pancreatic head and complete absence of the body and tail (). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP), opacified from the major papilla, showed a short duct in the uncinate process and head and the duct of Santorini draining into the minor papilla (). Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a pancreatic head, but the body and tail were not visualized (). These findings were similar to those of the CT and ERCP. The combined CT, ERCP and MRI findings were considered diagnostic of a partial agenesis of the dorsal pancreas. After symptomatic treatment, she was discharged and followed regularly."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to our hospital after being assaulted. Initial Glasgow Coma Scale was 10/15. Initial CT scan revealed a large amount of acute left frontotemporoparietal SDH and frontal intracranial hemorrhage with uncal herniation to the right. An emergent craniectomy and hematoma removal was performed (). Physical examination showed left side hemiparesis: Motor grade, 2/5; Fugl-Meyer assessment, upper 8+lower 12=20/100; Manual Function Test, left 16/32. After the operation, her cognitive function coincided with a Rancho Los Amigos level of function VI. MRI was obtained 10 days after injury to find the cause of the ipsilateral motor weakness, and abnormal signal change of the right cerebral peduncle contralateral to the primary lesion was detected. The round-shaped region of decreased intensity in the right crus cerebri on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images were observed (). DTI scanning was performed 8 weeks after injury using the same protocol as stated in case 1.\nDTT did not reconstruct right CST around the midbrain due to the lower level of lesion in the T1-weighted image. Also, the CST from the cerebral cortex to the PLIC was not reconstructed. However, CST disrupted in the midbrain level was reconstructed after using different ROI method: one ROI was placed on the CST portion of the anterior lower pons and the other was placed on the CST portion of PLIC (). The FA and ADC values were obtained segmentally as in case 1 on both sides (). Decreased FA value and increased ADC value were noted on the right cerebral peduncle and anterior pons area compared to those on the left side. Four weeks after rehabilitation program, she was independent in ambulation and the motor weakness was improved: Motor grade 3/5. Her cognitive function improved to level VII with Rancho Los Amigos Scale. We re-evaluated the functional status 15 months after the onset of injury. The patient showed gradual improvement of functional abilities. She was able to grasp and release small objects and to ambulate independently: Fugl-Meyer assessment, upper 58+lower 31=89/100; Manual Function Test, left 30/32. However, we could not obtain a follow-up DTI because the patient refused the evaluation."
"A 25-year-old male with schizophrenia developed a hypomanic episode 1 week after the initiation of blonanserin at 8 mg/day. He was first diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2003 at the age of 16 years with symptoms of auditory hallucination and delusions of reference and persecution and has been on various antipsychotic medications for 9 years. The patient did not achieve symptomatic remission, and his course was characterized by intermittent worsening and softening of the referential delusion that others were talking behind his back. He has been on a stable regimen of olanzapine 5-20 mg (final dose 10 mg), aripiprazole 15 mg, clonazepam 0.5 mg, and benztropine 1 mg since 2010. In February 2011, he experienced increased appetite and weight gain; thus, fluoxetine (20 mg) was added to his regimen for 7 months until September 2011 with no mood change.\nIn March 2012, the patient's ideas of reference began to increase and in May, he complained that his neighbors said bad things about him and that the rumors had spread throughout the community. Following this exacerbation, blonanserin 8 mg/day was added to his regimen. Ten days later, the intensity of his delusions decreased, but he developed new symptoms indicative of a hypomanic episode, such as euphoria, elated mood, grandiosity, and hyperactivity. The patient expressed his plan to become a psychiatrist and he wrote poems for several hours per day with the intention of becoming a professional poet. He had a score of 19 on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). One week later blonanserin was withdrawn and the episode ended 4 weeks after discontinuation (YMRS score: 4)."
"A 25-year-old male was brought to the emergency department after being found at the side of the road. At presentation, the patient was unconscious. His vital signs were: blood pressure of 145 mmHg systolic over 122 mmHg diastolic, heart rate of 130 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24, and peripheral oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Physical exam was notable for facial lacerations and a ruptured left globe related to a gunshot entrance wound. No exit wound was identified. A head computed tomography (CT) demonstrated the trajectory of the bullet, which had ruptured his left globe, travelled along the skull base fracturing his carotid canals bilaterally, and was located in the right transverse sinus []. The bullet was round and measured approximately 5 mm in diameter, the characteristic size and shape of a BB gun bullet.\nDue to extensive intracranial haemorrhage, the patient was taken to the operating room for placement of an external ventriculostomy shunt catheter. Post-operatively, contrast enhanced computed tomography angiography of the head was performed, which demonstrated occlusion of the left internal carotid artery []. However, it was also noted that the previously identified bullet was no longer located in the right transverse sinus. At admission, a portable chest radiograph had been unremarkable []. Approximately 2.5 h later, a repeat post-operative chest radiograph showed a new round foreign body resembling a BB that projected over the left hilum with interval development of a wedge shaped pulmonary opacity silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm []. It was suspected that the BB had embolized through the right jugular vein to the patient's heart and to a peripheral branch of a left lower lobe pulmonary artery. Chest CT confirmed that the bullet was now located in a left lower lobe with an associated pulmonary infarct, a small left-sided pneumothorax, and extensive pneumomediastinum [Figure and ]. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery. No intervention to remove the bullet was performed as the patient was critically ill from a neurological perspective."
"A 25-year-old male patient reported with a chief complaint of a mass on the gums in lower right posterior region of the jaw since 10 months. The lesion was painless and asymptomatic, except for the slight discomfort to the patient during mastication. The mass was gradually increasing in size. The patient had undergone surgical excision of the lesion 12 months back at a private clinic. No history of extraction was recalled by the patient and no history of any other systemic disease was present. On clinical examination, a localized, exophytic mass with pedunculated base measuring about 5 × 5 cm size was seen on buccal gingiva in relation to 46, 47 and 48 []. The surface of the lesion was smooth and the mass seemed to be originating from the interdental region. There was spontaneous bleeding on probing. General examination revealed no other abnormalities or cervical lymphadenopathy. No abnormality was detected on hard tissue examination. Teeth in relation to lesion were not mobile and were all vital. Preoperatively an orthopantomogram was taken []."
"A 25-year-old male patient was referred to Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, for the treatment of upper right and left first molar teeth. Intraoral examination revealed fracture of the palatal cusps with respect to 16 and buccal cusp fracture with respect to 26 []. At the time of examination, the teeth were asymptomatic. The teeth were not sensitive to percussion or palpation. Intraoral examination revealed a normal-shaped crown. Periodontal probing was within the normal range. Patient's medical history was noncontributory. Upon vitality testing, 26 showed positive response to thermal and electric pulp testing. The 16 showed no response to thermal and electric pulp testing indicating necrotic pulp. Intraoral periapical radiograph of 16 showed huge pulp chamber extending beyond the cervical area reaching the furcation in the apical third region []. Three short roots were seen at the furcation area in the apical third indicating hypertaurodontism. The intraoral periapical radiograph of contralateral 26 revealed similar findings []. The diagnosis of hypertaurodontism for the present case was made based on the radiographic finding and taurodont index as proposed by Shiffman and Chanannel [].\nThe tooth was anesthetized with lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:1, 00,000 (Lignox 2% A Warren India). Magnifying loupes (Carl Zeiss, India) were used throughout the procedure to facilitate visualization. The tooth was isolated and access cavity prepared. The pulp tissue which was voluminous was extirpated. A total of 2.5% of sodium hypochlorite was used as irrigating solution. The furcation area was situated in the apical third region and three canal orifices were located at the furcation area; palatal, mesiobuccal and distobuccal.\nWorking length determination was performed using electronic apex locator Propex II (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland, USA) and was confirmed with a radiograph []. After working length determination the instrumentation of the canals was done to size 40 for the palatal canal and up to size 30 for the mesial canals using RC prep (Premier, Ultradent, USA) as a lubricanting agent.\nA modified obturation technique was used because of complexity of inner root canal anatomy. This consisted of combined lateral condensation of the gutta percha in the apical part with vertical compaction of the remaining pulp chamber. AH-plus (Dentsply, Switzerland, USA) was used as a root canal sealer. The final radiograph confirmed well-obturated root canal system []."
"A 25-year-old male patient presented with a past history of opioid-dextropropoxyphene (DPP) intoxication seizure with no family history of either seizure or any substance abuse, after remaining abstinent for ~1.5 years restarted DPP, which was followed by another episode of generalized seizure. However, he continued DPP in dependent pattern for last 4 months."
"A 25-year-old woman presented to the acute surgical team with a 24-hour history of sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, worsening in severity. She had an associated fever, malaise and anorexia. She did not complain of any urinary symptoms, dyspareunia or vaginal discharge. At the time of presentation, she was approximately midway through a regular menstrual cycle. She was otherwise fit and well with no previous medical history and on no regular medications. She did admit to a diarrheal illness one month previously during which an out-patient stool culture had grown Campylobacter jejuni.\nOn examination, she was noted to be tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and fever at 38.0°C. She was tender throughout the lower abdomen, mostly in the suprapubic area with guarding. Urinalysis was negative for blood, nitrites and leukocytes and a urinary pregnancy test was negative. Her blood investigations revealed a raised white cell count of 19.1 (normal range 4 – 11 109/L) and a C-reactive protein of 3 (normal range 0 – 10 mg/L). An ultrasound examination was not performed. She was discussed with the gynecology team who agreed with our management plan to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy and was available to attend theater if required.\nDiagnostic laparoscopy was performed via a 10 mm infraumbilical camera port and a 5 mm left iliac fossa instrument port. A small collection of pus was noted in the pelvis although the uterus, ovaries and appendix were macroscopically normal. The pus subsequently showed pus cells on microscopy but no organisms were cultured. On inspection of the small bowel, primarily in search of a Meckel’s diverticulum, a 160 mm length of cystic and nodular change involving the mid-ileum and neighboring mesentery was found. The rest of the small bowel was normal. One cystic lesion on the posterior aspect of the mesentery had ruptured with evidence of surrounding induration []. The left iliac fossa stab incision was lengthened to 40mm, creating a mini-laparotomy incision to enable resection of the effected length of small bowel and a hand-sewn end-to-end bowel anastomosis was performed. The resected bowel was opened along its antimesenteric border and cystic disease affecting both the mesentery and bowel wall was confirmed []. Her post-operative course was uneventful and she was discharged home 5 days after surgery.\nHistology identified these changes as localized intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic cyst disease. Dilated lymphatic channels were noted to extend throughout the full thickness of bowel wall and into the mesentery []."
"A 25-year-old female was referred to our GI Surgery Unit for unexplained fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the last 10 days. There was a past history of similar episodes over the last year. At presentation, she had jaundice, fever and large soft cystic swelling occupying the entire upper abdomen. Laboratory investigations revealed total bilirubin 8 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 1230 U/L, ALT 200 U/L and AST 93 U/L. The ultrasonographic examination demonstrated a huge thick walled cystic lesion with internal echogenic particles and septations that extended from the subhepatic area to the left hypochondrium, separate from liver. There were cystic dilatations of intrahepatic ducts. An MRCP examination disclosed a huge cystic dilatation of the common bile duct measuring 12 cm in diameter (). Another separate, large-septated cystic lesion with homogenous fluid signal intensity, measuring 12 cm×10 cm×9 cm (), was seen at porta hepatis contiguous with an extrahepatic segment of left hepatic duct extending to the left hypochondrium. With these findings, the provisional diagnosis of a huge type, IVA choledochal cyst with enormous tortuous dilatation of the extrahepatic segment of the left hepatic duct was considered.\nPercutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was done as the patient went into toxic cholangitis and she was not fit for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP). Subsequently, cholangitis subsided and she was taken up for the surgery after optimization of the coagulation and nutritional status. Intraoperative findings were a large thick walled folded cyst measuring approximately 15 cm arising from the extrahepatic segment of left hepatic duct in continuation with a huge dilatation of CBD confirming the finding of MRCP.\nThe extrahepatic component of the cyst was excised and biliary-enteric flow was re-established through a wide mucosa to mucosa Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy at the level of the hilum. At 10 months of follow up, the patient was doing well."
"A 25-year-old woman, at 22 weeks gestation, presented with excessive vomiting for several weeks followed by progressive weakness of lower limbs, altered sensorium, and blurred vision. Her previous pregnancy had resulted in fetal loss, due to hyperemesis. On admission, she had stable vitals, with 7/15 Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Physical examination revealed sluggishly reacting pupils with papilledema, left sided facial twitching with ptosis of the eye, bilateral conjugate palsies with nystagmus, and flaccid paralysis of all four limbs with bilateral flexor plantar reflexes. Fetal sonography was normal. Her serum biochemistry during her stay is shown in . MRI finding was suggestive of WE [Figures and ]. She was electively intubated and ventilated and was administered intravenous thiamine 100 mg thrice daily along with other vitamins, electrolytes, and trace elements. Gradually, her ocular signs disappeared and she showed neurological recovery with improvement in muscle power.\nHowever, within next few days, her general condition deteriorated and she became hyperpyrexic (>40° C). A repeat MRI (brain) was highly suggestive of CPM []. She underwent lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) at 30 weeks and a male baby was delivered (weight 800 g, APGAR 6 and 8). Unfortunately, patient died of multiorgan failure on 4th postoperative day."
"A 25-year-old man, with a background history of multiple sclerosis in remission for two years came to the Accident and Emergency department with weakness in his right arm and leg for 6 h. He also had ataxia. There was no focal/urinary incontinence or visual disturbances. He was started on methyprednisolone 1 g intravenously. On the third day, the patient had jerky movements and shivering. Axillary temperature was recorded at 38.6°C. He also had dysarthria, past pointing and blurring of vision and nystagmus. He was very anxious, tearful, and apprehensive; diagnosis of psychosis was made, and the patient was started on olanzepine 2.5 mg BD. He also had a lumbar puncture done for nystagmus and ataxia. On the sixth day patient was tachypneic and had tachycardia. He was very drowsy. Temperature recorded in the axilla was 45°C. Leucocyte count was 22,000 cells/mm3. Creatinine kinase (CK) levels were 15,650 u/L [normal 30-190 u/L], serum alanine aminotransferase was 146 [normal 15-45] and alkaline phosphatase was 660 [normal < 300]. Patient was tachycardic, diaphoretic with incontinence and altered consciousness. Patient was intubated and electively ventilated. His CK levels continued to rise. His urine output decreased with increasing levels of creatinine and urea. Hemodialysis was initiated due to oliguria and rising renal parameters. The temperature was measured continuously via a rectal probe. At all times temperature was above 40°C. A diagnosis of Neuroleptic malignant hyperthermia was made. Arterial lines and a central line were inserted. Patient was well hydrated. Active cooling measures were initiated. Bloods were closely monitored for evidence of Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and electrolyte imbalance. An antipyretic was started. Patient was started on bromocryptine 5 mg NG TDS, Dantrolene 200 mg IV QDS, baclofen 10 mg TDS and clonidine 100 micrograms BD. The symptoms of NMS started resolving after nearly 4 h. The tachycardia and muscle rigidity had significantly reduced by the first day. Patient made a complete recovery in two days. MRI of the brain revealed extensive plaques in brainstem and swelling of the brain. A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with superimposed acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was made. The patient was extubated three days."
"A 25-year-old female with chromosomal abnormality, and severe combined pectus excavatum and carinatum deformity presented with a large mediastinal mass. T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images illustrate the exquisite soft tissue contrast, detail, and extent of a complicated cystic mass consistent with lymphatic malformation []."
"A 25-year-old female (gravida 2 para 1) was seen by a radiologist for evaluation of polyhydraminos. Her previous anomaly scan reports were normal. Ultrasound evaluation of the fetus revealed no significant abnormalities []. Fetal spine and facial structure were normal. Fetal stomach bubble was seen and was found to be relatively small in size. Placenta was normal. Amniotic fluid volume was greater than normal, amniotic fluid index (AFI) measured 45 cm. Some problem in fetal swallowing due to small stomach and polyhydraminos was suspected. A fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done to evaluate cause of acute polyhydramnios and relatively small size of the stomach.\nFetal MRI done on 1.5 T Philips Achieva magnet with T2W turbo spin echo sequences and balanced turbo field echo sequences. Sagittal [] and axial [] images show well-defined mixed intensity lesion with cystic component measuring about 4.5 × 3.5 cm in the oropharyngeal region. No obvious sign of invasion of hard palate or nasopharynx was noted []. No other significant abnormality was noted in the fetus. No destruction of facial structure was found. Large amount of amniotic fluid was seen []. The lower and mid regions of the trachea were well visualized. The mandible appeared normal [].\nBecause of polyhydramnios and severe maternal discomfort, cesarean section was done at 35 weeks. After birth, the baby was found to be hypoxic with difficulty in breathing. Baby was intubated and airway was maintained. Surgery for tumor removal was planned and done on the fourth day after birth. At surgery, well-defined lobulated tumor measuring about 4.5 × 3.4 cm arising from palate was resected [] and sent for histopathology examination. Post surgery, baby recovered well. Histopathology report proved it as immature teratoma [Figures and ]. After 4 weeks, the baby's serum alfa-feto-proteins were found to be elevated to 600 ng/ml. Parents were advised to consult a medical oncologist, who advised follow-up after 6 months. After 6 months, positron emission tomography - computed tomography [] was done to rule any recurrence. The scan showed no signs of any recurrence or metastasis. Serum alpha-feto-protein was repeated and found to be 180 ng/ml. Medical oncologist advised chemotherapy and radiation but the parents did not agree to this treatment. Presently, the boy is 27 months old and doing well without any clinical symptoms."
"A 25-year-old female with epigastric pain on and off for 3 months was admitted with sub acute intestinal obstruction. She improved on conservative treatment. CT showed mal-rotated gut. Laparoscopic Ladd's procedure was done.\nProcedure time ranged from 25-40 min.\nAll the patients, when asked, confirmed that symptoms were present since childhood and either ignored or treated with common household remedies.\nOral liquids started after 6 h and all three patients were discharge on second postoperative day. These patient, now in more than 6 months follow up, are doing well."
"A 25-year-old male presented to the Accident and Emergency Department with an alleged history of a road traffic accident. On examination, he had a painful right hip with no other injury. On plain radiograph of both hip, he was diagnosed as having a sub-trochanteric fracture of right femur. The patient was posted for percutaneous femoral nailing. During surgery, after threading over the nail when the K wire was to be removed, it fractured and during an attempt at retrieval by the orthopaedician through the same hole, it was further pushed into the pelvis through the acetabulum plate []. The orthopaedic procedure was completed, and the patient was referred to the surgical unit for retrieval of the fractured segment of the K wire.\nAs the patient was stable, we conducted a contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis [], in which the broken fragment of the K wire was seen protruding through the acetabulum into the right hemi-pelvis between the bladder and rectum, without any obvious injury to surrounding structures. The patient was planned for laparoscopic retrieval under general anaesthesia with C-arm guidance, if required.\nA midline infra-umbilical 10 mm camera port was placed, and two 5 mm ports were further placed, both in the left mid-clavicular line, one at the level of umbilicus, and the other at the level of the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine. On inspection, there was no free fluid in the abdomen and no evidence of any bowel or vascular injury. The tip of the K wire was not visible either. In the pelvis, just lateral to the bladder and approximately at the level of the right Cooper's ligament, a blunt protrusion of the peritoneum was identified. The peritoneal flap was raised, and with sharp dissection, of superficial tissues, the pointed metallic K wire was seen [], and retrieved with the help of a needle holder. No bleeding was seen, and the peritoneal flap was closed. Post-operatively, the patient recovered uneventfully."
"A 25-year-old female presented with complaints of malaise, weight loss, and diffuse abdominal pain, more inthe umbilical region since 1-2 months. Pain was aggravated with meals and relieved with fasting. On examination, her blood pressure was 160/92 mm Hg in right arm and 158/90 in left arm; lower limb blood pressure was 126/80 in right lower limb and 128/82 in left lower limb. Pulse rate was 90 per minute, regular, good volume with no radiofemoral delay. A renal bruit was heard on the left side. Rest of the systemic examination was within normal limits. Complete blood count, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and urine routine microscopy were within normal limits. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was raised to 35 mm/hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) was more than 5 mg/L. Her chest X-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG) were normal. Her fundus examination was normal. Serology for HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) were negative. Complement levels were normal. Ultrasonography (USG) of the abdomen was normal. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax and abdomen was done, which revealed thickening of the descending aorta upto bilateral renal artery origin with thickening of the superior mesenteric artery. CT angiography was done, and it revealed wall thickening of the descending aorta with narrowing of lumen. There was also thickening of the superior mesenteric artery with narrowing of lumen. Pulmonary trunk and bilateral pulmonary arteries were also normal. There was evidence of a heterogeneous, hyperdense region in the left medial basal segment deriving its arterial supply separately from the aorta. There was no direct communication with the tracheobronchial tree, and the heterogeneous lung segment had no separate pleural covering. The above-mentioned findings were suggestive of an intralobar pulmonary sequestration []. Bilateral renal artery showed stenosis with involvement of the ostia and proximal segment with post-stenotic dilatation []. The other branches of the abdominal aorta were normal. The thoracic aorta and its branches were also normal in course and caliber. The findings were consistent with large vessel vasculitis."
